1	  These are not what I expected based on the reviews I read & price paid . They are on the flimsy side IMO & do not sound any better than most other cheaper & flimsy headphones I 've tried . If I had to do it over again & would have spent more & bought some Grados .  
1	  I have just received this and didn't think the hiss people have mentioned would be that bad but it is simply awful ! I will be returning this item as soon as possible . I tried both the included microphone , another external mic as well as hooking up a linein . And for technology in this day and age we shouldn't be hearing such terrible quality recordings .  
1	  This product comes with virtually no help to work with it . Customer support was weak saying that they would not help with other software issues such as copying outlook express . The computer connection cord is ridiculously short . There are better products out there at prices much lower  
1	  While the Apex DRX-9200 is a better-quality product than its predecessor ( which has been discontinued ) , it still feels low-quality when compared to Panasonic DVD recorders . It also does * not * work with DVD-R or DVD-RW , but only the " plus " format . I think it looks a bit ugly and is a bit on the heavy side . But the main problem is the future of Apex Digital . According to the New York Times ( 12/28/04 ) , the company owes its Chinese supplier over half a billion dollars in unpaid bills , and its president was arrested by the Chinese police for " [ .. ] . " From the recent lack of new products from this company and the horrible customer support it provides to customers , I 'll caution anyone about buying an Apex . Yes this is a bargain , but if yours doesn't work a couple months from now , you might not be able to get it fixed . ( But then again , this recorder is only $ 120 after rebate .. )  
2	  We got this for traveling and it is very easy to use . We took it on a trip right after getting it and it was amazing . Simple to use and very accurate . We like the voice directions in addition to the map . It doesn't come with a in-depth owners manual and after using it we knew why ; it is very self explanatory . We highly recommend it .  
1	  .. for about two months . I had to eventually return this item and get a refund . It would still charge my iPod , but the volume wouldn't turn up after those two months . Don't buy it unless you want a big hassle returning it and searching for another one .  
1	  I bought this scanner on the advice of a friend who uses one for scanning negatives , and color photos , this scanner was a waste of money , it seems to increase the red tone in negatives and color photos , making them impossible to see what they are .  
2	  I bought this printer from amazon . com . Nicely arrived before scheduled time . Great photo printing . Copying is very cool , with features like both color or b / w . Really enjoying it . Both side printing kind of works sometime . These printers are great product for such a low price , because they planned to make money from the ink you buy . They have chips in their ink catridges to avoid you going after market catridges for refills . If you do choose go after market catridges , changing the chip from old oem catridge into after market catridge is little bit harder . But you will loose nice elegant feature , monitoring ink level functionality from the computer . And you have start monitoring ink level manually atleast once a each week .  
2	  High quality filter . Creates warmer ( as per the name ) look in many images . My wife loves how it helps her pale skin tone look a little more brown and lifelike . I leave it on my camera lens all the time . A filter is one of those things that is very personal opinion . Try it for yourself - if you like it , keep it . If not , return it . I like mine . Some are cheap and use cheaper glass . This one seems good .  
1	  I purchased the LDP-200 so that I could play Windows Media files that I store on the SD card that I usually use in my PDA phone . I don't want to risk damaging the phone while participating in adventure recreation . The only thing weaker than the LDP-200 firmware is Lexar 's customer support . They are uninformed , lazy , unresponsive , and entirely too quick to dismiss problems . In theory it 's a great device . Cheap , small , simple , flexible . For the price you can forgive that it doesn't include features like playlists , and doesn't resume tracks where you left off . What is not forgivable are the MAJOR undisclosed limitations of the file management system programmed into the Version 0.5 firmware ( the only known publicly available firmware version ) . With no playlist capability it 's critical to be able to sort music by folders . The problem is that the LDP-200 is only able to read 40 folders / directories regardless of how they are organized ! The count begins with all folders in the root path of the SD card and then continues with the next level of subdirectories in alphabetical order and so on . So let 's say I sort my music by artist then album , if I have an average of two albums per artist and I cherry pick my tracks so that I only have an average of 3 songs for each album I can only play 76 songs . Worse yet if I 'm storing photos or data in other directories on my SD card as Lexar says you can do , depending on how many folders I have dedicated to them I might not be able to browse / play ANY music at all ! Furthermore even if I opted to place all media files in one folder the LDP-200 is limitted to reading only 130 music files per folder . This is especially bothersome for someone who shelled out the extra cash for a high capacity card . As for Lexar 's customer service . Before purchasing the device I inquired with customer support if the device could support SD cards larger than 1GB . I was told no . I reserched reviews and discovered it supports all FAT32 Formatted SD cards . So I bought the device and verified it . ( Note : I also performed my file management tests on a 128MB SD card ) . When I reported to them that directories and media files in certain directories were not visible to the player and that I could make them visible by renaming directories to start with letters earlier in the alphabet they told me to format my card and recreate my files . When I pushed the issue and provided them links to similar customer feedback with examples on how to recreate the problem they told me they used my file structure and there " should not " be a limit to the number of directories . When I provided them with further guidance on how to recreate the problem they simply sent me a form letter response saying they were sorry I was having problems with my device ( not acknowledging that there is a problem with their firmware ) and they 'd get back to me . It 's been over a week and I haven't heard anything . For those of you that already own the device I strongly encourage you to perform the tests yourself and report back here with your results and DEMAND that Lexar resolves the firmware bug to make it function AS ADVERTISED . If you don't already own one don't buy one until they have released a firmware and you have read reports that the problem has been resolved . In the meantime you may be interested in a different MP3 player / SD card reader such as : SanDisk e100 SeriesGrand MP3MyMusic PD201Coby MP SeriesI can't say that any of these work better but I would certainly reserearch them before purchasing the LDP-200  
1	  If there were a zero star option it would have gotten it . I have to say , I am more than disappointed with the quality that came with this toner . Not only is this a terrible and useless cartridge , but it 's the second one that I have received being that I already returned the first one that had the same issues . As the first reviewer says , there are black marks on both sides of the page and when you hold the pages you get toner all over your hands . Any type of picture or photo has giant gobs of toner and the roller on the toner cartridge is covered in toner . Do yourself a favor , spend a few more bucks and get a toner cartridge that will work . If the company would like to try and rectify itself again , I am open to it , and I will rescind my review , or at least reconsider , but I have to say I have my doubts as this is the second time that I have tried to get a cartridge that works .  
1	  The film was delivered promptly , however , the film was not sold as pictured in the box and no way to tell how old the film was . I have developed 3 of the rolls with poor results . I am going to possibly take my remaining two rolls to another developer , but I am not holding my breath . I will not be ordering from Amazon for this product again .  
1	  I 'm pretty particular about having clean records , and when I use this brush I find it very inadequate . As others have reported , it will scratch the surface of your record ! This may not be an audible type scratch , but I 'm not sure about that . The way to view it scratching is to slide it onto a portion of the record near the center where there are no groves .. Under normal use I 've watched with a flash light to see if I 'm picking up anything .. and unless it is laying on the surface of the record it 's not coming off . On another turntable I use an old ESL dust arm that is far more successful in aiding in keeping the surface as clean as possible while playing . Unfortunately that dust arm is no where to be found these days .. but there is a new type that is similar available on the internet that I will try out soon .  
2	  My husband and I both got this bag for hauling our books and 17 " dell laptops to school . It is a really big bag , I thought it would look gaudy but it doesn't . It 's got ample room for my laptop and books for like 4-5 classes . I like the drink sleeve on the side , with a slide thingy to keep it locked in place , no matter what the size . One great feature is that the shoulder straps , on the top part , are space far enough apart for guys to have it on their backs . A guy friend of mine has a different laptop backpack cannot wear his because his shoulders are too broad , he 's got to wear it over the shoulder . Also , the straps are adjustable . While the pack is on , you can tighten the straps and when you need to take it off , one hand is all you need to loosen it up if you need too . There are compartments for your cell phone , pens , etc . You will not be disappointed . Amazon is also the cheapest I have found this for .  
1	  I am pretty technical , but this watch is very very difficult to use . I just wanted to check my altitude for skiing , and even when I figure it out , I have to read the manual the next time I ski  
1	  Creative has removed the AC adapter from the included items , and the only place where Amazon mentions it is in the detailed tech info . I feel cheated . I dont know why Creative would do such a thing .. , when all along they were trumpetting the valuse for money vis a vis iPod .  
1	  I ordered this as a gift , and wanted to have it all set up and ready to go for Christmas . Since I already have a Visor Deluxe and am thrilled with it , I figured the new Prism would be as top-notch a performer as the Deluxe was , right from the get-go . Unfortunately , the unit I received is defective ; no matter what I try , the batteries will not charge . I suspect the cradle is defective on my unit . First , I went to Handspring 's website for help , and followed their suggestions , but the unit still would not work . I then contacted Handspring 's customer support via e-mail , and they suggested I do a hard reset , which did not remedy the situation , either . Then , I called them direct and spoke with a representative , who reviewed everything with me and was very helpful , but still , the unit would not charge . The rep told me they would promptly send a replacement unit , but could not guarantee me that the Prism they would send would be brand new ( said they might send a refurbished unit instead ) ! That was not acceptable to me , especially when I paid for a brand new unit ! So , I called Amazon and they are sending a replacement unit which I hope will work . Amazon has been very helpful in getting me a replacement Prism in time for Christmas ! I am sending the original one back ; I guess I was one of the unlucky souls who got a defective unit .  
2	  I purchased four of these so I can put books on them for my mother in law . We found even with her poor vision she can read the screen to select chapters , a feature not in my old shuffle and at a good price . They work very good , can be loaded by my MAC or PC and have a fine FM radio . Give them a try .  
2	  Once I realized I needed to turn the volume way up and control the volume with the headset only they are the greatest , I love the level control for left and right ear volume greatly helps to compensate for the imbalance in my hearing .  
2	  in general I start reading the one star reviews in Amazon in order to see commonality of the worst case with the product . Yes , this is not a top tip quality cable but it 's okay not actually it is not a piece of garbage . It 's quality and integrity is pretty okay for cable that is only a few bucks . Don't worry about if it is carry 1080P signal . There is no problem with any HD resolutions . I highly recommend this cables for regular use .  
2	  Simple cable , works great with my iMac and external HDD ; it 's more reliable than adapter .  
1	  You can add my name to the list of " victims " on this product ! I also bought this DVD Player 18 months ago as part of a Home Theater system which included the Onkyo TX SR600 Receiver / Amp and the fantastic Bose Acoustamass 15 speakers . No complaints on the receiver or speakers , but the DVD player started acting up after 12 months and has now just quit altogether . It lights up but can't get the drawer to open . I found all of these negative reviews while researching a replacement , which I guarantee will NOT be another Onkyo .  
1	  This product did not work . The audio only lasts 5-10 seconds . If I turn it off and then on or hit the resync button , I get 5-10 more seconds of audio . It doesn't matter how close I am to the base . I had recentely sent back my RS140 's to be fixed ( they worked great for 2 years ) . I won't be purchasing any refurbished units again .  
2	  Ladies and Gents , Please remember that passing judgment on ANY head / ear phone is an extremely personal undertaking . First - we ALL hear differently and Two - What we consider as GOOD is extremely personal . So if someone is happy with the $ 3 earphone that came with their digital player , God Bless ' em . These folks will need a personal encounter with a superior set of phones before they ' Get-It ' . Once we get into IEMs and ICMs type earphones , we have a new layer of complications - What is a good fit ? As you may know , the manufacturers , provide fitting info and MANY sleeves , some even provide online video to try and get the idea across . Visit everyones site , maybe your model 's instructions " don't communicate " but reading another 's info - does get the concept across . Four basic points :( A ) Don't make any assumptions as to which ear piece SHOULD fit , as you will read folks tell of how the KNEW it was the ' large ' that would work - only to find it was the ' small ' that actually gave the best fit . MAKE NO ASSUMPTIONS ! TRY ALL THE ' SLEEVES ' , sizes and types ! ( B ) The easiest way to know if you 've got a seal - Once in , make a eating or yawning action , if you hear a ' psst ' type sound , the seal is NOT there , you shouldn't hear ANY surrounding sounds , it should feel like an earplug ( known as ' sound isolating ' ) . If you don't know what an earplug feels like , buy a box of cheapies at the local " XYZ " and play ; once you understand how an earplug seals , it will be easier to recognize a proper fit for your IEM / ICM * phones . ( C ) PLEASE remember that the better the quality of the phones , the more the phone will highlight the failings of digital compression on music . Someone noted that he was re-ripping because he felt his current source material @ 320 wasn't good enough for his UE5s . My personal recommendation to my " audio-head " friends is to use a LOSSLESS codec , or to go with WAV files - of course this requires that you use a HardDrive player with 60GB or larger . The simple reality is that most of the better phones are BETTER than MP3s @ 64 , 128 , 256 , and even 320 . You should always review a better phone with CDs ! ( D ) When testing your phones , you should test THEM , meaning NO equalizer , NO bass or treble , NO BBE , SRS , etc . , no additional shaping of the music at all . You should judge the phones themselves , and if you have to add processing ( sound shaping ) to most of your music - these are NOT the right phones for YOU . * IEM / ICM = In Ear Monitor and In Canal Monitor , the differnce is that the ICM fits deeper into your ear than a IEM , and usually provide more isolation from the outside world than an IEM . Folks shouldn't complain so much - for there are a plethora of good phones currently available , AND customer service these days IS better in this arena than with MOST electronic products . Remember - the products you purchase from Etymotic Research , Shure , and Ultimate Ears ( in particular ) are really professional products or minimally developed from pro models . Things have never been this good for the ear . Unfortunately the source material , compressed music , has gotten worst . Folks have to deal with the fact that compressed music is just a bit ahead of AM radio , and most isn't better than FM radio . If you can't be happy with an ER4 , a SE310 , or an UE5 - there are still better phone available to you , but most folks should find any of the above to be " ear candy " . CAUTION WILL ROBINSON ! Because IEM / ICMs seal the ear , they usually require LESS volume and if you insist on using higher volume levels , prepare to be fitted for a hearing aide when you get older , not to worry - that will be a custom fit . I hope some of my ramblings prove useful , and remember : I 's about the MUSIC ! NOT about the toys ! Best , a .  
2	  I live in a bottom floor apartment on the end of the building away from Direct TV transmitters . When I prepared for the switch to DTV , I installed a converter box from Radio Shack along with a DTV antenna . It worked , but not reliably due to the nature of DTV signals being better in ' line of sight ' applications , low gain , and disruption when people move around in the room . I had to constantly adjust the antenna , which was pretty directional in it 's design . I had to admit I made a poor choice in my haste to switch . I looked around for an alternative and found the DB2 . Yes , it is an outdoor antenna , and I cannot install it outside at my apartment , but it turns out to be livable . I have it mounted on the post of an old torchiere lamp near the TV . The reason I bought it is because of the high gain and Multi Directional nature of the design . It works far better than the last antenna I tried . I don't receive all the signals I could receive if I lived in the top floor closest to the transmitters , but the channels I receive are solid , clear pictures without needing to move the antenna all over the place . I also suggest that if you have any understanding of the nature of analog broadcast signals , that you look up the nature of digital broadcast signals . They are different in performance and may help you understand what to do to increase the quality of your receiving installation , especially if your are in a fringe area . The DTV website was very helpful to me .  
1	  When I got this puppy I was pleasently surprised by its functionality and performance , especially the sound quality . The remote is almost perfect and makes navigation quite simple . This could be a great alternative to the iPod if the batteries didn't die on me after 1.5 hours of constant listening . That 's right . The first day I had no problem with batteries , I think I listened to that thing for 5 or 6 hours straight . But once you recharge them , or discharge and recharge , forget about listening to it longer than 1.5 hours . There is an external battery charger , but then the whole idea of ' slim ' goes away . So unless you 're eager to carry all that additional weight in an unattractive carrying case , don't bother buying this player . Save your money and get an iPod . I got no problem fitting 190 mp3 's on one cd and that was plenty for me , but so what if I can listen to half of them on the go ? Think twice before you buy this player . I 'm returning mine .  
1	  I went for the lowest cost machine , but that was a mistake I won't repeat . The TEAC W-600R worked great for two weeks ( about the time it took me to dub 15 tapes to my PC ) . Then , the drive mechanisms in both bays stopped working and the machine began to produce loud clicking sounds . No amount of turning the machine off / on or hitting buttons worked to correct it . The unit is junk and is being returned .  
2	  We absolutely love this camera . This was an upgrade from our S400 which died on us after about 4 years . The large screen on the back is HUGE and allows you to see enough detail on your picture to know whether or not you got the shot you wanted . Additionally , the controls are intuitive and displayed very clearly on the screen . We 've had a few grainy pictures but nothing that 7.1 mega-pixels couldn't fix . By the time we shrunk the pictures down to print size the graininess disappeared . Overall a great buy .  
1	  Bought this last Christmas and it worked great for one plane trip . After that the screen would cut out after a couple of minutes . Now its useless . Good looking but poor quality . I would not recommend wasting your time on it .  
1	  This product has been a nightmare . I bought it a year ago when I got my Olympus C2100UZ digital camera . Since then , I 've had the following problems : 1 . When windows says it 's done copying files , i remove the card only to find a read-write error that it wasn't complete after all . 2 . Copy errors ( files not accessable ) when copying data to my CF card for use in my Pocket PC . 3 . EUSBMSD . SYS file ( used for this card reader ) would hard crash my system when playing games ( Dark age of camelot ) or using my cd-burning software ( NERO ) . 4 . Their " winXP certified drivers " don't do anything . It 's the same problems . 5 . Had two cards of holiday pictures . Inserted card A and copied all files off . Then deleted the pics off the card . Inserted card B , and found that there were no pictures ! Inserted Card A again , and the pictures that I DELETED were still there ! So now i 'm out 148 pictures thanks to this defective product . Avoid this at all costs , i 'm sure there are better , more reliable readers out there .  
1	  I got this mp3 player as a birthday present and i was really excited because i had wanted one . The software had a lot of problems resulting in a lot of changes to my computer system . Some of the songs i had wouldn't load on to the mp3 player even though they were in mp3 format and the songs i could get to load would skip and were very bad quality . The power switch which controls on / off / hold functions fell out almost every time i used it , and if you have seen this mp3 player you know that the switch is pretty small . So after i took off the backpack and opened up the mp3 player i had to get out my tweezers and carefully place the switch plate back on to the actual switch that is about the size of a pinhead . Not Very fun since music is my life and i bring my mp3 or Cd player every where i go . So , if you are considering this mp3 player , DON'T BUY IT !  
2	  I purchased this headset a little over two years ago . After 2 years of using it 6 + hours a day most days I am finally replacing it with another of the same . I found it to be excellent quality and very comfortable , and it worked great . I am replacing it only due to a damaged cord , not normal wear and tear . Had the cord not been damaged , I could see this excellent headset lasting another two years easily .  
1	  I didn't buy this product from Amazon , but another retailer for the same reason as many others - the savings . Unfortunately it 's a complete rip off . We tried to install 4 of the 6 cartridges . Two of them were fine and showed full ink levels . The other two , however , had major issues . One was COMPLETELY empty . No ink in it at all . The other was replacing an ' expired ' cartridge and when I put the brand new cartridge in I kept getting an error message saying the cartridge was missing or damaged . I put the ' expired ' cartridge in and it was fine . So I contacted HP for help .. after running several of their tests their only option since my printer is out of warranty , is to offer me a discounted price on a refurbished printer . Really ? I don't need a new printer , I need the two bum cartridges replaced . Since I bought the package and already installed two of the other cartridges with no issue , there 's no way to return it to the original retailer . If you buy this product make sure to keep everything and get it from a place that will let you return / exchange partially used products ! Unfortunately now I have to go spend $ 20 on top of the $ 40 for the set to replace the two bad cartridges . Not worth it .  
2	  The CX5400 currently sells for $ .. , maybe less with rebates and other incentives . is it worth it ? YUP ! This badboy copies , prints and scans just like the older CX5200 model that was discontinued by Epson but it also does borderless printing and its quiet ! See $U$ for full specs . SETUP - a breeze , open up the box , remove all that funky tape , plug it in , insert the 4 cartridges , flip that scanner lock switch , install the software , plug in the usb port . Took me 5 minutes , no problems at all . NOISE - Only noise this unit makes is when its first turned on , it initalizes and does all kinds of stuff , takes 2 mins , when its idle , its whisper quiet . When it prints , there is only the humm of paper being printed , not loud at all , the CX5200 made a horrible sound when it printed , they fixed it in this unit . SPEED - print speed is very fast , b & w ; or color - no waiting for it to catch up . i printed 20 pages that came out before my coffee was even cold . Best photo printing is the slowest mode as expected , so be patient . OUTPUT - paper comes out dry , text is rich and clean , looks like a laser printer . color is very sharp and crisp , no problems here . this unit does 8 1/2x11 borderless printing too , amazing . 5700x1440 dpi is very nice and durabrite ink comes out dry . SCANNING - it scans 1200x2400 dpi @ 48bit which in english means your color or b & w ; scans will come out exactly as the original , i scanned a magazine page and my keys , no blurs or distortion at all , job well done epson . COPYING - you dont need the pc to do copying , it does color and b & w ; copying just like a real copier would , enlargments / reductions / lighten or darken the image and zoom and # of copies , its all there . the scanning are is too small to handle legal size paper , but i dont think any of the multifunction printers can . CONCLUSION - i give it a 5 stars , the CX5200 had paper loading problems-fixed here , it also had slow photo printing-fixed here . This unit also displays the ink levels in printer config or control panel and ink is a * lot * cheaper and lasts longer than any of the HP mfc 's . DISLIKES - only things for epson to work on , makes the power cord removeable to the unit so its easier to feed under a desk , put the usb port in back of the unit so the cable doesn't get bent , make the control panel on the printer a little bigger , and maybe add a sleep mode so it will use less electricity when idle for 10 mins or more . There are tons of options to set in printer config , too many to explain here . Epson came out with this CX5400 model and the CX6400 model , personally , the CX6400 looked huge to me , 23 " wide and wouldn't fit on my desk . Still waiting for a review from zdnet or pcworld , wonder whats taking them so long ? CX5200 and CX5400 uses the same ink carts .. epson says black will last 1000 pages , and color around 300 pages give or take a few . I can tell you from experience , the HP2210 lasted 35 color pages and about 70 black . Good job Epson .. HP should be ashamed for charging twice the price for the same features and way overcharging for ink cartridges . I dont work for Epson , Amazon or HP , so you know this review is honest !  
2	  It was exactly as described and a excellent fix for the case I have . However it didn't have a manual with it or the I / O backplate for it ( had to order seperately ) .  
1	  Tried 2 unites with my Alcatel 1000 DSL modem w / SBC . Modem access is fine , and Netgears FVS318 router works fine . But 2 separtae WGT 624s I purchased cannot connect to the internet through the modem . Netgear 's support is slow and non responsive . They haven't fixed the router or refunded my money and they take 2-3 weeks between emails before responding at all , and when they do respond , it is with no soluction . I 've spend over 10 hours on this with nothing but headaches .  
2	  I have been dealing with extreme volume changes with TV here in Costa Rica . Commercials can make you jump from your chair and even station to station ranges are very varied . Last night I had the first enjoyable evening watching TV that I have had in years . I selected a level of volume that was pleasing / sufficient for me and everything came through at that volume . Terk VR1 Automatic TV Volume ControllerI wish I had looked for a product like this long before now .  
2	  The printer was extremely easy to set up . From out of the box to up and running took less than 5 minutes . Quality is nice , although the printer itself is rather large . Probably best to place under a desk rather than on it ..  
2	  The Notebook cooler is well designed to cool on either a lap or on a desktop . I had another cooler and it really wasn't designed well if you were actually using the computer on your lap . Here , there are two side vents for air intake ( not directly on the bottom ) so that if your holding your computer the airflow does not get interrupted . It 's also comfortable to hold and works equally well on a desk . The one thing I really dislike about the cooler is the bright blue LED light on the side to tell you that its on . Its just distracting . A small , dim light would serve the same purpose and not be distracting . Overall , however , a good product for the money .  
1	  I must have a headset to use a phone longer than a couple minutes due to a health issue and am one who reads reviews prior to purchase . I did so with this M220C and will be going through the hassle of exchanging it for something else after trying it out for a week . After figuring out that you could pull the plastic ear clip off and put in on the other way for the left ear I was able to get it on my ear with minimal difficulty . I called several friends and family and have used it for hours and the response on the sound quality from their end was very good . ( with switch set to high setting on unit ) When comparing the sound volume alone to another headset I have used it was low but tolerable if I turned the Panasonic cordless phone 's volume setting up to its highest setting . In general use I often found myself pushing the ear piece in closer to my ear canal to make sure I heard things more clearly and the kicker which sends it back is that as others have mentioned it really does pinch my normal size and shape ear with the clip / loop that holds it place . ( holds in place nicely I might add ) If the volume wasn't so low on the users end I might have just lived with it , but not with the pain on top of it . Off it will go .  
2	  Just got yesterday works good amazing price ordered 4 items from amazon to be delivered in three shipments . This item arrived first pretty quick for less than $ 3 shipping included . time will tell if it lasts but that 's true of anything will update review if i have problem .  
1	  The left speaker stopped working after 3 months . Get anything that isn't Labtec . Big waste of money .  
2	  One comment I need to make in regard to this unit is that there are basically 2 types of individuals who are interested in MP3 : The first is the person who 's primary interest is music - this is not the MP3 player you want . The second is the person who listens to talk shows or downloads podcasts and listens to it one time . This is the unit for you . I have only had this unit for a week now , and it does everything I want . I am not finding the user interface crude . It needs this functionality to deal with all the things it can do . It doesn't take very long to learn . I have mostly used this to listen to podcasts downloaded from the computer . I could listen to them either on this or a conventional MP3 player . I choose the Pogo LX because I can speed it up . It can play MP3 files at 1.3X and 1.5X and the pitch of the voice does not change . Voices don't sound like the chipmunks . I do wish it would retain this speed as it finishes one file and moves to the next ! I find navigation easy when I download files by putting them in directories that I know what they are . I is easy to navigate thru directories if you have this unit in the correct mode . Difficult to navigate if you don't . The built in speaker is useful , but not great sound quality . It is fine to listen to voice . Pathetic for music . For the intended audience , this unit is great !  
1	  I bought the Archos 2.0 . New . It did not work ; wouldn't turn on . Sent it in for repair ( Archos has no 1-800 number , which means a long wait on your dime ) . Returned the recorder , at my expense . Weeks and weeks passed-much longer than the 10 days Archos represented as the average turn-around time . When the recorder was returned , it was 10 , not a 20 . Archos returned a cheaper model . Called them up-same routine : 35-minute wait . Answer was , " We do not have any more 20 models . We can not send you a replacement . " If this type of service and product quality appeals to you , then by all means buy from Archos . On the other hand , if you want a recorder that works and has 3X longer battery life , buy a Sony .  
1	  When the UV Lens arrived , the seal had been cut on the original package and their were finger prints and smudges on product . Clean up was possible but this was clearly a used item .  
2	  This item is just as advertised . I have had the Kensington air / auto / ac charger for a little over a year and have used it extensivly . Recently the cord that plugeed into my laptop developed a short from rolling it up for travel . I was really glad to see this winder with the replacement cord . It works perfectly . The flat cord and wind up design eliminates the problem of winding the cord for packing . It also takes up less space as it winds up tighter than you woulld dare roll the standard cord . I highly recommend it . Kensington 33347 Travel Cable Winder for Kensington Power Adapters  
2	  I like this Camera for its ease of use . Good for amatures and for people like me who likes photography as a hobby . It does kind of short when it comes to some picture quality ( just a little bit ) . but dont get me wrong ! the photos are great , colors are lively ! but compare to DSLR - Digital Single Lens Reflex cameras with interchageable lenses this camera ( Z5 ) is a little bit short in photo quality . If you 're more of a Pro-hobbyist in photography this camera is not for you , better go for Nikon D50 or Canon Rebel XT . But for now , My DImage Z5 is all I need . The picture quality is close to my Nikon N6006 SLR Film Camera . It out performs my Nikon Coolpix 775 , HP Photosmart E317 5.0 MPixels & Vivitar 3.0 MP . Im kind of a little bit dissapointed because after a few months that I bought it the newer Model Z6 arrives with the same price tag . The Z5 has a better VGA Video ( 640 X 480 @ 15 or 30 fps ) than the Z6 ( 320 x 240 @ 15 or 30 fps . ) only . This is also one of the reason why I bought the Z5 , because of its video . There 's a lot of times that we want also to take video of let us say Family gatherings and we dont want to carry that bulky camcorder , well this is the solution to it . Oh by the way Z5 has 12X Optical zoom & 4X Digital zoom , If we compare the range with the ' old-fashioned ' 35mm camera it has a range of 35 - 420mm . With this kind of zooming power who needs an interchageable lenses ! and with my added telephoto lens my Z5 's zooming power is more than 12X ( 420 mm ) and with anti shake system this camera is awesome ! Z5 is a great Camera and Im enjoying it so far and I recently using it with the Wide angle and telephoto lenses : )  
1	  We bought the iLuv for our newborn 's nursery . I wanted something that had both a CD player and an iPod connection , preferably a docking connection for the iPod . The iLuv seemed perfect since it looked cool and wasn't quite as expensive as some other options . It also had Blutooth capabilities which I thought might prove useful . When I first opened the box , I have to admit I was a little disappointed . The material was more like " cheap alarm clock " rather than " audio equipment " . Yes , I recognize it wasn't a super high dollar item , but it wasn't cheap either , and I just thought it would be nicer . Though , I did like the " white on blue " LCD ( when it was working ) . Initially I tried using the iPod and it worked , but I found it a bit awkward for navigation . Being a docking station , you pretty much have to be in front of the iLuv to see the iPod screen . I just found that using the iPod dial was very awkward when not in my hand . Perhaps if the remote were full featured enough to navigate the iPod , I would still buy into the docking station . Without that , a corded solution would have been better . Speaking of the remote , it 's tiny and very cheap . It 's not backlit and the buttons are all the same shape ( circular " bubbles " ) so it 's very hard to use in the dark . The layout is poor as well , making it very difficult to use day or night . For whatever reason , we actually found we didn't use our iPods with it . Instead , we used CDs . Unfortunately it is VERY slow to load / read CDs . I also found that many CDs that worked fine in other CD players did not read right away in the iLuv . We would often eject and reinsert several times to get it to read . Sound failed to come out of it when it seemed like we should be hearing something so many times that we completely lost confidence in it . We should have done something during the warranty period , but it was just one of those things we tolerated . During the second year it got worse . We occasionally resorted to unplugging it and plugging it back in again to get it to work . It was at this point I contacted iLuv . I described our experience , explained that it was a fairly pricey item to fail within 2 years , but acknowledged it was out of warranty . I didn't expect much which is exactly what I got . They offered to fix it or replace it for about $ 50 , but I would be responsible for shipping it . I wasn't going to spend another dime on this product , so I declined their offer . Since then the LCD only displays in the lower half and occasionally we can't get any sound to come out of it even using the iPod mode . Pretty sad for something only 2 1/2 years old . When it works , the audio quality is fair . Not terrible , but nothing that blows me away . To be fair , I haven't really listened at higher volumes where it might make a difference . In retrospect , a cheap CD-player clock radio would have been a better choice for us . On several malfunctioning occasions I have bordered on just throwing it in the garbage . I hate that I wasted money on this and would never buy another iLuv product .  
1	  This is probably one of the WORST products I 've bought in a LONG time ! It should be something found in a dollar store - no joke ! PROS : - No batteries needed - Smaller than a bread boxCONS : - No volume ( earbuds laying on the table could produce as much sound ) - Much larger than it seems in pics - Dangerous to the delicate jack on your MP3 playerAfter reading many of the reviews on here where people complained about the low volume , I thought they probably just had high expectations . I went into it with very low expectations . I expected that this thing would not get any louder than the speaker on a cheap cell phone . However , this thing is SO LOW that my earbuds can produce as much sound from as far away . I can put this up against my ear at full volume and it 's still barely loud . I typically keep my volume restricted at about 75 % on my iPod . I had to unrestrict it and crank it up to 100 % to hear sound in a quiet room . Once you pass about the 80 % mark on an iPod , these speakers crackle ( but still don't give you enough sound ) . I am convinced that the company used the cheapest speakers they could find . I know that the speaker in my cell phone is about 10 times louder , eventhough it 's about 1/4 of the size of each of these two speakers . The size of this piece of junk is actually much larger than it appears in photos . It 's about 4.24 " w x 1.5 " d x . 75 " h . It could have very easily been about half of its size ( the housing is just a big empty cavity ) . The jack is mounted rigidly ( no swivel , etc . ) . So , it 's always sticking out and when plugged into your MP3 player , it will act as a huge lever , applying force that can easily break the solder points on your MP3 player 's audio jack . I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT ! All I wanted was to listen to podcasts through this thing with my iPod on the table right next to my keyboard - this isn't going to cut it , at all !  
2	  I installed this in one of my SUV 's that is not driven for weeks at a time . The Schumacher unit keeps a perfect charge and does not overheat or dry out the battery . The clock , radio , and GPS settings are all preserved and the charger does not seem to draw much power when the battery is charged . I am very satisfied with the operation of the unit . The installation was a breeze with the included hardware and the instructions were clear and easy . I do have two small complaints , however :( 1 ) The battery lugs were way too big for my vehicle and all other cars that I checked . ( 2 ) The AC plug is too short to run anywhere . I wanted the plug to reach to just outside the vehicle 's grill , so that the unit could be plugged in without opening the hood . I had to install an extra extension cord for that purpose .  
1	  I wish I would of done a bit of research on external hard drives before this purchase . My drive would not light or startup after 4 days of use . Don't take my word for it .. Just look at the hundreds of posts on forums and bogs regarding the " My Book " line of WD drives and you will see how widespread the issues / failures are . It 's ridiculous .  
1	  I bought this without much research as it was discounted at a closing store . It was super easy to install and worked fine for more then a year . As of recently though , it likes to just up and disappear whenever it wants to . It started when the computer would freeze or get shutdown improperly for some reason . When it was started back up , there 'd be no hard drive . I 'd unplug it and plug it back in and it popped back up fine . Soon though it did it more and more often even if the computer was shut down properly . Now it 's doing it whenever it feels like , and it doesn't just pop back up when I unplug it . It takes unplugging over and over , and restarting the computer over and over and endless attempts before it finally decides to come back . Then , I 'll open some program that pulls files from it , like iTunes as I have all my music on it , and all of a sudden it 's gone again . Right now I 'm trying to get all of our important stuff off of it because I no longer trust it at all . Beware this hard drive !  
1	  I saw some of the reviews discussing the melted Belkin ' rotating low profile plug ' , and figured it was a 1 in a million shot , so went ahead and bought one anyway . Mistake . I would not recommend buying any Belkin product with this rotating plug . Way too many people complaining about what must be a major safety issue . Plugs should not short out - period . I 've never in my 50 + years , had a plug short out and melt the plastic - pretty poor .  
1	  The wireless optical mouse blue worked great initially-for a full two weeks . All the prior reviews on how great the mouse is seem to come from the first two week period . After two weeks , however , the mouse began to move erraticly and jumped on the screen . The quality seemed to degrade as the batteries lost power . After a month the batteries completely died . After replacing them , the mouse continued to respond poorly . I tried to change channels and the mouse would not connect to the receiver . The pointer stopped moving completely and now the mouse is unusable . Don't buy this mouse .  
2	  Bought this flash for the Nikon D200 . The built-in flash is more than adequate for most closeup but for long distance this flash takes the cake .  
1	  The price was ok , but the cable sheath is brittle and cracks where it joins with the power connectors . SO its great for home use , but perhaps not for travellers  
2	  I researched for quite a while before selecting this camera and have been extremely pleased by its performance and options . The camera works perfectly as a " point and Shoot " or allows for manual overide for many settings . A good place to see technical specs is at .. I highly recommend that you also purchase the 128MB memory card that allows up to 1330 JPEG images at a 640 x 480 resolution and the Olympus CLA-1 41mm - 43mm lens tube adapter and an additional step up ring to accomodate a protective UV filter ( otherwise the lens at full telephoto will bump into the filter ) and a larger lens cap . The USB feature makes downloading the pictures a cinch . If you can afford it , consider moving up ( in price ) to the discontinued model 3000 ( I think ) that includes a built in microphone that allows up to 4 sec of audio with each picture ! Its the only feature I believe that would make this camera better .  
2	  If you want to network your computers to share files and surf the net .. If you don't have much time and money .. If you 're afraid to ask your geek friends for help , then this product is for you ! I purchased this device around November of 2000 , despite my super-geeky friend mocking me and putting me down and criticizing my " foolish purchase " . I would say this is my only time I 'm ever right , and I 've been using the Linksys ever since . Why change proxy server software every few months and / or face constant upgrades ( not to mention the time spent ) . Why keep the " proxy server / internet " computer on 24/7 ? With this Linksys you only pay for the device and hook up to as many computers as you like ( without licensing restrictions ) . You can turn on / off any computer as you please , it won't affect the internet sharing . Plug in a printer with a built-in network card and you 've got a dedicated network printer . What genius ! Great for protecting your computer against outside attackers with a built-in firewall protection . Easy to use and configure with the browser . If you got broadband , don't [ pay ] extra for each computer hook-up . The secret is to get one connection and share it all Through Your Linksys Router . ( be wary though some ISPs don't give support for LAN setups ) Sure I should use wireless .. Sure I 've gotten spoiled using this device rather than learning how to setup a DHCP / NAT / proxy server and firewall , but who cares ? As long as it works , it works . If it ain't broke why fix it ? I give this product a 5 star rating ! * * * * *  
1	  Sucks . Really really sucks . This is why I didn't want to spend more than 5 bucks on a pair of earbuds . Better to buy something cheap and when it stops working , throw it out and buy another cheap set . I got to thinking , however , that maybe I should invest in something of a higher quality and stop making that trip to the dollar store to pick up headphones . So I bought these .. and loved them . The sound is top notch . And I can blast my music without my neighbor on the train or bus being any the wiser as to what I 'm listening . Sigh .. then one day the left ear piece just stopped working . I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary . Just standing on the bus when all of a sudden it just went out . I then looked at the reviews and , low and behold , I 'm not the only one that 's gone through this . So here I am .. with these expensive buds .. that don't really work . So now I have to deal with Monster directly to try and get a refurbed unit which is basically another broken set of headphones . I 'd advise you to look elsewhere . Seems like there 's some sort of build malfunction that causes this as , again , I 'm not the only one .  
2	  I felt compelled to write a review of the Orbit Optical after reading some of the negative comments . It has been an excellent product . Very dependable for many years . As for the ball " jumping " out it hasn't happened to me in all the years I 've had this one and I have never noticed a " dead spot " during use . Regarding " no scrolling " complaints , the Kensington Mouseworks software , when installed , does have a scroll feature that is activated by " chording " the left and right buttons . I got the Orbit Optical as a warranty replacement from Kensington for an older mechanical model that wore out . Great warranty support . I do a lot of CAD and graphics work and my hand is comfortable all the time . No chasing the mouse around the desktop . I do admit I use a Fellowes mouse pad with a built in wrist rest for more comfort and it keeps the Orbit from sliding around . My wife liked mine so much she ordered one for her Mac ( now she has two buttons that work ! ) .  
2	  Had just purchased an HD receiver for Satellite TV . Discovered they wanted $ 5 a month for each additional receiver so we could have reception all over the house ( we had 3 additional sets with no service ) My son was going to try to " split " the wires like we did for the regular satellite box and then we saw this in Best Buy . Decided we could get it cheaper online and sure enough we did ! Works like a charm and as long as we can all agree on what to watch we have NO problems ! So much cheaper and reception is usually clear and could not ask for a better option !  
1	  If you 're not prone to getting dirty , and aren't particularly hard on your gear , this is a " fine " holster . Quick retrieval of your eTrex will usually end up tearing the holster off your belt ( and ruining your belt ) repeatedly , as it 's too snug for the eTex and the beltclip has no backgrip . The velcro fastener is easy to gum up by falling in a stream or a bit of mud / dirt , and then it 's just flapping around useless - which then you " understand " why the holster keeps a death grip on your eTrex .  
2	  I was really surprised when I first looked at the GR-DVD815 Camcorder I purchased from Gondarbook through Amazon . com . This thing is Clean ! They said " Like New " , & they weren't lying . I 'd swear it had never been used . Not a scratch ! As for video quality , I played it back over my TV & was surprised again . Even though its not HD , it could almost pass for it . I usually don't have this much luck on a used purchase so I 'm kinda waitin ' for the other shoe to fall but for right now I 'm VERY pleased with my purchase , Length of delivery ( 7 days ) , & everything to do with this Great little Camcorder ! 5 stars all the way !  
1	  I received this item June 19 , 2011 . The setup was easy and the signal was great on all 4 channels . Yesterday , August 5 , it stopped working altogether . The signal broke up pretty badly for a couple of minutes and then it quit . No signal on any channel and no amount of adjustment brought helped in any way . Of course it is about 2 weeks past the return window with amazon . I have requested a refund anyway and we 'll see if amazon supports their customers . A $ 102.00 piece of electronic equipment should not be dead after a month of use . Save your money . Edited to add that amazon quickly agreed to make an exception to their return policy under the circumstances . So although the product I received is clearly defective , kudos to amazon for their professionalism .  
2	  I was lucky to buy this on the sale rack at a discount store , so perhaps I 'm happy with the value I got for little $ , but I had another player before this , an off-brand , and the sound was terrible . I have not heard other players , but I am thrilled with the sound on the ibeat sweez . It also gets very good fm reception . It weighs nothing ; it 's about the size of a 5-piece pack of gum . If you are far-sighted ( need glasses to read ) you may not be happy with the text size on the very small display . I 'm near-sighted and have no problem with it ; it 's clear and an easy-to-read font . The menu is a bit labor-intensive to get through , however , my experience with other players is about nil so I wouldn't know how it compares . My biggest problem occurred with switching from fm to mp3 . This takes some practice as you have to follow a series of particular and somewhat illogical steps ; this is likely not for those without any tech savvy . It took me a while to figure it out and then only after reading the instructions over several times and even asking their customer service people to explain it . But I finally learned it and now have no problems . I 've had the player for over two years and use it often . I am attached to it and hope it keeps working . Unfortunately I have only a 2gb , wish it were larger capacity , but that 's not the player 's fault . The sound quality would keep me coming back to Ibeat if they make players cheaper than Apple 's .  
2	  I was having problems reading SDHC Cards on my SD readers , but no problem using my camera . So I scoured all the sites for a good deal on SDHC readers . I was dumbfounded about the inexpensive price that included the Extreme II cards . I have purchased two 2GB Extreme II cards that are great . I can take 3 shots / second with this card . Incredible stop action pics for tennis and football . The card reader is smaller than my old one I loved , what a plus . It takes the SDHC without a hitch . It comes with a groovy holder that protects the reader and card . This one is definitely a photographer 's friend . I wholeheartedly recommend this combo and I would like to thank everyone that has written reviews on Amazon because I come here first .  
2	  a little daunting at first , but easy to use , very accurate and so far long battery life . would definitely recommend it .  
2	  All around AWESOME product , This headset along with my HD Audio driver and software provided with me new Zotac 8100 chipset , makes this headset an AWESOME addition to gaming quality ! Makes you feel like your in the war ! ( Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 ) I also use it for playing World Of Warcraft on ventrilo as well and people say they can hear me clearly with no static or voice break ups . I rate this product from Microsoft 5 STARS . Easy setup , easily compatible with HD Audio drivers , Giving HD gaming go to a whole new level of performance ! Very impressed with this headset . The headset it self is rather large so it fits completely over my ears , ( unlike previous headsets that sit on top of your ears ) so this makes it so your ears WONT HURT after a few hours of use ! Any other head set I used made my ears red and hurt after an hour , these are comfortable as it gets ! THANK YOU MICROSOFT ! A + 5 Respectful Stars ! - Jay  
2	  I have a couple nylon softer-sided cases . Because the sides are stiffer and bubbled out a little bit on this one , I think this one will provide a little more protection when banging around behind the seat of the car . The item I received doesn't have a handle like the one in the picture ; I 'm fine with that , but it 's worth noting .  
2	  I have been using the Sennheiser HD-497 headphones for over 6 months . I am extremely satisfied w / my purchase . I have used these headphones for stereo use , portable CD use , and on my computer . They have never disappointed me yet . All types of music , from jazz , rock , metal , rap , to classical , sounds excellent through these headphones . They drive bass quite well for inexpensive headphones ! They are very lightweight , too . And , despite some other reviewers remarking on lack of comfort , I find the headphones to be extremely comfortable for long periods of wear . They are attractive phones w / exceptional design , build and price . Thus , I would rate them a best buy .  
2	  This is the best FM transmitter I 've purchased . I own two others that were not IPOD exclusive and they are trash . They are too bulky and have wires everywere , which make my car look messy . The XtremeMac is slim and looks like it belongs on the IPOD . If you own an IPOD and need an FM transmitter this is you best bet .  
1	  I would completely agree with the other review that states the DVI port is the only HD port on this TV and it doesn't support HDCP ( New Security for HD content ) . I bought this TV when it first came out thinking it would be useable when more HD content was available .. WRONG ! I just updated my receiver and DVD player and connected them with an HDMI to DVI-D cable thinking I was set for HD . The entire time I was setting up my new receiver and DVD player I was patting myself on the back for having the foresite to buy an HD ready TV . After getting everything setup I get NO picture on this TV and an HDCP error on the receiver because the TV doesn't have the $ % # $ * & $ HDCP security . This was just another $ 5K wasted on technology that isn't supported by the industry or Philips . I just can't believe they are still able to market this TV as HD-Ready when it is quite obvious that HDCP security is going to be required for any device receiving HD content . Also , they are making sure that it 's illegal to provide any kind of adapter in the U.S. that allows the security to be bypassed and older devices ( 3 years or less included ) to be used with the new equipment . Do your homework before you waste this kind of money on a TV.I now have the most expensive computer monitor known to man , which will work until Microsoft finishes their version of HDCP for computers ( Longbow ) and makes it completly obsolete . I am just amazed at the complete lack of knowledge displayed by the so called " expert " reviewers on the Internet and in the stores who seem completely uneducated about this very real easily reproducable issue .  
1	  The volume wheel of my Rio Carbon broke few days after the warranty period ( 90 days ) and the Rio customer service does not care about it . I do not recommend this player especially due to the poor customer service . I bought my Rio Carbon for $ 249.99 four months ago . Its price dropped down to less than $ 179.99 ! . It is pretty easy to guess why ?  
1	  For all the good things that have been said and written about these headphones , if you can't tolerate how they FEEL on your ears , the sound quality is worthless . Try them on for several hours-then decide . I planned to use these to replace BOSE 1 's ( stolen from luggage cart ) and 2's-left behind on the plane , and swiftly gone . After trying them on a trans-con flight last week , I actually had to remove the ATs and switch to the airline 's cheepos to survive to the end of the movie . I wrote to Audio-Technica about the problem-mainly the stitching and rough inner fabric that irritate the ears , at least MY ears . They replied promptly and constructively , but had no fix for the problem and suggested I return them to the retailer . ( Unfortunately for me , the retailer 's 14-day return period is over . )  
1	  Doesn't work and it cost more to send back then its worth , So I am stuck with it .  
2	  installing these in a car I need them to be rugged as I have to snake the darn things around seats , behind protective plates , under carpets , etc . They held up to whatever pulling and dragging that had to be done without a scratch . 2nd they need to really isolate ground loop noise , esp . in a noisy car like these Honda products with their pumped up ignition system . They did that well and delivered a clean music source as promised , while not breaking the bank . I will definitely consider getting these again . BTW , 12 feet was just enough to reach from a top of trunk amp . mount , to the side of trunk , down back of seat corner to floor , under carpet and up behind the dash structure with just enough left for a comfortable connect to the head unit . After using this for a while , I did notice there is a mild alternator whine but only at night with the headlights on . I was able to clear it up by putting in magnetic decouplers which you can easily find at your nearest RS . Separating the run of the interconnect from the power didn't seem to help . Ground loop noise like that is probably everywhere .  
2	  PictureMate Deluxe Viewer Edition takes the personal photo lab one step further , making it even easier to view , edit and print glossy 4 " x 6 " photos . It measure 6 by 10 by 6 inches ( HWD ) , weighs 5.5 pounds , and has a handle . The Deluxe Viewer Edition also has a battery option . Setup is just as easy as with the original . Simply slide the single six-color ink cartridge-with cyan , yellow , magenta , black , red , and blue inks-into the slot in the back , load the photo paper , connect the power cord , and you 're ready to print from a camera , external CD or ZIP drive , a USB memory key , or any type of memory card , although you 'll need an adapter for miniSD cards and some Memory Stick formats . To print from your computer , the only additional steps are to connect by USB cable and run the automated install program . You can also add Epson 's optional Bluetooth adapter for wireless printing . It takes about 1 minute 19 seconds to 1:45 for each photo , whether printed from a computer , memory card , or camera . It uses ink and paper , which means the photos for the Deluxe Viewer Edition are also waterproof and smear-proof even immediately after printing , and they cost only 29 cents per print . Now this is the kicker , it is cheaper to print them at Sam 's Club for 12 cents per print , so I only purchased this because I can take it to scrap meets and print what I need when I need it . My other photos I send to Sam 's Club or even Wal-Mart for nearly the same price of 12 cents . This is more of a convince thing for me . I purchased this mode for only 24.99 at Target where it normally retailed for 199.00 but it was on super clearance . This is what you have to weigh in on , convince for the price or what your pocket book can handle . It has come in handy for me at times and the prints come out nicely so it is a tossup for people on a budget !  
1	  i could'not use it in my computer . i lost the money , $ 50.00 . can i receive help to sell it .  
1	  Despite the many reviews stating the poor quality of the product I thought I 'd give it a go based on the few reviews in its favor . I should have listened .. and you should too . The converter is worthless , but if you 're wanting to spend a bit more just for the adaptors go for it , but I 'd look elsewhere . After merely turning on the electrical device the converted popped , smoked and was no longer effective .. or rather , was NEVER affective .  
2	  Had to modify this baby a bit , drive would shake in its housing , problem solved by placing a small piece of Styrofoam in the back now drive sits snug in its casing . Love it so far .  
2	  Overall good product with good Video and audio quality . However updating the movie list is slow and cumbersome . There is no extermal connection ( USB or Ethernet ) to download the movie list , etc ..  
1	  You 'll notice a pattern to these reviews : they tend to be either 5 stars ( " I have no IT background , and even I got it to work in 2 minutes ! " ) or 1 star ( " I have years of experience , and not even sacrificing a goat helped ! " ) . I fall into the latter . Which is true ? Both , probably . Yes , I fully believe that there are those out there who got this working with XP in under 2 minutes . But trust me when I say that , using the very latest drivers ( downloaded from the Netgear site , Nov . 2002 ) , and spending several hours on the phone with Netgear support , on more than one occasion , I have not gotten this thing to work properly . ( I have tried exchanging the card in case it was hardware related . ) Windows 98 had the problem of being very unhappy about having more than 4 TCP / IP devices ( this card , internal ethernet card , internal modem X 3 [ 1 for the modem , 1 each for the modem with the MSN and AOL # ' s pre-loaded , the latter two I had forgotten about ] , and yes , that is a known " issue " with Windows 98 ) . So , that prompted me to get Windows 98 replaced with XP . Windows XP refused to read the driver off the CD , refused to read the driver from file , and basically had to be force fed the driver , which then didn't work . Deleting the driver to try over from scratch , XP now refuses to believe the card even exists , let alone needs a driver . After talking to many people with various wireless cards and various machines , I keep hearing the same story over and over again . Depending upon * what specific machine * you have running XP , and what card you use , things either tend to work immediately , or not at all , with it being a crap shoot as to which it is going to be . So , yes , with XP this card * might * work immediately . But it also might not , and Netgear technical support won't be very helpful in making it work for you . So , you 'll either end up in the 5 star or 1 star category , and unless you have a friend with an * identical * set-up , good luck guessing which it will be . Best advice seems to be : go ahead and try it . If it works immediately , enjoy it . If not , return it and try again with another brand , and hope for better luck . Feb . 2003 Update : True to the above , I downloaded Driver Version 2.6 ( Dec . 2003 ) , and it * still * doesn't work , although another person I know ( who 's card hasn't worked for the past year ) did just update the firmware and driver on his MA401 , and it worked for him on XP . I gave my MA401 card to a friend with XP , and it worked immediately on his machine . Lest you think somehow it is me or my machine , I just tried a Linksys WMP11 ( version 3 , I hear < version 2.5 is not as reliable ) , and that worked immediately ! As I said , it seems to be very , very hit or miss on machines running in XP , and I go with my original advice . Try it , and if it doesn't work quickly , move on to the next brand .  
1	  The Nike is not compatible with the 1GB nano shuffle . This should be included in the advertisement .  
1	  I purchased this item after carefully reading all the other reviews . I , like others , cound not get it to work with wireless security turned on . I even tired using the " tricks " described in another review . To be fair , the product worked fine without wireless security , but I see little point in helping my neighbors tap my internet connection . I am very disappointed in the product .  
2	  the extension adapter is kind of annoying , but completely necessary if you want it to even reach your jacket pocket . otherwise these phones excel in noise cancellation and have strong audio qualities / attributes .  
2	  Lens was all I had hoped for , performed great when just shooting hand held on solid land or when bobbing around in a kayak . Excellent wild-life and scenery shots under varying conditions and distances .  
2	  This is a handy tool . It is pretty compact ( not much larger than a highlighter / magic marker ) , has a built in clip ( so you can securly place it in hip or breastpocket ) . And it does a great job of removing incidental finger and water smudges from your precvious lens with an extruded endpiece that looks to be covered with some microfiber material . And you simply " erase " the marks . Simple as that . It also comes with a retractable brush that can be used to quicky wisk off any dust particles around the edges or creases of the camera / lens . Highly recommneded to anyone with a camera to keep that lens clean and producing the best shots you are capable of .  
1	  Beginning on day 1 , the player made a loud noise whenever in use . After 6 weeks ( and no more than a dozen dvd viewings ) , it stopped working all together .. whenever I put in a DVD it powers off . Not worth the cost of sending it back ; a total waste of money .  
2	  Good quality backpack but a bit tight for use with a 17 inch notebook .. at least my HP 17 " notebook . But with a bit of pushing and shoving , it does fit .  
1	  No difference compared to another good cable costing 1/2 as much . Don't believe me - buy and then return it , or just save yourselfthe trouble . Monster preys on perfectionists . Those peoplegiving such great reviews don't know the difference betweenan ohm and plastic .  
2	  Great way to transfer images and is really easy and fast . No cords no mess , highly recomend with any digital camera !  
1	  I had high hopes for this product but never got to try it as it would not read my xD card as promised . Be careful ordering this frame as it is impossible to return .  
2	  Put your laptop screen on TV . watch movies on larger screen . Your laptop can be a portable DVD player when traveling . Great item .  
2	  First of all .. I started out with pocket pc .. and now also have a palm . I first recieved a HP Jornada 548 with a keyboard for graduation and loved it .. then i ordered a computer from dell and got the m100 free . Although it doesnt have color ( which is kindof overrated ) and no headphone jack , and no mp3 player .. my only complaint is that it only has 2 MB ram .. ! The truth about palm os is that it is " elegantly simple " . The main difference between a Pocket PC and Palm OS is that Pocket PC is like carrying around a little computer .. ( and the burdens that are associated with computers .. ie crashing , sometimes overwhelming when you just want to do simple tasks ) with low battery life and much weight .. however palm os is like just what you NEED to play mind occupying games , calendar , alarms notes and all the necessary stuff in a smaller package , lighter weight .. easy to read in all light screen and it is very productive because it doesnt have too much computer b . s . just a piece of electronic equippment that that helps keep you organized , and occupied when necessary . ULTIMATELY : I recommend that everyone in this world own both a pocket pc ( for portable computer<i have a laptop too & gt ;) , and a palm os device with 8MB RAM not 2 ( for ultimate portability and productivity for normal tasks . ) PS this would have had 5 stars if it had 8MB of ram .. < Hello handspring visor delux )  
2	  I 've been working on a 365 photo project since February of 2009 and I found myself encountering difficult shooting challenges . For those of you not familiar with 365 shots , the goal is to take a self-portrait of sorts every day for a year . The shots can be part of your body , face , finger , shadow , etc depending on who 's rules you follow . Anyhow , arm 's length self portraits and perfectly synchronized self-timer shots get really old really fast . This remote was just what I needed ! I shoot with a D80 and the 18-200VR lens . The shutter release offers me so much more freedom with my shots . I especially like the timer delay release when I push the trigger and it goes off seconds later , not sure if that is unique to my camera ) . This gives me the opportunity to point the remote at the camera and then stash the remote out of view . Shutter release time is pretty speedy when I push the remote buttom . Sometimes I have trouble juggling the focusing process when using the remote . I can pre-focus by depressing the shutter release halfway or adjusting the manual focus and then firing the shot with my remote . As far as I can tell , the remote will not initiate the auto-focus mechanism on its own , too bad . This can be troublesome with self portraits when I am the subject that I 'd like my camera to focus on . I also I wish the remote did not have to NOT have to be in a direct line of sight with the sensor . Sometimes my long lens gets in the way . Overall , I have been extremely pleased with this product and I would recommend it to all my friend with compatible cameras . It is small , lightweight and very easy to use . It has vastly expanded my composition opportunities . I even at times will hold the camera in one hand ( in some precarious way that doesn't allow me to press the shutter release directly ) so then I fire the shot with the remote . It works like a dream . PROS : small , lightweight , easy to set-up and use , decent response timeCONS : needs direct line of sight to fire the shutter , focus is only possible from the camera body itself and not the remote  
1	  It 's the second one I bought today .. the first one froze when I was trying to do my first donwload .. went back to Circuit City and got another one .. the second one was even worse .. never turned on ! Tomorrow I 'll go back to get an IPOD !  
1	  pros , none . Cons : everything . purchased 0709 . after four months and roughly 30 hours on the fone and time spent unhooking various configurations I was told to box it up and pay to have it sent back . had to give them my credit card so they could charge me in case they never got it . a week later i get replacement . it looked like it had been thrown off a skyscraper and drug for miles behind a car . they said , oh , it has been over 3 months we only send refurbished units . can i talk to a supervisor . no ! finally a month later i decide to hook it up . no instructions . on the fone . later , i try to hook it up , CD won't work . on the fone for 45 minutes while i try to decipher her english . is wireless working . yes . I hang up , wireless goes down . next day , on the fone , ok , do this and that and blah . well , before it was dropping connections every few minutes . now , i can go sometimes 30 mins and not get dropped . it is slow , very , very , very slow just to connect to a standard web page . and , the router is direct line of sight four feet from my laptop . junk .  
2	  Although I think it might be a little expensive for what it is , I 'm still happy . Works perfect with my Nikon D40 . I have found that you need to connect the camera via USB cord . It doesn't work with a card reader like I thought it might . No big deal . Downloaded 2.5 GB of RAW files to my 5.5 generation 80GB ipod last weekend without a problem .  
2	  The Belkin PureAV 16-gauge speaker wire is a good gauge speaker wire comparable to Monster for moderate lengths . Unfortunately there are no instructions on the packaging demonstrating how to install supplied pins-none are available at website either . You will need a very small Hex-wrench to undo the screws under the red and black covers . Twist the speaker wire and insert into pins , then retighten the screws . The pins will stay on tight .  
1	  Poor quality cable . Worked great at beginning but stop functioning after 1 month . Don't waste your money .  
2	  I bought this headset way back in January of 2011 . I used it for my PC / PS3 gaming & General use . It 's sound is pretty good ; I can hear a lot more detail when I use them . The mic part itself is also pretty good . While talking with friends over Skype they 'd say that there was no static and my voice was clear . This headset is also comfortable . However , your ears may get sore after a long period of time ( 5 hours + ) . It wasn't really great at stopping background noise , but it wasn't the worst either . I liked the mute button on the cord , I used this daily . If i had to talk to my family , I 'd just mute it without having to leave my game or mute it on my computer . Overall I 'd recommend this headset to casual gamers or for general use . Such as using skype and all that . Edit : I also forgot to add that this headset recently stopped working ; or at least the mic part did . Still , I got 2 years of use out of it .  
1	  I have experience with installing dish systems and outdoor antenna systems . This antenna is a joke . Good only if you live very close ( 10-15 miles ) and have a clear line to the tower . Off axis signals and trees or other obstructions render it useless and inconsistent . A weak or inconsistent signal in the digital system than it was in the analog system . It looks cool but a bow tie antenna using coat hangers I made myself did a much better job . Save your money for a good antennae and pass this one by .  
1	  As had been plainly mentioned before in an earlier review ( which I misinterpreted when buying it ) , there is a caveat to this product , as confirmed by this unedited quote from D-Link 's own Tech Support website : " Note : The only Access Point the DWL-2000AP can be a Wireless Client to is another DWL-2000AP . " This means that it CANNOT be configured as a Wireless Client with your existing Wireless Router , even if your router is D-Link 's own ! It can only be used in this mode if , for example , you have directly connected a DWL-2000AP into your existing router to serve as your network 's Wireless Access Point . Then , and ONLY then , you can buy a 2nd DWL-2000AP and use it as a Wireless Client . This fact is not advertised in the device 's technical data page here , nor was it even specified on the box it came in ( thus my 2-star rating , mostly for false advertising ) . So beware this glaring shortcoming . If you 're looking for a simple , flexible , single wireless-G client to jack your Ethernet card-equipped device into , try a Linksys WGA54G . It is advertised as a game console adapter , but it actually works great as a basic wireless client for ANY Ethernet device , not just game consoles . I have one working quite well in this role elsewhere in my home using WEP , and will now be buying more of them .  
1	  Mine is going back . I can not get it to work . The documentation is useless , and the media server does not work worth a damn . Over an hour on customer support and no one there seems to know how to trouble shoot the device . Control your blood pressuse , Avoid this product !  
1	  After reading reviews for these headphones , I was highly anticipating receiving mine . I am a very active person , and use headphones daily when going on runs , lifting in the weight room etc . Sadly , these headphones are only good for running , nothing else . They are incredibly uncomfortable after about 20 minutes of use , and can not be worn when laying back on machines for workouts like bench press , incline , decline , etc . The one redeeming factor that I will say about these headphones is the sound quality ; which I believe is majorly attributed to the fact that the construction of the headphones forces the earpieces so far into your ear . Had to return these the next day ..  
1	  Was $ 50 , but on sale for $ 27 . Picture quality was terrible ; couldn't even make out faces on the other end ( Skype ) . Bought a Logitech for $ 87 and love it !  
1	  I will first start by saying that I have not installed or tried this product yet . I received the product and am giving it 1 star for what I consider false advertisement . No where in the description does it state that this is a remanufactured product . The picture and description makes it appear that it is their own brand . That is the reason I decided to purchase this product . Receiving a catridge that looks nothing like the picture and is stamped in large letters " Remanufactured " was a big let down as I felt I was duped . If you are going to sell a remanufactured product the PLEASE STATE SO ! I do not appreciate the bate and switch tactics of this company . Once I install it and use it I will post a description of its capabilities but until I run out of ink I have no need to do so . I just do not like being sold something and then receiving something totally different .  
2	  Spent a lot of time researching these docks , i required one with am / fm and the ipod hook up . Pros : - Good Sound-Compact body design , will be easy to travel with-Every kind of snap in attachment to fit any ipod size , even Gen 5Cons : - only one , you can't change albums from the unit or the remote , you need to do so from the ipod directly . Not a problem if you have playlists already setup , but if youare like me and jump from artist / album to another , you have to be near the unit .  
1	  Just recently got a U150 error : " Cartridge not recognized by printer " This follows on the heels of error indicating that I had two of the same print cartridges in the machine several months ago . I have never bought anything but genuine Canon ink . So , maybe there is a defect in the cartridge and the little " keep the user only buying from us " chip . BUT , all I wanted to do was scan an item , NOT PRINT . However the people who designed the software for this thing in their infinite wisdom chose to DISABLE ALL FUNCTIONS if all cartridges are not in the printer , filled with ink and recognizable . So you must at all times keep backups of ALL cartridges in case of the day when your cartridges become unrecognizable to the machine even though the are the correct cartridge in the correct position and filled with ink . You cannot scan or fax without a full complement of cartridges . Maybe the next version will work in a sane logical manner and allow non-printing related functions to work . Until that day I will not be buying another Canon printer . The reason for buying a multifunction printer is so that each function can work independently and not be dependent on the ink supply .  
2	  Battery stays charge for quite some time and charges up fast . Serves its purpose ! Always safer to go with official microsoft products .  
1	  Could not get it to work soo I sent it back . I had it for a month and talked to the Teck 's 5 or 6 times and they could never get all the buttons to work . Would not reccomend it .  
2	  I bought this over 1/2 year ago & it still looks like new , even with almost daily use . Construction is sturdy & compact-the perfect size for any earbuds . As quality a product as Jlab 's Jbud 's , which also work flawlessly after a 1/2 year of tugs , pulls & usage .  
2	  I bought this sub with matching soundbar as a replacement to my 6 speaker surround sound unit . The new setup is soo sweet ! The sound bar rocks and this sub packs a huge punch ! My living room is small , but I guarantee this sub could live up to larger expectations . Great price and a highly recommended add-on to the sound bar .  
2	  I absolutely love this card ! Its price can't be beat and it provides a reliable Internet connection . It works flawlessly ( and on the first connection attempt to ! ) with WPA . It gets lightning fast signal from my router that is on the other side of my house . I couldn't ask for more in terms of performance and value . BTW , the drivers included on the CD will get the card up and running .. but download the newest drivers from the manufacturer 's website . Those new drivers make all the difference : It greatly increases the signal strength and connection speed . In addition , the physical PCI card is very low profile . It sits right next to my video card on my motherboard and doesn't affect airflow from the GPU cooling fan . If you 're looking for a reliable wireless card , look no further !  
1	  This camera was good for 3 months . I had taken it to LA last week and took a few snaps at the beach . I did NOT drop it in the water or anywhere else . After some time I started hearing clicking noises and after that there was a louder noise along with a burning smell . Maybe the other review about moisture affecting the camera is true . It would be pathetic if you can't take pictures on the beach or near the pool etc .  
2	  I got this TV yesterday , and let me say , it is perfect , i got it from circuit city for $ 550 . Was looking at the 27 ' Olevia version , but this caught my eye . The picture quality isnt great without an HD subscription , but it is still good . It has everything you need unless youre into more technical TVs . Menu is fantastic ( short and sweet ) . So far my XBox360 looks like bliss hooked up to it . All i need is a HDMI cable ( cablesforless . com ) and im set ! One tiny winy little thing is that when it is off the blue LED light lights up the bedroom so i turn it off from the back , but its perfect . I havent had any problems with it like the other reviews here . It comes with a 1yr warranty already so i didnt get a 3yr deal . I say if you 've done a lot of research and are on the edge , buy it , if you want excellent picture quality , make sure you have a HD subcription for HD channels !  
1	  I got mine less than a month ago . I bought it because I read other reviews and I thought it would be the perfect complement for my SET610 . First two weeks , great wonderful . Then something happened . From time to time my computer said " bluetooth device not found " . I guess it overheated or something , because I unplugged it for about 15 minutes and plugged it back again , and it worked fine again . It was annoying . Now this weekend it suddenly stopped working at all . It was a major disappointment . I 'm sending it back . I guess it 's not a bad product . I was just unlucky , but I 'll choose another one . Trend brand lost a customer .  
2	  I needed an inexpensive set of speakers to use with my MP3 player . I saw these Maxell 's and figured I couldn't go wrong considering the price . I received them , hooked them up and they blew me away . For under 20 bucks I could not believe how good they sound . The flat panel speakers take up very little room on my shelf , the speakers have crisps highs , very good midrange . Voices sound as good as on my expensive big speakers . The little woofer adds a nice bottom end and is really decent considering the size . There 's a wired remote that works OK . The speaker wire is a little cheesy , woofer enclosure pretty lightweight but afer looking a others in this range they are no better . I like these so much I 'm getting a 2nd set for my computer .  
2	  those headphones are inexpensive and fits OVER the ear so it doesnt hurt to wear them for long periods of time . Bass is ok and sounds are crisp but for some reason the volume always seem to be alittle lower then the setting  
2	  I looked long and hard for a protective case for my Macbook that I could use in a backpack or other bag . I couldn't be happier with this sleeve . Fits the Macbook perfectly and has just the right amount of padding . Also the zipper is protected all the way around on the inside to prevent scratches . This is exactly what I was looking for and would recommend it for anyone who 's looking for a protective case , not a full blown bag .  
1	  I bought these seemingly " premium " type headphones to replace my cheap Sony headphones which also had a hook . I 've never been able to run with the Apple earbuds . They just don't stay in my ears . Anyway , I 'm definitely just going to buy another pair of the cheap Sony headphones because the Nike Vapors don't stay in my ears at all . Maybe my ears are too small , but they bounce right out even when walking . Basically , they 're terrible .  
2	  DurabilityThe Corsair engineering people really put a whole lot of thought into building their flash drives to last , as if they actually use them out in the real world of public libraries and other public internet access sites , where klutzes walking by tend to snap the head right off your other brand name flash drive . These here are built to last , and with a ten year warrantee it is no sweat , baby ! Relax ! Forget about it ! Just get her done ! It is truly shock proof , with soft rubber around it in a nice teal color . There is really no reason at all for not being able to fully engage this flash drive into any USB port , unless it is already squeezed with other neighboring peripherals , in which case you need to move some connections anyway . The plug is long , and solid and strong and built to last . Durable . And just in case , comes freely included a long USB extension cable , really nice , which can also be useful for your SD CARD readers and other things a little wider than usual when you absolutely cannot make space for them . Plus the excellent cloth lanyard extra wide and with a heavy duty smooth clasp . Corsair does not play around when it comes to durability and usefulness , and a guarantee . Just look at their Survivor series ! This four gig voyager unit is an excellent negotiated compromise with your bank account . It is not the eight gig , it is not the survivor , but it will last ten years , guaranteed , in the real world . Take that long just to fill it up ~ ! I am a photographer and a small photo file is two meg , so this flash drive is just what I need to transfer files . Glad to have it . It also includes some built in software for file transfer but don't worry about it . It comes fully documented . I have no idea what those one star reviews are whining about . This is a great strong unit , and exactly what I was looking for and lives up to all of its promises and more .  
1	  I 've had these in my ears for under 10 minutes , and they 've already fallen out three or four times . I should mention that I am sitting in a chair and not moving . Sound quality is sub-par , although for $ 2 I wasn't expecting greatness ( and I 'm sure I would eventually get used to it ) . I was hoping to have these as a cheap backup , but they 're almost unusable . Try something else .  
2	  Pros : Good angle of view . Good quality video . Good quality alloy body . Works flawlessly with Kenwood DNX7100 DVD navigation receiver . Cons : Camera must be mounted high so make sure your can mount it ( you may have to drill holes in your car ) Overall : Good product and reasonable price .  
2	  I bought S20 to photograph my kid last year and I have not thought of changing to any other camera . The only problem it has , besides expensive print , is the battery life . I did not have time to do research on it so I kept buying 2CR5 batteries from Walgreen , which were like 12 bucks per piece . Until very recently I suddenly woke up figuring I needed to buy rechargeable battery to prevent those expensive one-time 2CR5 batteries from draining my pocket . DK110 ( the power supply which include the charger and the rechargeable NB-5H battery ) is an absolutely must-buy for Canon S20 users - go get it right after you bought ur camera . Of course the camera will be heavier with NB-5H but it 's not much difference . I have done this a year late but it will easily pay off in a couple of months for me . And also I would strongly suggest you buy an adapter for your laptop so you can simply put the CompactFlash storage card into the adapter and slide the combination into your laptop 's PC card slot ( CardBus II slot ) . It 's a lot faster than USB connection and does not consume any battery from your camera . The PC card adapter is from SanDisk .  
1	  After 94 days ( 4 days past the labor warranty ) the back light went bad on my Creative Zen V 4 GB . I contacted them and of course they told me if they found out it was negligence I would have to pay all ( I got it on Christmas Day it never left the house and I only listened to it at bedtime ) . Then they tell me I 'm responsible for all the shipping and a $ 25.00 diagnostic test ( Now isn't this part of the " labor " warranty that 's good for a year ? ) not according to them . So , just to get it to them it would cost me shipping and the $ 25.00 up front for the work " ( oh , diagnostic test ) " plus all the parts if they can fix it . If you 're not going to buy an Ipod at least save yourself the money and get a San Disk , plus they last longer .  
2	  Sure there are better players but I have seen many much more expensive Sony DVD players that get blown away by this model . It features amazing quality ( even though it is not progressive ) and an amazing range of disk compatability . Mine will read my DVD + R / RW , CD-R / RW , VCD , and SVCD disks without any problems . Other than that - a previous reviewer claimed that you need a p-scan model for a digital TV . He was wrong . This works fine on my HDTV and as the TV has its own p-scan engine ( as most HDTVs do ) there is no reason to get a p-scan DVD - at least in terms of the image quality I am getting .  
1	  My title says it all . Opened the box , tried it , the CD player did not work at all .. returned it .  
2	  This should be included with the camera in the first place . If you are serious about sharp photos , then buy a good tripod and this wireless remote .  
1	  I purchased an Acer aspire 5000 series about 6 months ago , worked fine until recently , it CRASHED ! and 2 times no less ! had to reinstall harddrive to origional and lost ALL my data . plus Im getting a distorting line across my screen which goes away when I reposition the screen ( loose connection or something ) .. top shell of notebook very soft and flimsy . Not well made , going to send back . these Italians should stick to making cars ..  
1	  This keyboard is OK - much better than my old worn out one but the mouse is not responsive enough . Very draggy . Wish it was better . I use this combo of keyboard and mouse as I have limited space . I plug it into my laptop . I probably should rate it as 2.5 stars .  
2	  working very nice and worth it for the price . Neatly Packed with protective case inside . I suggest anyone to buy if they need it .  
2	  So there I was on a road trip in a small Oklahoma town to attend a family reunion , with my Winbook J1 notebook , my digital camera and the idea I 'd take pics and upload them to the notebook to view and share . Till I realized I 'd left the Winbook 's AC power cord at home and there was no way the battery would last long enough to power the things I wanted to do . I went to the local Radio Shack and bought the PS00055-11 Juice . It worked fine . The tip I used at first after trying them , turned out not to be the one the manual listed for my J1 so I changed to that one . I haven't tried to use the DC adapter yet or to use the Juice with any other electronic item . Still , it saved my vacation so if it doesn't wreck my PC , and I get a few more uses out of it before it dies , I 'm reasonably pleased with it . A single AC power / recharge solution is an elegant concept . All these " convenient " electronic devices requiring different cords and cables turn travel into an inconvenient proposition .  
2	  I was looking for a small system for my master bedroom . Thought I 'd be buying something cheapo until I discovered the YHT-150 . I never thought I 'd get Yamaha quality for such a low price . I have not been disappointed . It has plenty of inputs , looks handsome , and the sound is great . The remote works my Sony TV , JVC DVD , and JVC VCR without a problem . If you are looking for an inexpensive home theater , I don't think you can beat it . I only rate it 4 stars because it does not switch S-Video , and the sound ( while very good ) is not as full as the Bose speakers I have in the family room . OK , maybe that 's really not a fair comparison given the price difference . The fact that I dare draw a comparison should tell you how good this system is .  
2	  I had the Degen 1103 for several years , and it has a been a good performer . Sensitive on all bands , so you can do some Dxing on it for weak signals . I must say , it does not match my old Radio Shack DX-440 I had from the 90 's which was an exceptional performer on shortwave ( though more expensive radio ) . The single sideband on the Degen 1103 is a bit narrow , so need to carefully tune in amateur radio signals . But , for the price still a darn good radio .  
1	  This is a mic that requires " power " from your source ( computer ) that being said , it never worked nor my computer recognized it . I bought because of how cheap it was but as they say " you get what you pay for , " returned it .  
2	  I have been a GPS user for years and I don't think you can beat the NUVI 250 for value . Personally I use a Garmin Street Pilot 2620 which is much more expensive , but when I wanted to buy units for my two college age children and the Garmin NUVI 250s were a perfect fit . Most of the great ammenities of my unit , but very compact in size and less than half the price of mine . Not only is this unit pre-loaded with tons of POIs , but the audio system is very clear too . I did my homework and I am glad I decided to by this units for my kids . Oh yeah , my kids think that I am pretty awesome too !  
2	  Great sound for a 2 speaker system . I bought the black ( a little more expensive but go well with my IBM T30 ) .  
1	  Be careful . I bought this battery without realizing it is NOT compatible with the Tablet . Then AntOnline wouldn't accept the return since I opened the package . The product probably works great , but I don't get a warm and fuzzy feeling from the AntOnline customer service .  
2	  The cable was useful for my math courses and now my calculator is able to match up to a Ti-84  
1	  Literately i have only used this printer approximatley less than 10 times to print out basic stuff and to make a copy or two , i purchased it a couple of years ago , but it has just been sitting there most of the time , and the machine just died on me . Two days ago i was using my PC and i turned on the printer , and it did turn on just fine . About 20 minutes i began to print and windows said it was offline , then i went to this printer and it was turned OFF , i tried unplugging the power cord for 20 minutes with the same result , then i left it unplugged during the whole night and in the morning it was still dead . VERY disappointing ! I am hoping it is the power supply that is bad because i can buy that for around $ 40 dollars or so and it is very easy to replace . I was not expecting this from Canon . If anyone has information as to what the problem might be i will appreciate your input .  
2	  For $ [ .. ] and free shipping , how could you go wrong ? We use this iPad stand daily . I originally got this with the idea of using it on a trip .. plane or train usage on fold down table or in the room . But we use it to stand the iPad up when it 's plugged in and to view when in kitchen or living room . We use the DirecTV guide on our iPad to change channels so this lil stand is nice to place your iPad on the coffee table . When I first got this I was bummed until I realized the bottom legs did open up further . At first , it seems like it doesn't which would make it unstable and flimbsy of a stand . Nope , it opens up as wide as the picture shows it . It 's not perfect , but it 's close to it . I love how you can adjust every aspect of the stand to fit whatever angle or shape you want . It is very cushioned with padding behind it and on the legs so your iPad is scratch safe .  
1	  When playing standard audio CDs , there is an audible gap between tracks ! So if you are listening to Dark Side of the Moon , Sgt . Pepper , Kid A , or virtually any live album , you 'll be subjected to a dropout during what should be a smooth transition between tracks ! Really irritating to say the least . I 've never heard of a player having this problem , and as far as I 'm concerned it is unacceptable and inexcusable . I thought maybe I had a defective unit , but upon contacting the manufacturer , I 've been told that it is normal for the sp90 , and nothing can be done about it . I returned mine immediately for a refund . I don't know if the other rio players have this flaw . And by the way , the 120 seconds of skip protection applies only to mp3s-standard audio cds have a maximum of 40 seconds . Buyer beware !  
1	  Oh they look good and are comfortable . Only one problem : they don't work . The left earphone did not work right out of the box . This is clearly the result of poor wiring or a short in the unit and poor quality control .  
2	  This printer is so easy to use . It prints the best photos any size you want . You can print 4x6 using the paper tray , or you can print any other size you want on 8 1/2 x 11 paper . You can choose the format you want to use and it show you everything you do without using your PC . The quality is the best yet ! The consumables cost much less than Epson !  
2	  Paid $ 40 for these a couple of years ago - ended up buying 2 sets and wish I 'd bought more . These sound better than speakers costing $ 150 . Its a shame they don't make them anymore . If you find a set for under $ 50 - buy them !  
1	  I was expecting an easy installation of this device on my computers ; simply plug the device in and install the driver . However , installation failed on both of my computers . When running setup ( automatically started when I put in the driver CD ) , I got a " Please Plug-In C-Media USB Sound " alert message , which I am guessing indicates it did not discover the device . After this , installation does not continue as described in the PDF user 's manual , and the device remains unrecognized . This device is likely a dud , and StarTech probably put their logo on some cheap USB Audio Adapter coming out of Asia ( the manual requires a Chinese plug-in for the PDF reader ) . If Amazon replaces this device easily , and it works , I will do a new review or modify this one .  
1	  I have no idea what happened to it . It was playing perfectly . The quality of this CD player is better than any other player I 've ever owned . This morning , as I walked out to the bus , it refused to read my CD . Every other CD I tried either would not be read , took forever to be read and then shut off , or the player would skip almost every track and play a very few . Even with those few , the track would skip . I tried this with scratched and unscratched CDs , and it 's certainly not the CD . How long have I had it ? A week and a half . I 'm very upset , because it 's the best CD player I 've ever owned and usually , Sony players put up with all the abuse they go through in my life . This one ? Not at all . I 'm resorting back to my old one that is nearly in two pieces but still plays perfectly . Good luck with the Psyc ; I didn't have any .  
2	  I have used these disks alot and have bought more than one spindle and had no bad burns so far . I would recomend this product . good job memorex  
2	  The Panasonic S52 is great for at home stereo / television use because it is light , convenient and portable enough to fit in a suitcase between trips . The picture quality is excellent and it delivers deep bass and clear treble which means it 's ideal as a cd player too whether it 's hooked up to a stereo or just a tv .  
1	  I purchased this system several years ago and have enjoyed viewing DVD 's on this system . Until recently I never bothered to run my cable box ( HDTV ) through it , mostly due to the fact that I thought I was doing something wrong when trying configure the system . I could never get it to work . I have now learned that my sytem will not play ANY external devices . Now , I 'm going to have to pay for service on this system that probably never worked correctly out of the box .  
1	  I bought this cable cause its cheap like me . It got here in 1 day practically but it doesnt work for the xbox 360 you get the famous E74 error usually pertaining to a bad AVI / HDMI cable . I picked up a cable at frys for 2 bucks more and dont have an issues . Wish i didnt waste the money though .  
2	  I bought this to use on my PC for Skype . Plug and play , simply insert USB and off you go . Like the boom so I can point to where I am ( or others ) . I can recommend .  
2	  Canon PowerShot SD600 6MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical ZoomThis camera 's LCD screen became unusable within 2-3 months of use-it has a break that shows clearly across the screen . My daughter says it has not been dropped and had no major temperature changes . It does take good pictures , but we have to use the viewfinder .  
2	  Got this as a gift and it seems to work fine . He loves it . Its already seen much use . Glad I chose this over the audio-technica . Classy and simple look , not difficult to set up , low-maintenance . Great sound .  
1	  I really wanted this to work so I could listen to my Ipod while driving . The price was certainly right . It did work great for about 2 months . After that it would gradually work loose and lose conection . You could reseat the adapter and it would work for a while before you would have to reseat it again . After about 4 months the only way it would work is if you held it place . Not very practical while driving .  
1	  I got lucky and was able to take these back to Staples after creating 6 frisbees out of 10 . But only to buy Sony and have the same problem . This isn't the first time I 've had problems with Memorex or Sony . They also tend to start skipping and become unreadable after a couple years . Definitely not ' green ' companies since I imagine a lot of their cds end up in the trash heap ! When can we get some quality in this country ?  
1	  You 'd think they couldn't mess up something this simple . When I plugged it in , I got no power light . After fiddling with the power button for about 2 minutes , the light did come on , but the start button stayed pushed-in . This made it impossible to open the lid . The eject and stop buttons did absolutely nothing . I had to try my best to pry it open since I had a tape in there . I have no idea why it behaved like that but I have heard from others afterwards that it is a common problem . The company must have saved a bundle in engineering this product .  
2	  Like most of us , I spent a significant amount of time researching MP3 players . I finally decided on a Creative Zen Vision : M 30 GB MP3 and video player . What a buy ! I got a great price from Amazon and it works great . The average rating for this product was four out of five stars . I gave it five stars because it rocks !  
1	  The camera seems to work ok but the software just freezes up most of the time andI have a terrible time getting the pictures . Not to mention the special effects , they just aren't what theyre cracked up to be . Now I cant even get tech support on it . the website .. wont even come up .  
2	  I purchased this unit to replace a trendnet 4 port switch . I simply ran out of ports . It works fine as long as the xbox360 is not plugged into it . I had to plug the 360 into the router itself or I would constantly dropconnections . I have a media player , desktop computer , laptop ( cat 5 ) , pioneer receiver and sometimes the basement computerall running at once . No problems . But plug the 360 in and big problems . Like always no two networks are the same . What does not work for me MAY work for you . Milton  
2	  Went through the old " plasma vs LCD " game for a couple of months . Could of fit a 46in LCD in my entertainment center . Looked hard at the LCD 's and just decided for me , sports and movies , the plasma gave a better image . A little more film like and not as edgy as the LCD 's . LCD 's look great upon first viewing , but watch some sports and people 's faces . For my usage , plasma works better right now . Bought this TV when the price dropped . Love the gloss black frame . Picture , after 100hr break in and adjustment , is stunning on HD and acceptable on SD . SD will always look a little soft , nature of the source . Have read many accounts on the web of this set " buzzing " . Set my TV up in the dining room for a few days just in case I got a " bee hive " in a box . Set was super quiet . VERY SMALL buzzing from the top left I could only hear if my ear was 6in away . At 2ft + it was quiet . Yea ! Then went through reconfiguring my entertainment center , new HD cable box , new AV recv'r , new DVD upconvert player , new speakers , just a few wires to re-route . Got everything connected , cleaned off fingerprints , sat back and turned it on . BUUZZ . Dang ! ( or words to that effect ) Sound was not tolerable until the volume was turned up past 15 . Now it 's 1am . Looking on line for what I might return the set and get , dreading the back and forth of service calls on a new set , kicking myself for not heading the " buzz " warnings I had seen online . After about 30 minutes of self flogging , I realized " hey the set was quiet in the dining room . what changed ? " Started doing the old cable check , surge protector check , even tried another outlet on the same wall . Nada . Then I got a thought , grabbed one of my Transparent Audio Power Cables . It 's one of those semi-hi-end filtered AC cords . Plugged it in to the Samsung , turned the TV back on , and whisper quiet was returned . Picture even looked clearer , might just be me though . Guess the end result is , I 'm extremely pleased with the picture quality , set looks great even when off , new antiglare screen dramitcally reduces room glare . It 's in a 16x24 room and looks awesome . However you MUST have a clean AC plug or some type of quality power filter / conditioner , not your regular surge protector , to get the most from this set . For some reason this set , or maybe plasmas in general , are more sensative to line issues . Good luck on your choice . I 'm happy with this one . Now if I could only fit that 63in plasma .. :-)  
1	  This arm clamp broke the first day I used it ! Within 2 minutes of setting it up at a shoot the clamp head snapped off in my hand . Save your money .  
1	  I ordered this even though I read some of the bad reviews , and now feel like an idiot , because though I can hear everyone fine , they all tell me I sound far away and fuzzy . Money DOWN THE DRAIN .  
2	  Simple review ; I LOVE IT ! Believe me , I looked all over the internet , looked at all those Youtube reviews etc etc . This is what I found and what I purchased . It ' s the best ! . Buy it , no hassle , easy to use , comes in a handy bag with all the goodies . The steady view ( IS ) is AMAZING ! It ' s like a digital camera that you focus .  
2	  I BOUGHT AN RCA HDV 5000 FROM ICON OUTFIT ONJULY 13 th 2009 . WHEN I RECIEVED IT , THE BOX WASVERY TATTY BUT NOT OPENED . I OPENED THE BOX ANDIT LOOKS OK . NOW COMES THE BAD NEWS . I CALLEDUP TO GET THEM TO SEND ME THE UPDATE DISC , THEY TELL ME I SHOULD GET IT IN TWO TO THREEWEEKS , SO I WAIT & I WAIT . WHEN IT ARRIVES THEDISC IS SOME SORT OF HOME MADE COPY , BUT THE TWOPAGES OF INSTRUCTIONS THAT CAME WITH IT , YOU CANNOTREAD ANY OF IT ALL , SO NOW I WAITING FORA 2 nd SET TO GET HERE .  
1	  The Transcent 4GB SD memory is worthless . We bought one for our Cannon Digital Camera , used it once for about 5 days on vacation and it stopped working . Could not get it to respond in the camera nor in our computer . All pictures and video lost ! Vendor will not replace ( as if we want another of the same .. ) due to the fact that 30 days have passed since purchase ! ( We were in Costa Rica for 3 weeks .. ) DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ! DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE !  
2	  I purchased to make taking digital picture simple for my family and it does just that . The batteries that come with the dock last over a couple of hundred shots on our Fuji a210 camera , depending on flash usage . The simple connection to the PC makes it easy for my family to e mail picture to friends or to Ofoto for great processing .  
1	  I wish I had seen these reviews before buying . The switch stops working until it is cycled . This problem occurs sometimes once every few days to several times a day . Considering the price of the unit and information provided by other reviews , its not worth the time and effort getting an RMA , I 'm just going to throw it out .  
1	  Here 's a list of what I 've discovered I CAN'T do with the Sony Spressa CD-RW . I CANNOT : Do a full backup and restore , Restore large files from CD-RW back to hard disk . Also , when recording music from CD to CD , it is often necessary to first copy to C drive then to CD-RW . This is difficult if you don't have alot of space on your C drive . I 'm disapointed with this product , and for more reasons than I 've listed .  
2	  When I bought this , I wasn't buying for the actual UV protection ; I just wanted to put something between the glass of my ( rather expensive ) lens and the ground should I accidentally drop the camera . However , since I put this on the lens , I have noticed a marked increase in the quality of images that I get out of the camera . Green and blue casts seem all but gone , and everything just generally looks sharper . For the price , I couldn't ask much more . I can't recommend it highly enough .  
2	  This camera is so compact and easy to use . The battery recharges quickly and last a long time . The speed between pictures is good . The movie mode works well . If you need a lot of zoom , you may want a different model . If you want something easy to cart around , this is a good choice .  
2	  THIS PRODUCT ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT SHAPE . IT HAS WORKED SMOOTHLY FOR THREE MONTHS WITH 180 DISK PLAYING . I HAVE HAD SOME TROUBLE WITH BACKUP COPIES FOR DISK . THEY SEEM TO HAVE A SKIP AND DO NOT PLAY WELL IN THIS UNIT . I HAD TO BURN NEARLY 30 PERCENT OVER TO GET A GOOD PLAY . STILL HAVE SOME CASES WHEN THE PLAYER WOULD NOT MOVE TO THE NEXT DISK . THIS WAS ONLY ON BURNED MATERIAL . THE PLAYER WORKS GREAT WITH ALL NEW DISK . HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS UNIT FOR EASE OF USE . DEAN  
1	  I am somewhat disappointed in this item , I bought it in hopes of being able to use my computer on my couch without overheating . Although it does take longer for the computer to overheat than it normally does , but it still overheats . I ended up buying another product Rolodex Laptop Stand which works great ! Too bad I wasted my money with this Belkin product , I am surprised on the good reviews it had . Now it makes me think the reviews may have been fake .  
1	  This hard drive gets very hot , very quickly , and then start to fail , I bought it half and a year ago , and I don't use it so much , but now is failing in the big way :( I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU TO BUY THIS HARD DRIVE , at least you want to lose some files .. it get bad sectors now .. and I have 4 drives more of different capacities an none of those drives failed .. but this is the new one , and the worst .. don't ever buy it .. or you will sorry in a future .. I don't get advice of all reviews and now I 'm paying for it . :'( .. My drive : Western Digital 500GB 3.5 " , SATA , 16MB Cache Bulk / OEM Hard Drive WD5000AAKS  
2	  I bought this for an additional disc magazine . It works perfect just like the original . Good product .  
2	  It increased my computer speed and application loading and running  
2	  I bought this frame for my mom and she loved it ! I loaded more than 160 photos and set it up to rotate through all of them . My mom is starting to lose her memory , so it really helps to see these pictures again and again . I was even able to set the frame up to go on and off at set times so she never has to worry about doing anything with it-a great feature ! The picture quality is excellent and it 's fun to watch it go from one photo to the next because it 's always different . The frame was a bit pricey . There are cheaper ones available , but I wanted the larger frame ( 8 " ) , and those cost a lot more . I also had some trouble getting all the photos uploaded that I wanted to . I purchased a 1GB disk but it kept telling me it was full when it clearly wasn't . I managed to get all the pictures on it that I had , but it did take me a long time , and I 'm still not quite sure what I did . Overall , this is a terrific frame !  
1	  For those of you who have been trying to get this monitor replaced , I just got off the phone with HP Technical Support and , after screaming at three different people who kept telling me that they could not help me unless I paid for the privilege to talk to them ( because the warranty is expired ) , I finally got to speak to a fourth person .. a supervisor . After giving him my serial number , I was told that this monitor HAS BEEN RECALLED and will be replaced free of charge . I do not have the specifics yet as to how it will be accomplished , but I was given a case number and was told that he ( the supervisor ) would personally call me back within a day or two with the details . In the meantime , I still have to unplug the monitor and plug it back in every time it blacks out . This morning , that was happening every 2-3 seconds , but right now it seems to be ok for the moment . So , to everyone who has been ripped off with this monitor , get on the phone right now to HP Technical Support , tell them that you have a monitor that has been recalled , and don't take no for an answer . Good luck !  
2	  This is the second Harmony 550 Universal remote we purchased . The first one we purchased from Amazon was for our main TV system with HDTV , surround sound , DVD / CD player , Direct TV and DVR . The remote switches between the various options I programmed in , like Watch TV , Watch a DVD , Listen to radio , Play CD , Play Ipod , etc . and turns on and off the correct components and switches to the correct TV input when required . I found the Logitech programing fairly intuitive and easy to use . The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that on rare occassions , the remote does not select the correct input on the HDTV . However , if you just press the " HELP " button on the remote , it will prompt you asking " Did that fixed the problem " . If you answer " NO " , it will try again , and I have always found that this fixes the problem . We purchased a second 550 for our Bedroom TV which just has an HDTV with combination DVD / VCR player and it works the same way . You do have to use a different sign on for each remote with Logitech for programming a subequent remote , but that was not a problem . My wife , who is a self proclaimed techno-neophite , has no trouble operating either TV / remote when I am not home . I would definetly recommend this product if you are looking for a realitively inexpensive remote with lots of features and easy to use .  
2	  Well , each cable was . 23 cents .. I can find no reason to pay more than that . The cables work perfectly ! The shipping was more ! UPDATE ! I 've been using them for a about a year now . Still perfect !  
1	  After reading the ' good picture ' reviews from all the others , I have experienced the opposite . compared to a bl-c10a that I have , a bl-c30a had a very fuzzy picture . It is clear from 8 inches to 4 ft . Beyond that it is fuzzy . After and exchange the 2nd one is exactly the same . Clearly some kind of lens problem . Panasonic spt , told me to upgrade FW and closed the ticket . ( I had the latest FW already ) lousy spt . Also , The ' WEP OPEN spt ' , no WPA bothers me . Of course means your whole wireless has to be less secure . Wireless G , continuously losses 3 to 10 % of packets 2 ft from the router , what is up with this ? I hope this is not the New Panasonic , cause my $ 3000 plasma is Panasonic .. Im looking for something with PTZ , VGA , 30fps that I can afford , for security .. Returned both , may return CL-10A , because I want one app for multi-cameras ..  
2	  Just wish it had center squeeze buttons . Hard to reach those outside buttons when the hood is on . But I like the OEM metal cap with the CANON name on it .  
1	  I usually use Consumer Reports to buy stuff . I think they ranked this highly . I had an HP deskjet for years and loved it . I think it was a 722 . Print quality great , started up with a print job , NO PROBLEMS ever . Then I bought a new computer and the printer had to connect via USB as opposed to the old parallel port , which my old printer had . I thought , oh , this won't be a big deal . I 'll get rid of Old Faithful and buy a new HP . The K5400 . What a nightmare . The only good aspect was the printing speed . Otherwise , everything was downhill from my old one . It doesn't start when you send a print job to it . ( Maybe that 's a Windows XP deal . I don't know . ) It takes ages to warm up so that it can print . The print quality was so much worse than my old Deskjet . Black streaks half the time on color artwork . And then one day the printheads failed . I cleaned them according to the HP support directions ten times . As I cleaned the printheads , I noticed their warranty had expired five days before my cleaning marathon . And of course , the cleaning didn't help . They lasted less than two years and never experienced heavy use or weeks of non-use . Home , no office work , probably one print out a day . And now , because I need a printer , I have allowed hope to triumph over experience and I 've bought another HP . Wish me luck . My final word on this subject : don't buy this printer .  
1	  this transmitter looked and felt like cheap , but worse , the adapter did not fit into my Honda cigarette lighter ! I returned it and bought the DLO TransDock which works great .  
1	  Be careful .. it 's not competible to many laptops .. eg IBM , Toshiba , Dell .. Also very bad reception  
2	  Buy this mouse - it whips anything Microsoft has to offer . Why : 1 . 7 programmable buttons plus smooth scroll wheel2 . 800-dpi tracking , won't skip ever . ever . 3 . Flexible software lets you use Back and Forward buttons , as well as the wheel , in games . 4 . Sturdy , will last you years . 5 . Silver & black looks awesome . I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I could . Why : 1 . Intellimouse Explorer fits my hand a little better . ( thats just me . ) 2 . Most games won't recognize the Maximize , Minimize , and Program Switch buttons . Otherwise , this mouse is for YOU , playas . Simply the best wired mouse out there . Good going , Logitech .  
1	  I purchased this adapter to enable hook up of a scrolling sign . Cable does not recognize sign . After finding this out , I tried to remove software from my computer . It will not uninstall . Have tried everything to no avail .  
2	  I just bought this a month back along with a USB wireless device . Both work fine . The wireless router was pretty easy to install . The connection is great , although sometimes the link strength reads ~ 50 % but I havent seen a drop in performance . Overall I am pretty happy with this .  
2	  I bought the FPD2185W monitor with a package in 2005 and it went until 2010 before it had the same problem that is mentioned all over the web . The capacitors failed and I took it to a local shop where my main man found the bad capacitors and replaced them them and it just crapped out again ( April 2012 ) but for the very good reason that my repair man saved me a couple of dollars and didn't replace ALL the capacitors . I found a guy on the web who is retired and has made a part time business of repairing this particular monitor . Why would he do that ? How could he do that ? Because this monitor has a very dedicated fan base , including me . Reason ? The monitor is simply the best monitor I have been able to find to this day . Versatility , options and picture quality etc . cannot be matched . You can switch to portrait view by simply rotating the monitor on its very good stand ( heavy but I am not packing it around the office ) . It appears that you can find working versions of this monitor for around $ 90-$125 and I would tell you it is worth it . If you have to replace the capacitors , and you probably have , I hope you changed them all . Evidently the original board was manufactured in China so be sure the tech uses Japanese capacitors as replacement . I love this monitor and I sent it to the new guy yesterday ( 5/18/12 ) and I will come back and edit to let you know how it worked out . Of course , if the estimate comes back too high I will simply have to find another . The new guy claims to have several in stock that are up and running . He 's repaired them . I gave it 5 stars for the performance of the monitor overall but Gateway , as I originally met it is dead to me . When Ted sold the company it took a dive like no other . Too bad , I used to love their ads . Cows ! What 's not to like ? About Cows . Gateway service ? There is none .  
2	  I was very pleased with this product . The purchase comes with two stands . The stands were easy to assemble . The stands are pressboard wood . They are solid and the paint on them hasn't chipped or flaked , except for one place .. read on to find out . I have fairly large speakers and the stands support them well . The only thing I didn't like very much was the way the wire cover was implemented on the back of the stand . You get two pieces of flat , semi-flexible plastic that you insert into two slots cut on the back of the stand . You have to bend the plastic into a half pipe and then slide them down the base of the stand while keeping the plastic half pipe in the slot . It took a couple of tries to get the plastic pieces to bend and then slide into the slots that retain them . I nicked the top of the wood at the top and it chipped a bit of the paint off . However , once I figured it out and got them in it looks pretty good . Effective and attractive .  
1	  DONT BUY THIS PIECE OF " POOP " Like others says this thing dosen't fit on the car they specified and theres no way to make it fit . Trust me I 'm been a system installer for more that 10 years now and I have never seen a soo useless piece of plastic on my life , and even WORSE ! Amazon is backing up this thing ! . It seems like it 's just a black plastic frame that you install on top of your preinstalled estero and it just to cover some openings around it , It dosen't have any means to hold or secure your stero so the stereo has to be bolted or secured by other means to your car 's dashboard . Ohh and I almost forgot ! .. it also have a very thin pocket under of the unit , and it 's made of cheap plastic . SincerelyA very desapointed Amazon customer .  
1	  I bought this router and spent hours , over two days , with online support trying to get it to work . The support people were helpful but do not work fast . Conculsion , I got a bad router and I needed to return it for another . I got a replacment and after less than three months it has completely died . Urgh ! Either the design is flawed or the factory is doing a really poor job making them . Buy at your own risk .  
2	  This router is very easy to set up and works verk well in a small office .  
2	  This item was recommended to me by a friend and has functioned as advertised . Hard drives that normally get hot when operating in their original enclosure are now cool to the touch . Quite a change .  
1	  This bag is small ! Kodak . com says it fits the P850 . Barely ! I have lenses , battery rechargers and an external flash . There is not enough room for everything . There are velcro strips on the inside of the bag that allow you to move the dividers around which are useless since you can't even move the dividers due to some kind of built-in loops for holding pens or pencils or something of the sort . If I were to put a writing utensil in the loops there would be even LESS room for a camera . My camera makes the dividers bulge outward leaving no room for the first and third compartments .  
2	  The pentax optio x , it ? s a great camera for some many reasons , but the most important for me , is that i can get great pictures from me an my couple , without asking help to any other person to hold the camera ..  
1	  Although this pack is the best you can buy if you want to save money , one realizes early on that companies producing photo printers are making too much money on the printer ink : they have to bring down the prices eventually .  
1	  I have the same problem with a blank screen . I have owned this TV for a little less than two years and yesterday the screen went blank . I called the customer service center and said they have no idea what I am talking about . Do not buy this TV ..  
2	  The Solio better energy iPod charger is a fantastic product . On a sunny winter day it charged 50 % in a time span of about an hour or so . It will also charge in the closed position ( for when you don't want to draw attention to yourself in a public place ) . With two fanblades open it looks like a cell phone , everyone who has seen the charger with two fanblades open has told me that and it helps in being less conspicious ( as people just assume its a new phone ) . It also comes with a suction cup and I haven't really used it because .. 1 . The warranty doesn't cover damages caused by the suction cup coming loose and falling to the ground . 2 . Putting a pencil through the slot and aiming it towards the sun is much easier . The button on the charger was also perplexing , but I figured it out from the multilingual packet and this is what it does . Pushing the button once when its not connected give a battery life estimate ex : 1 flash = 25 % 2 flashes = 50 % and so on . While connected it does not automatically realize its hooked up to the iPod . A push of the button and it will start to charge the iPod . Overall this is a great product that deserves more attention .  
2	  I 've been a Windows / Unix user all my life . This is my first Mac and I love it . Pros : - Mac OS X is way more stable than any Microsoft Windows available - Did you know that Mac OS X is UNIX-based ? I love real unix shell . - Light & small - Slot-loading optical drive is better than the regular one , IMO - Wi-Fi 802.11b / g + bluetooth now included - & uuml ; ber-long battery life . My 5-month old battery lasts about 3 hours when I 'm just browsing the web ( wifi-on , bluetooth-on ) - not likely to get infected by virus / malware / spyware . - iLife suite included - supports dual display - I use this PB as a desktop replacement - high quality soundcard - i 've seen some PC laptop that has crappy soundcard . It 's bad to the point that your MP3 sound really badCons : - Admit it , there are less software for Mac OS X. Make sure that you know everything you need has Mac version available . Don't depend on Virtual PC . It 's tad slow on this 1.33GHz cpu . - Software running on Mac is not as optimized as it should . - This is the cheapest powerbook available . It 's LCD screen isn't as good as 15 " / 17 " ones . It 's acceptable , reliable but you cannot expect something as good as - 256 meg of ram is NOT enough for you to run regular software smoothly . Consider adding at least another 256 . - internal fan is sometime annoying when you do heavy graphics / calculation . You cannot watch DVD fullscreen without headphone . It 's THAT noisy .  
1	  I purchased the CX300 , because it came with different size ear buds . However I found that none of the buds would keep the earphones in my ears even when sitting . I finally had to remove the buds entirely but then found that there was no base although the sound was good . I guess I have large ears would you think ? They are inexpensive enough that I didn't send them back . If you have no problem with regular ear buds I feel sure that they would work for you .  
2	  This radio is very easy to set up and receives a nice strong signal . Nice blue back-lit LCD which can be programmed to stay on all the time or go on only when an alert comes on or you press the weather button . Nice and compact ; however , the battery door is flimsy and does nto snug / snap in . Other con - No mounting holes in the back to mount the unit on a wall . Has desk mount stubs ; however , you can not see the screen unless you look directly on top of the radio . Wrote to Midland to see if there is a wall mount kit ; however , as I figured , I never received an email back . Overall it is a good radio .  
1	  THIS IS A TERRIBLE PRODUCT IS MADE OF CHEAP PLASTIC AND AFTER YOU ATTACH IT TO CAMERA THERE IS A LOT OF PLAY IT DOES NOT FIT NICE AND TIGHT , IT MAKES THE CAMERA FEEL CHEAP , THE PEOPLE WHO DESIGNED THIS JUNK DO NOT HAVE ANY IDEA OF MEASUREMENTS , IT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE IF A DIFFERENT COMPANY MADE THIS THING .. BUT CANON MADE THIS .. I DON'T GET IT WHY IT DOES NOT FIT PERFECTLY SNUGH . BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARDS GUYS !

2	  I 've been in search of a perfect set of in-ear earphones for iPod . I 've purchased different earphones and tried many , and this V-Moda Bass Freq comes in at " pretty good " for the price . First thing you 'll notice with these earphones is that the cord attached to these earbuds are super thin , though highly flexible . If you 're like me who use ( and abuse ) the earphones everyday , you may worry about its durability . I have not used these for more than a month so far , so time will tell .. The sound quality is better than average of what you can find in this price range . As the name suggests , and many of the other reviewers had stated that these earphones give you a lot of bass . A LOT ! If you like a lot of bass these earphones would be perfect for you . For me , it 's a little too much . Some music gets drowned in bass although the earphones are giving you fairly good mids and highs . I had to use equalizer to tone down the bass .. I own a pair of very high-end earbuds from Shure , and if you compare the sound from Shure to V-Moda , you can tell all that bass from V-Moda is very unbalanced . I do have Apple 's " In-Ear Headphones " , and I must say they have much better balance ( though I don't recommend Apple 's at all ) than V-Moda . For example , if you listen to pop or hip-hop music a lot , V-Moda may be good for it , but if you listen to folk or guitar-heavy rock , or even classic ( a lot of acoustic instrument ) you may find V-Moda to be too bass-heavy or even find the sound to be muddy . As an alternative ( if you aren't looking for too much base ) , so far in my quest to find the perfect set of ipod earphones , I likeSony Mdr-Ex75 / Blk Ex Earbuds Headphones with 9Mm Hi-Sensitivity Driver ( Black ) for the price , and all around sound quality . They 're in-ear type to block outside noise , and they 're comfortable wearing ( and so is V-Moda , by the way ) . Very good balance overall in bass , mids , and highs , and very clear sounding . They 're also pretty sturdy too , unlike the super thin V-Moda cords .. I have tried Bose TriPort but I cannot justify their high price tag .. Sony sounds better imho .  
1	  PalmOne IIc ( Reconditioned ) Worked very Good for a short period . Touch pad does not respond correctly to stylus taps . Very frustrating to enter info .  
2	  A great way to obtain excellent long-scale 16 bit digital copies from 35mm film and slides . With a high-end camera like the Nikon D800 or equivalent and a good macro lens , the quality is better than one would get with many film scanners .  
2	  There are 6 channels in my area near Charlottesville , VA . The stations are 6-7 miles from my home . I hooked this antenna to my HD TV , clicked my remote to run an automatic channel tune check . I immediately , with no adjustments , received all six channels , clear , or better , than cable . What more can I say . Cheap . Works well . No muss , no fuss . There are other channels , not closer than about 50 miles LOS , which I did not receive , so I can only vouch for 6-7 miles distant from my area .  
1	  Well , it did everything I expected it to do for 11 months and now its dead . I wasn't expecting much due to its price last year and it worked like a charm up till a few weeks ago , when it would occasionally shut itself off . That became more and more frequent until today when it will power up , display the first picture , the display will degrade and go green and pixelated and then it shuts off . Over and over again . Time for the trash bin . Regardless of the price ( unless it was free ) , something like this has to last longer than 11 months . Judging from the reviews , I won't be buying a replacement frame from Mustek .  
1	  I have a Belkin Pre-N network at my house and liked the specs on the new Linksys product ( WMP300N PCI adapter and the WRVS4400n router and access point ) for my office . Out of the box nothing worked . An upgrade to . 13 firmware in the router at least got it working . Speeds are impressive , but as many others have noted , the system hangs up at random times driving users to distraction . I returned the product and reinstalled my Cat 6 cables . Once Linksys gets the bugs out I 'll try them again , but they released this product without enough testing , in my opinion . This is a classic example of buyer beware .  
2	  I 've read in some forums that this VGA cooler would actually fit an 8600 gts video card , is it true ? anyone know if this information is accurated ? i got an evga 8600gts 512ddr3 video card and i would like to know if this cooler would actually fit it to just buy it . Thanks for the help in advance =)  
1	  worked a very little bit then quit . would not buy this again . 8 more words re qu re d don  
2	  Only comment - make sure you call your provider and give them the new MAC address  
1	  My Nuvi came with this kit , but I only got the adhesive disk to stay a few days , and that 's without having the unit suctioned on full-time . The suction cup sticks great - so much so that I have to break the seal even after releasing the lever . But I can't have it on my windshield full time and am sure the adhesive disk will not stay on in August / September , even if I could get it to stay on now . I do not see a way to purchase just the disk ( guess I 'll contact Garmin directly ) . I can't even just lay the Nuvi on a flat spot unless I disconnect the power cable . I suppose I will be forking out an additional $ 30 to try the beanbag .  
2	  Glad I found this item on the net . fits my Canon PowerShot A460 excellently and works perfectly . If only it could store power so I could take it along with me wherever I go .  
1	  I wish I had read the reviews first ! I too received theitem with an empty cleaning fluid bottle ! Bummer . ButAmazon is giving me a complete refund and paying my postage !  
1	  Hello , I 've had the same problem with this tv . The blue blotches and the yellow discoloration . My warranty did expire though Zenith did say they would cover the 2500 dollar part . That 's nice and all , but I assume they are using the same parts that these tvs were initially built with . I expect it will work for about another year or so until I 'm faced with having to shell out all that money to have it fixed again . I 'm wondering if any legal action can be taken against Zenith / LG for manufacturing and selling a defective product ? Perhaps it falls under some kind of product liability law ? I Just want my money back and I 'll be satisfied !  
1	  We bought the Xtreme 320 holder . The zipper broke within weeks ! This means you can't carry or store the thing unless it 's flat . So , basically the money we spent on it is in the toilet . Guess you get what you pay for . We 'll be buying a quality case now .  
2	  I got the screen after reading some reviews of them in a different internet forum , people were complaining about hot-spotting . I 've had the screen setup for a while , the brightness pretty much compares to the wall its covering , so .. doesn't help my DLP projector when I have the lights on . However , the screen looks great , the black velvet borders do a fantastic job of framing the image and everything I 've watched looks fantastic , from any angle . Setting up the screen was .. difficult , stretching the fabric and fitting into the slots was pretty hard ( the rods you insert into the fabric are very hard to hold ) and I was nervous about how hard I was pulling it . In the end , after a few hours it was done . All-in-all I enjoy the screen , its certainly a great value , you can find more expensive fixed-frame screens , they might have better performance , but this one seems pretty great .  
2	  Was exactly what we ordered . Works great would recomend to others .  
2	  After two years with the Canon i550 , the Pixma 3000 is a significant upgrade and a great little printer . Best Features : - Superior Photo Quality ( 4 ink tanks but very , very good print quality ) . Good looking prints even on generic / non-Canon paper . - Separate paper cassette like most laser printers . Don't underestimate the convenience of this . I can now load photo paper underneath in the cassette and regular paper in the top . The driver lets me setup a profile for borderless photo printing and it automatically takes the paper from the cartridge - Duplex unit . This works great , printing on both sides of the paper without requiring you to turn the paper around . Very slick . So far , no significant downsides . Only shortfall may be the inability to print directly to CD 's . I 'll wait and see how much the print nozzles get clogged ( finally killed my i550 ) .  
1	  I bought this because I wanted to hear stations in either Europe or the Middle East . I really can't hear any of those places . I heard Toronto , Mexico , one Asian country , and a French speaking station that wasn't come out clear enough . The AM and FM are very good , though . And it is a very small radio . But I am looking for a strong Shortwave at a bargain , and I didn't get that .  
1	  I was initially thrilled to get the wireless keyboard and mouse at the great price , although I bought it because the mouse fits better than other big ones on my hand . However , after using for three months , I had to give up using the mouse , as the mouse seem to roam freely on its own will . I mean the mouse cursor on the screen . I guess , it is due to noise from all the other wireless device near my computer desk - couple of 2.4 GHz phones , wireless router , bluetooth headphones and transmitter , and probably the huge speaker on which this mouse transmitter sits ( and the fluroscent lamps , VCR , printers and what not ) . I am not sure of noise problem on the keyboard , as I do not type that much , but I do graphics with the mouse , and it is a pain to point at anything accurately - it will move slightly at the last moment on its own . So today I had to switch to the old wired $ 5 mouse back . Also , my wife uses the keyboard much , and she immeditely noticed that the letters on the keys are printed very small , and like us , if you are used to type while looking at the keys ( not a touch typist ) , it is a strain to look at the much smaller letters - about half the size of letters on standard Dell or Gateway keyboard , which I had earlier . Also the key clusters on right have changed as noted by another reviewer , but I can live with it . Since I switched to wired mouse , I guess I will switch back to my earlier wired keyboard which came with my desktop , and put this wirelses set on sale on crigslist or ebay .  
2	  I had owned an earlier version of this Pioneer 6-Disc CD Changer for nearly 15 years , and it had worked flawlessly . When it finally stopped working , I was delighted to find that basically the same changer was still available . I am happy to report that the new changer appears to be as dependable as the old and is as easy to use . I highly recommend it .  
2	  This battery charger works well . The Sony rechargeable batteries lasted a long time in my digital camera . The only thing this charger is missing is a battery refresh to drain any charge left in your batteries before you recharge . That is why I only gave it a rating of 4 .  
2	  I bought this camera as an upgrade from the S200 . I can keep all my previous accessories and get the higher resolution and zoom features . It takes pictures faster than the S200 ( focus , shutter , and flash seem faster ) and still the same size and weight ( in fact , I think it 's a bit lighter ) . Plus , at $ 250 it 's quite a bargain .  
2	  My mom had been without television for quite a while due to a switch to digital broadcasting . I bought her a newer digital-ready LCD television and this antenna for x-mas . Due to icy conditions on her steeply-pitched roof , I elected to install the antenna in the attic of her older wood-framed house . I attached the DB2 to a stick , leaned it against an upright 2 x 4 , ran a 75 ' length of coax cable through the wall downstairs , hooked it up and had the television scan for channels . As I had not oriented the antenna and had read the disclaimer warning about signal loss for interior vs exterior installation , I wasn't expecting much . The television found every channel in the area , including two my mother had never seen before . There was no sign of signal loss whatsoever . I just went back up the ladder into the attic , nailed the antenna in place and called it a day . My mom , who is on a fixed income , was very happy and decided she didn't need a cable television subscription after all .  
1	  Look at all of the reviews below - Error 41 - I have had 2 in the last 9 months - each time the units are replaced by brother with units that have been refurbished ( Probably error 41 ) . Unless you have more time on your hands then you need and reliability is not an issue , get something else . For all of us that have already been ripped off - someday a class action suit must be in the cards !  
1	  I have developed pain in my hands , mostly my thumbs from excessive keyboarding and probably some arthritis . I ordered this keyboard with hopes of improving my condition . I wish I had read the negative reviews closer . While there are many features that are good and the general feel of the keyboard is comfortable , the space bar was a deal breaker for me . My thumbs are already so sore , having to press the space bar so hard made my condition even worse ! Sorry , but I will be returning it .  
2	  I use the headset with a Cisco 7960 - works great . I strongly recommend this product - excellent range and battery life . Too bad it 's not possible to pickup / hangup without connecting a headset lifter ( lame ) .  
1	  It has not worked properly from day 1 . It is now taking over a month to get repaired . Buy any other MP3 player , or IPOD . Zune seems not to have it together  
1	  I have been using this for years and have found that I can never trust it to keep any new info . Taking it on the road and relying on it to not crash is prohibitivly risky . I stripped out all 3rd party software including avant go and only use the bare basic calendar , phonelist and notes and still find it crashes WAY too frequently , needing a reset that wipes out everything in its memory untill my next hot sync . Much as I like the functionality that it was designed for , I 'm sick of this piece of crap and am searching hard for a reliable PDA . Hey Palm ! How about making a PDA that is reliable and comes with good free tech support for two years ( i.e. try not to put your customers on hold forever or charge them excessive fees to fix your unreliable equipment ) . If any of your competitors do it first I have plenty of money to throw down . nuff said , grr  
2	  Nice for the wireless home w / more than one computer . I have three wireless computer on a N network . Once I did get the install disk to work the rest was easy and everything prints from the network .  
2	  This product has worked well so far . I needed the ability to extend the cables that runs from my elation copilot 3 to the corresponding power boxes it controls . If you 're lost already google & # 34 ; Elation Copilot 3 & # 34 ; . It will clear up an confusion . The lighting controller only came with a 25 foot cable and a 10 foot cable , which is fine if you are less than 25 feet away from your light truss and you are only using a standard 10 foot truss . I now have the ability to use two light trees and they don't have to be right next to my DJ booth . A great investment to my company . Also this was one of the few places I could find 50 foot lengths where the cable was black in color too . Not grey or tan , because that always looks classy in a DJ setup . Not ! One of the better prices I found as well . Keep up the good work !  
2	  Purchased this for watching TV on my computer . Was not interested in the recording features , and have not yet tried . Selected Hauppauge because of the more favorable reviews than other brands . Also decided on the PCI card instead of a USB device because of reviews indicating lesser picture quality with the USB devices . Have a Windows Vista machine and it runs great on Media Center . Also works with WinTV software provided . Installation and setup was easy . Was watching TV within about 20 mins of opening the box . Picture quality is very good . On the negative side , the tuner card failed after several weeks of use . However , Amazon was great about sending out a new unit . Was up and running again within 5 days . Overall , pleased with the product and the support from Amazon . Note there are many variants of this product . I got this one because it ran on Media Center and had a remote . Would not buy without the remote .  
2	  I bought this reader to transfer pictures from my 10Mp digital camera that uses SD card . The installation of the SW that came with the reader was a snap . After you plug in the reader , it displays 4 removable drive in my computer . When you plug in the SD card , the installed SW will automatically start on Windows XP . The transfer speed is excellent . It transferred 85 MB worth of files in 13 seconds = 6.5 MB / sec . There is only one minor issue to point out . The USB cable included with the device is a bit short . I wound up buying an USB extension cable . But the reader does provide an extra cable ( very short ) so you can take the reader with you .  
1	  Had mine for 6 months . It is already broke and the connection is slow . One of the white antenna 's is flopping around , it will not screw on tightly again . Oh well . I guess I will have to buy the apple product .  
1	  The Street Atlas USA 2007 ( SA2007 ) user interface is proprietary to DeLorme and not intuitive to Windows users . I also have Street Atlas 7 ( SA7 ) and , even though it is also proprietary , I find it easier to use . The streets in SA2007 are from the same old database used in Garmin 's 1999 Road & Rec MapSource CD . In some areas , including Lake Tahoe , streets are significantly inaccurate . This was discovered by uploading GPS tracks to a PC and observing how well they matched roads on various maps . On newer maps excluding SA2007 the match was near perfect . On SA2007 and Garmin Roads & Rec the error was up to 350 ft . I have several DeLorme products and must say I am disappointed with SA2007 . I have uninstalled it from my PC and gone back to SA7 .  
1	  Having bought this in Jan . 2010 , I hooked it up to my computer to make sure the software and maps were up to date . So what do you get for a list price of $ 600 ? One update . After that , you have to pay $ 70 to update your map to the newest version . They also have an option for lifetime updates at another ridiculous price . I 'm sorry , but this is pure greed . Not only are you paying an ultra-premium price on their GPS , but then you have to keep on paying just to keep the maps up to date . Mine came installed with the 2009 north America city navigator . I got one update to the 2009 only to discover there was now a 2011 version . Can I get that one ? Nope . They want more money . I will never recommend this product to anyone based on this disgusting abuse of company greed . And make no mistake , this is not an easy product to use . You can't look up a city by zip code , so you 're stuck spelling it out , and the settings go on forever . Trying to find places to eat I uploaded was painful since they were not in a place you would think they are . All in all , for something to get you from A to B , this product falls far short of a $ 600 price tag . Garmin may not think so , but that is a lot of money . And then to request more money just to get the latest map ? Pure greed . UPDATE 1-26-12 : The latest maps now allow you to look up a city by zip code . Whether it was done via a software update or by the 2011 map itself , it 's a welcome change . My rating still stays the same since I had to pay for this no-brainer feature .  
1	  Printer did not work out of the box . After spending an hour with Lexmark tech support , they agreed to send a new one ( which I think was a more current model ) . The new printer arrived quickly and was extremely difficult to set up on a wireless network . Printing wirelessly via my mac book provided to be very flakey and required constant tinkering . Lexmark tech support said the problem was related to the wireless drivers not working well with Leopard . After about two months wireless printing stopped working altogether . About two months after that , USB printing also stopped working . I guess I got my money 's worth getting four months of usage for a $ 40 printer , but definitely not worth the aggravation .  
1	  My purposes for the 7060 is to play MP3 CD music via my FM radio in my 2002 SUV . I want to play my home made CD 's that give me + 10hrs of my music . I ordered it taking a risk making the assumption that Coby 7060 would have common-sense controls . I now know why Colby never respond to my web site queries and why they do not have the 7060 listed on their web site . Answers to my questions have now been discovered : FM TX only has four preset frequencies 88.1 , 88.3 , 88.5 , 88.7 ; if you have a near strong station you will get interference . They should have added four 107 MHz frequencies if they insisted on presets . Plus the head phones run off the same FM TX ( not IR as implied ) so you get loud ear pops with near strong station interference . Confirmed - FM TX has barely 6'distance ; the audio has raspy highs . Still unknown what the battery is ; Lithium or NiCad . What is alarming is only 300 recharges before degradation can be expected . No MSDS label on the battery for proper disposal . There are NO controls for R / L audio balance or bass / treble ! No super bass or enhanced audio modes . The controls are NOT back-lite for night vehicle or in-the-dark use . The BIG BLUNDER of the 7060 as a CD / MP3 music player is there are >>NO<< " random " or " shuffle " modes - this really sucks making it nearly worthless as a music player ! Needless to say I 'm disappointed in the 7060 but I 'm more disappointed in Coby for the lack of sales information baiting us into purchasing a substandard device that doesn't meet the established bare-minimum common-sense industry standards .  
1	  I purchased this adaptor to replace my missing Apple iPod charger . I needed a charger that I could use internationally , and this one specified an input voltage of 90-246V . The USB end of the dock connecter plugs into the charger ( so you can charge other USB-connected device ) . It worked in the US and in India , but it did seem to electrify the metal on the iPod . It 's not enough to really harm you , but I was concerned about the effects on the iPod 's internals . I was able to adjust the dock connector until it barely connected to the iPod , at which point the metal was no longer electrified , but still charged the iPod . I know it wasn't a faulty dock connector , because it worked fine when connected to my computer .  
2	  GREAT PRODUCT , heres why .. if you did your research the battery life on this is nice , wireless internet and the size itself means you can carry this anywhere . I thought the screen may be too small since I work with a 20 inch imac at home , but its fine when you 're on the bus / subway or coffee shop ( its a laptop ! carry it and have fun ) . Small hardrive , but get a external for a few more bucks or burn them on the cd burner it offers . Upgrade the RAM to 1gb + ( kingston ) , and get a nice pair of earphones , the sound is great from earphones ( sony ) .. If this is not your primary computer then this is the right size for you . This is a great price for its size and most needs , especially if you 're a first or second year college student . JUST REMEMBER TO GET A PERFECT FITTING SLEEVE OR CARRYING CASE ( incase 12inch slim sleeve ) , or you 'll get tiny buffer scratches on the first day like me .. The reason this got a 4star is because you need to upgrade ram if you 're doing graphics work and a perfect fitting sleeve , both which needs a little searching , and its not on amazon ..  
2	  This product is a great deal . 25 DVD DL discs for 30.00 bucks with a respectable name . I have not had a single bad one in my spindle yet . Great Deal will buy again .  
1	  I feel bad that money was wasted on this product . I have the new tiny square Nano , 6th generation . The directions to sync , begin run , stop run , set type of exercise , calories burned , distance covered etc . all require you to go to Nike + iPod on the Nano , then to SETTINGS . The new Nano does not have a SETTINGS field . I 've been trying to figure out a way to start this thing , especially since I went out and bought the Nike + shoes , which weren't cheap . The good news is that the built in pedometer in the Nano works with the Nike + iPod site , so at least it records how many steps I take each day . So if that 's all you need , don't bother buying the Sport Kit or the shoes . The pedometer works with any shoes or none at all .  
2	  This is used as a sheet protector for geneology papers . They work excellently as a way to preserve old letters , news clippings and typed pieces . I want to order more .  
1	  I purchased the Koss QZ-5 Headphones . THESE ARE NOT ACTIVE NOISE CANCELLING HEADPHONES ! I was duped . I believed these were active noise cancelling headphones , but they reduce noise by adding a ton of padding . These headphones are HUGE . The picture displayed is very decieving , only showing you the profile of the headphones . If you wear it and look in a mirror , you will look like a geeky mickey mouse . They stick out of the sides of your head making you look like a weirdo . In addition to that , the sound quality is extremely poor . At the moment I am listening to the Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack , and any bass makes the headphones crackle . Bass performance is absolutely poor . Do not get these headphones , they are a waste of money . Do not get these headphones !  
2	  I wanted a boombox to play cds and tapes while I exercise , I can use it while I am riding my stationary bike , or walking my treadmill . It 's just what I wanted . Perfect for me . Sounds good , easy to use and light to carry to different locations . Small enough for a small table . Perfect .  
2	  The products are good and i would say a must buy for people with new ipod ..  
2	  The cable signal to our house was very strained and , at times , quite poor . What pushed me over the top was when Time Warner added a few new HD channels and all that I could access was the banner on the bottom of the screen , no picture . Good luck in trying to get TW to do anything about it without charging for additional equipment . After a ton of research , I purchased this signal booster from Amazon ( at 1/2 of the price of CircuitCity ) , installed it at the point of entry for the cable to my home and , voila , magic . The signal was strong on all TV 's and there was a substantial improvement in the picture on my HD set . Way to go Motorola !  
2	  Very handy camera bag . Made by Canon . Several handy accessories and compartments . I definitely recommend this bag .  
2	  I could not program my VCR but this is easy to program . I have now finally gotten rid of ALL of the other remotes . I am buying one for my 79 year old mother . I saw it at a friends house or I might not have believed it works . Expensive but well worth it .  
2	  This arm band works very good , but the arm extension is difficult to attached and use . You could have two diffetent options , or improve the arm extension .  
2	  I recently made a purchase of infinity primus 362 speakers from amazon but was really getting them from electronics expo . To my surprise the infinity 362 were on sale for 149.00 dollars . But , this is when it gets better i recieved my speakers , but they were infinity 363 the newer and more expensive version of the primus line . Enclosed was a letter from electonics expo saying due to the overwhelming demand of the infinity 362 there were no more left so they gave me the infinity 363 at the same cost of the 362 . I just want to say that electronics expo came through for me in a big way oh yeah the speakers are great good sound and very durable .. Thank you ELECTRONICS EXPO !  
1	  I bought this Tv on 3/7/07 for my sons 3rd birthday his whole room is done in the cars , now almost exactly one year to the date it has started turning off on its own , my son now doesn't want to sleep in his own room because he thinks someone is in there turning off his tv . He can't understand this is just a piece of junk tv . And after spending so much money on this room and tv and trips to Disney you would think they would stand behind there product .  
1	  I live in a major metro area and the radio stations I listen to are major stations , so it is usually very easy to pick up signal for them . This thing couldn't do it . It got nothing but static .  
1	  The stap that COMES WITH THE CASE , is sewn on - and as I walked around the 1st day with my new camera in it - the little leather piece that held the strap to the case - broke away and the camera fell to the floor - luckily the camera did not breaK . CASIO DID NOT APPEAR VERY INMTERESTED WHEN I CALLED AND COMPLAINED !  
1	  I have encountered the blank page problems , which are annoying but fixable . The thing that sent me over the edge was the fact that the paper feed stopped working . Understand , this printer has had extremely light use , so there 's no good reason for a hardware failure at this early stage of ownership . I wish I 'd read these reviews before I bought it , but now I know . Epson , say goodbye to another customer .  
2	  Heavy cable , solid connectors . Cable covering smells of cheap plastic out of box , so let it sit out for a couple days to burn off the smell before stowing away .  
2	  Short and simple surge protectors are a dime a dozen but RFI surge protectors are not so easy to find . In my home town no one sells one so I ordered from a vendor via Amazon . com . It arrived as advertised quick delivery and a Longg cord . Did it reduce my computer hash etc . on the sound system radio ? Yes , all gone . So much of the stuff we buy these days is RF hash filthy and this RFI surge protector does offer a noticeable degree of isolation - 15 to - 30 db . simple as that . The FCC allows anything goes these days . This is my second unit the other is on my Ham radio equipment - same good results . Now I can have my radios and PC on at the same time . Of course that is metal case PCs / radios with 3 prong ( case is ground ) AC plug .  
2	  Ipods / music / photos / audiobooks / etc , done deal , no question , so let 's talk video . It 's easy to load onto pod once you 've procured appropriate video-to-ipod suite software , although it does take some time . Given the limitations of small screen ( 2.5 " ) , the end product is pretty good , although I 've found dark / black scenes can distort . The real problem for me is battery duration . You 'll only get approx 2 hrs viewing time out of unit , and this is drastically decreased if you overuse fastforward / rewind function . To combat this , I use a Griffin * TuneJuice * , a power pack containing a 9v battery which attaches via the dock . Of course , for overseas trips , I also carry extra 9v batteries just in case . Having experienced this type of portable video capabilty for the first time , I 'm starting to think the ipod doesn't offer enough , and I 'm thinking of more dedicated machines such as the Archos 500 or Cowon A2 - bigger screens , longer battery life etc - or perhaps I 'll wait until Apple bring out their full-screen , turned-on-side , virtual clickwheel model ! In the meantime , I 'll make do with the ipod .  
2	  I purchased this Trackman and also the Marble Mouse because I began experiencing numbness , dull pain and fatigue on my right hand due to constant typing and a not so ergonomic mouse . Since I 'm not a doctor , I can't characterize my issue as carpal tunnel . Anyway , this mouse definitely reduced the pain and after a few weeks of being mindful , the pain virtually went away . I thank this mouse in large part . It 's comfortable , it fits on most average sized hands and it works really well . The ball does take time to get used to but it is very convenient once you do . The only qualms I have is this mouse doesn't have additional buttons that can be programmed . I think you could have two additional buttons bellow the ball .  
2	  Let me preface by saying that nobody is going to be buying $ 20 headphones for serious studio work . So the 9 ft cord is utterly silly . These are for wearing while you walk from one place to another or while riding public transportation or doing other things , for people like myself who don't like things going inside the ear . The cord is obnoxious because if you don't have somewhere to put it , it 'll drag on the ground and you or other people will trip on it . For most things , it 's not a big deal ; I stuff the extra cord into my backpack where I keep my mp3 player . At the gym , it 's more of a problem because there 's nowhere to put it . For the price , these are great . Some people complain about how they don't keep exterior sound out . This is a good thing . Like I said , these are not for studio use at $ 20 . This is for casual listening . When you are walking on the street , it 's important to be able to hear what 's going on around you . They 're also very comfortable . Everything that touches your ears or head is well-padded . I 've had many other cheap headphones that put the hard plastic directly on the top of the head .  
2	  This is a surprising small yet full of addreses . The only problem is that infrequently it gives the directions as if you are coming from the opposit direction  
1	  I bought the refurb version of this player , and am sorry that I did . The tray on the first one wouldn't close all the way . The second one ( yea , silly me .. ) wouldn't play , and the turntable wouldn't turn . Both times , this was right out of the box . I 'm out $ 30 for having to ship these back . I guess that I 'll have to repair my 15 year old Sony .  
2	  My new BEL Vector 955 radar detector is working well and has already saved me a couple of tickets . Range is excellent on highway up to a mile . Some false laser signals in city . Auto mute is a nice function & each frequency has it 's own audio alert . I have always been happy with BEL radar detectors & I 'm pleased with this one .  
2	  I bought these headphones as a birthday gift for myself . I did a lot of research , mainly using [ .. ] cnet . com as a reference . I had a pair of Sony MDR-V600 's for about 10 years . They still rock but I wanted something new and fresh . Then I discovered Sennheiser , a name I had never heard of before . Ratings for all products were through the roof , so I decided on the HD 280 Professional set . I 'm blown away . Music , movies , you name it come in crystal clear and booming bass . Comfort is quite nice and they really block out any external noise . Given the high quality ( German of course ! ) the price point was perfect . They even sound amazing when hooked up to your iPod or iAnything . I HIGHLY recommend buying these either for yourself or a music lover . You won't be disappointed ! I love them so much , I plan on getting my dad a pair of Sennheiser HD 380 Pro Collapsible High-End Headphone for Professional Monitoring Use ( Black ) for Father 's Day .  
1	  The image quality of this camera was not so great to begin with . To make things worst Kensington stopped supporting this camera a while ago and doesn't provide XP drivers so now as I upgraded to XP the camera is simply useless . Save your money and stay away from Kesington .  
2	  Great product at a great price . It comes from Washington State and I am in the midwest so it took a long time to reach me but it was worth the wait .  
2	  I was glad that I could purchase this drive , since my current computer does not have a ZIP Drive and I have 15 Zip Discs .  
1	  CAME TO ME DRY , NO INK , BUT MERCHANT , GAVE ME A FULL REFUND , NINUS THE RETURN SHIPPING , WHICH I FEEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO ME , I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER , BECAUSE OF THIS FACT , I FEEL THAT HE SHOULD HAVE REFUNNED MY SHIPPING MONEY  
1	  I bought this product as a gift for some friends - following the directions carefully , they were only able to get one of the speakers to work and that intermittantly - after I got the speaker system back from them , I gave it a try - bad results , worse this time - only static from one speaker - I double checked to make sure that I had installed everything correctly including making sure that the correct power adapters were attached to the speakers - no go - and , then , when I went to return it to the company from whom I bought it in Canada , I got the royal run around - finally after lots of phone calls and mail issues ( don't get me started on " customs " issues ) I returned the product and got the price of the speakers back - however , no refund on shipping either way which amounted to about $ 89 total - so .. two things : [ 1 ] the product is shabby and not worth the price ( go to Sharper Image and buy theirs - better product , cheaper price ) and [ 2 ] never buy anything from Amazon . com that is not from an American supplier .  
1	  I decided to try this , since my car stereo doesn't have a cassette deck or auxiliary input , and I wanted to listen to my iPod holdings in the car . I should have listened to other reviewers : This is WORTHLESS in Los Angeles . There are basically NO open frequencies on the dial , and the sound was garbage when it did transmit . I 'm returning it , and planning to either have a mechanic install an auxiliary cable or have an electronics retailer install a stereo with an auxiliary input .  
1	  CONS : Blurry Photos and Indistinguishable ZoomThis camera was a breeze to get setup and become completely familiar with all features , I did not mind that this camera does not have many features , but the one feature I miss is focus . I am returning this camera because of the poor quality of photo . The LCD shows a great shot , but the computer and television show a different quality . I am going to spend the few extra dollars and get a good camera .  
2	  I purchased this headset for use with Yahoo Instant Messenger with Voice . It was at a reasonable price and it works as I was able to speak to the other person and I heard them clearly , so I 'm satisfied , but it was a bit tricky to adjust the microphone so that it didn't brush against my mouth as I was speaking . Can't seem to quite get it to fit snuggly on my head .  
1	  I had brought these speakers to be disappointed , the LED in the speakers didnt work at all . I sent them back for a replacement and those didnt work as well . I had to contact the Pyle company to find out that the speakers LED only works if you have a amp hooked to them or have enough watts to work them . I wouldnt have bought these if the site would have said that in the first place . The site says when they are in use the LED would work .  
1	  Bought a pair of these a month ago . Good sound but after using them 6 times the right earphone slides up and down the post without gripping . Primitive design . Wish I hadn't bought them . Sent note off to Grado . NO response . Buyer beware .  
1	  Been using the SC101 off and on since May of 2008 and all I can say is - NOT WORTH IT ! I saw the negative reviews but bought anyway since it was reasonably priced . Even with a Seagate Barracuda 7200rpm drive with 16mb cache it is still very slow . However , thats not the real issue here . Serious and frustrating problem is it will routinely disappear from the network without rhyme or reason . Has dropped out of sight even after just using it and going back to save a document . The only thing that will bring it back is always a reboot of the router , and sometimes a reboot of the PC also needed . Its always the router first , that usually does it . If not the PC needs to be rebooted also and it will appear again . I downloaded twice the latest firmware as the web site recommended but to no avail . NetGear has no solution . Shame on NetGear for releasing this device .  
2	  I first bought it six months ago for connecting my xbox . Impressed with the quality and bought one more for HD satellite connection .  
1	  Pro stick duo SDs for the PSP can be bought at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 gigs and probably higher and they 're all generally under 20 dollars . The only thing this piece of junk is worth is to save game data . The PSP holds videos , music , entire downloaded games from PSP network , etc . I suppose if this was a dollar with free shipping I might suggest it for someone who only wanted to play games on their PSP . Don't bother , these things shouldn't even exist anymore at this data size .  
1	  I ordered these headphones expecting Sennheisers smooth sound and comfortable fit . Needless to say I did not achieve either . I read the reviews here and as I know headphone reviews are very subjective I gave them a try . I happen to own a pair of Sennheisers right now-a very old set that isn't produced anymore . I wanted an upgrade . When I first received the phones I tried them immediately and I was shocked at how harsh they sounded . I forgave the fact that they were crushing my head since I felt I would be able to adjust them somewhat . Not so . I tried stretching them apart without breaking them but it didn't help much . Since reading many reviews here suggesting breaking them in sound-wise I played a few CD 's on an endless loop for many hours a day . To be honest they did improve somewhat . However , I didn't feel like waiting a month to decide whether they would improve enough to warrant the expense and I returned them . I suggest these headphones for those with smallish heads , those who like a somewhat harsh , powerful sound , and those who don't like bass at all . I am not a big fan of booming bass but I could not detect any bass whatsoever from these phones , which is odd for a closed ear headphone . I gave them 2 stars , even though i considered giving them 1 star , because they seem to be built quite well and headphones are very subjective as you can tell by the differing reviews here . But what the heck , Amazon will take them back if you don't like them so tight fit , harsh sound , and lack of bass notwithstanding , give ' em a shot if you think they are up your alley .  
2	  I use this in a place where I can't run an ethernet cable and have a weak WiFi signal because of multiple walls between my router and PC . Installation of the Powerline Ethernet Adapter was a snap - just plug one into the router and a plug , and the other ( which you have to buy separately - so you need 2 ) into a plug and your PC ethernet port , and you are good to go . Couldn't have been easier . Maximum throughput in my home ( built ~ 1985 ) was about 300 kbps .  
2	  I have tried them all and when I stumbled upon the review of these Coby 's ( that was my first reservation - who 's heard of this name brand ) I thought what the heck I can part with 6 bucks to give em a try . Long story short Im getting rid of all my other headphones - sonys , phillips etc . and ordering five more pair for my computer , portable dvd , mp3 . These are nothing short of magnificent - The more I listen to these the more I just laugh because for the price they feel and sounds like some ultra expensive headphone that some rich guy subsidized and slapped a generic name on just to get some kicks - I will never use another headphone again .  
2	  This product worked great and was the right price . It was the original equipment for my device so I plugged it in , charged it , and it is working great !  
1	  I bought this for my fiance , and while it worked , we were both very happy with the size and quality of pictures . But then the day came , less than a year after buying it , that it decided to stop working . Very frustrating , and it seems like we are not the only ones .  
1	  It would have been nice to know that this product was not suited for the newer Stiletto 2 . The case while constructed out of a nice soft material , is too big for the Stiletto 2 as the cutout for the wheel does not line-up properly . The biggest complaint is that there is no cutout on the right side of the case ( as you look at it ) for the on / off slider , so you must remove the unit from the case to turn it on or off . Could have been a really good product , but not worth the $ 30 .  
2	  I had recently got a new 15 " MacBook Pro ( which I LOVE btw ! ) and wanted a sleeve to go with it so that I could put it in my backpack without it getting beaten around or scratched . I searched around Amazon and other websites looking at reviews and I decided to try this one since I had read that Marware designed good products for Apple in one of the reviews I came across . A few days later it arrived in the mail and I am definitely a satisfied customer . It fits my MBP snuggly and is lined with padding so if you drop it while its in the case it should survive the crash ( though I wouldn't purposefully drop it to test it out ! ) . The blue strip on the outside has a nice pocket that snuggly fits my iPod Touch . Definitely glad I bought this product .  
2	  A solid , decent waterproof unit , though pricey in today 's competitive high-tech market for a simple radio  
2	  I used this earlier version of the sony " Psyc " walkman a LOT while it was still working . It lasted nearly a year with no problems . Then my dog jumped up at me unexpectedly and got her claws caught in the wires . The walkman smashed down onto the floor . The buttons on the player itself stopped responding . Fortunately I could still use the so-called " Remote control " . But then I snagged the wire on a doorknob and destroyed that as well . I think I would pay extra to have a wireless version of this product .  
2	  This keyboard combo actually works better than most other wireless keyboard / mouse combos I have tried at any price . At the low price I paid , an amazing value . Highly recommended .  
1	  The keyboard and mouse worked for a while , but then it lost the mouse . Efforts to re-connect proved fruitless ( tried the recommended methods as well as switching batteries , ports , computers ) . Nothing would re-establish the wireless link . It only lasted a couple of weeks .  
2	  I have owned this camera for about 3 months and I am very happy with it . It takes great shots and is easy to operate . The menu is easy to work through and covers everything . Using the max resolution , I have been able to print a 8x10 photo with good results . The only problem I have found is taking pictures in a low light situation . The camera has a difficult time focusing in the auto-focus mode . Overall for the price [ $ ] at the local store I am very pleased .  
2	  The mic is a little scetchy at times , choosing to actually NOT pick up my voice when I am not being a little loud . Great sound in the speakers though .  
1	  I wish I had read the reviews first . They are dead on ! The wire is very thin , maybe 18-20 gauge . Also the protective jacket is purple . I had to put my project on hold and re-order larger wire for car stereo install .  
2	  This Tenba backpack has pretty much everything you 'd ever need want . - A three stage tripod system that successfully holds all sizes of tripods comfortable . - A full harness that supports more than enough weight comfortably for long treks . - A built in protective wrapper for the harness when it isn't needed . - A weather wrap that stashes into the bottom of the bag when not in use . - Plenty of room inside , both deep and well placed with thick dividers and padding . - A large laptop compartment that stashes into the padded camera case . - Removable camera padding , so the bag can be used as a normal backpack ( this is awesome ) . - Weather preventive exterior and zippers . - Handles on both the top and the side for easy carrying . - Quick access to the bottom left and right camera equipment from the outside . - Bottom strap for attaching extreme items like a roll-up blanket or monopod . Like I said .. it is engineered for EVERYTHING . The Costs ? - Weight . She ain't light . - Size . Being extremely deep , and wide , this is not a slim urban profile backpack . That 's about it . It 's a great backpack with amazing quality standards . Worth the price tag .  
1	  SO FAR THIER IS NO NUMBER FOR SUPPOERT , PIECES ARE MISSING THE SPEAKERS DON'T WORK AND THE STANDS ARE CROOKED .  
2	  Love the Creative Zen ! For the money , you cannot beat the value . Excellent battery life , and easy to get to the battery if you had to . No need to send back to the company like an iPod , which my daughter has .  
1	  After going throught the igo site I thought that I could buy the igo juice to power my notebook , a cell phone and a personal organizer . I was wrong . Firstly , although I used their configurator tool , it mistakenly told me that I could buy the juice and use it . E mailing technical support , I found out I need a lot more wattage than this product supplies . Nor would it power my other electronic products that should have been compatible . My laptop needs about 120W , the best they have tops out at 90W.Also some of the parts do not connect together . Be warned that their web site is a horror to navigate around , technical support on the site is extremely limited and the FAQ are a rehash of other pages . If you want a list of the products available you cannot get there without navigating through the configurator again .  
2	  Got this for my dad and he loves it . Darn near half the price from the bose headphones and I literally see little difference . I got these because I went to CES ( Consumer Electronic Show ) and continually went booth to booth trying on several headsets and these were one of the most comfortable and affordable . Noise-canceling is good , but the person next to you on a plane more than hear everything . Overall , great product .  
2	  I 'm using this in my basement with an older PC so that it will have internet wi-fi access and it works great !  
2	  I got this for aSlik Professional Universal Deluxe Tripod with 3-Way Panhead and Panoramic Photo Guide ; could have got the smaller model but didn't want to risk it . This looks really slick , all walls are heavily padded , there 's a small compartment inside secured with velcro , a good sized external compartment with a zipper for random accessories and a small " window " to put your card or tag in . There 's double stitching throughout and a few rivets - very professional . All that is lacking is for the tripod to go " mmh - cozy ! " . There 's still plenty of room for other random photography paraphernalia besides the tripod , such as aCanon Monopod 100 for SLR Cameras & Lenses , and aFM Photography McClamp , 26 " Long Flexible Articulated Arm with Micro Clamp and 2 " Clamp # 3302 .  
2	  We get excellent reception with this antenna in my attic in Atlanta metro area . No need for amplifier at all . Face the antenna to south . Thread a 75 feet RG6 cable from attic to basement and split it with two 2050Mhz signal splitters for six TVs . All TVs get excellent and strong signals for over 60 channels . Enjoying the Off the Air broadcast without the cable bill . Great antenna .  
1	  The price has dropped quite a bit since I bought this . I liked it for the built in mic and iPod pause / advance button ( it functioned just like the set Apple gives you ) . The ear pieces were comfortable but mine just stopped working . There is a loose connection in the mic / pause button .  
2	  Good cables for good price . Works good . 9 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 8 @ # H KL  
1	  I ordered this item because of the way it is designed . The speakers are angled to aim forward in the ear to give better sound . I had headphones made by Aiwa a few years ago designed like this and they sounded great and were comfortable . I couldn't find any other maker of this type of design anymore . That 's too bad because these headphones by Sennheiser sound pretty good , but the ear pieces are a little too big to fit comfortably and the strong springiness of the neck band causes them to press in too much , further adding to the discomfort . In addition , the wire is coiled so tightly in the package that is stays permanently coiled and tends to kink and catch on things all the time . I ended up returning them for a refund .  
2	  Over all this product is very nice It does work as stated as long as you have a high speed conection . BUT check to see if it 's compatiable with your tv , cable box , fta receiver , etc . The on screen remote control that is used in the slingbox software did not support my equiptment . Although tech support was very fast to reach , and in enghish I must add they were very aware of incompatable remote issues . With no resolve . I had to search out a third party remote program to resolve my issue . But it did not control all the functions of my origanal remote but did the job .  
1	  Worked for a week and then keep getting " card not ready " error . Tried putting in and out , rebotting .. DOES NOT WORK . I wish I could get a refund .  
2	  I gave this telescope as a gift to my son 's girlfriend . She is very happy with it . I would recommend it for a beginner .  
1	  I was a little too tempted by the price and shouldn't be surprised it didn't last more than two months . It works fine while it works but is very fragile . Considering the price it 's what you should expect .  
1	  I brought this camera for my bithday and I had a blast with it . The pictures were great and everything . It was even used for my school newspaper ! But unfortunatrely it does this glitchy thing while taking a picture and sometimes in order to take a see your pictures you have to take a picture first . The camera freezes a lot meaning you have to shut it down manually which is bad for the camera . I don't recommend this camera unless you have a rechargeable pack of PATIENCE !  
1	  When I saw this laptop bag in the store , I was excited to finally find a stylish laptop bag . I bought it to use it for carrying my travel laptop to conferences . Three months ( 4 conferences and at most 14 days of use ) later , the first strap broke and I almost dropped my laptop on the marble floor . The chique design is unfortunately not enough to cover the lousy quality .  
2	  I created a dark green and white Hello Kitty Cheerleader logo in photoshop then added GO PACK . Printed it out , ironed it on to a dark mustard yellow tshirt - looks fantastic no see thru in the white parts . I 've washed it four times no fading ! My kids are dying to make shirts of their own ( that will get a little expnsive )  
1	  I got this GPS after reading the good reviews on Amazon . However , so far the unit has proven to be a big disappointment . For me , the biggest problem with this GPS is that it doesn't give the best directions for getting to destinations . I 've tested it on a few places that I knew how to get to , and about 50 % of the time it told me to take routes that are simply out of the way ( some are so obviously wrong , leaving me wonder how in the world they came up with the direction ) . Sometimes it would announce that I 've arrived at the destination when I haven't yet reached the building . I live in a well populated area that has been developed for quite some time , so there is no excuse for the incorrect information . Because of the wrong directions I 've got so far on places that I 'm familiar with , I don't feel like I can trust this GPS to take me to a place that I haven't been to before . Before I leave for a new destination , I still have to get the directions from Yahoo or Mapquest to use in conjunction with the GPS , so I can make sure that this little gadget doesn't take me on a wrong or longer route . Other things that annoy me are the voice prompt ( it says to " keep left " on the freeways and streets when it simply means not to be in the right lane , and the repeating prompts sound " nagging " after a while ) and the lack of the text to speech feature . The trip planning feature also isn't very user friendly . Overall , I 'm not satisfied with this GPS .  
2	  I just purchased this item and have not had any problems with it locking up . I loaded 55 pictures into the internal memory and it says that I can load 17 more . Each of my photos is 1.5m to 2m taken with a 4 mega pixal camera . When I purchased this I didn't realize that it had any internal memory and thought that it simply ran off a memory card . This does appear to be possible as well . Although the first time I inserted a memory card , it just started loading pictures into memory , the next time I put in the memory card ( with new pictures ) it started running the slide show directly from the card . I had to select and download the pictures from the card and then remove the card to run from the internal memory . Image quality is very good , maybe not as crisp as a 4x6 print by very close . As others have stated , the frame does stand very upright , I didn't think that this impacted the ability to view the image clearly .  
1	  U3 works on some machines and not others . The support from Sandisk is canned and didn't help . The expectation seems to be that the user will either reconfigure the computer they are using ( kinda defeats the purpose of having software on your flashdrive so that you don't mess with different computers ) or you will uninstall U3 ( then why pay extra for it ? ) . This was a waste of money .  
2	  Seemed a bit hard to program but , it is simple to install and works great ! . The cost of a Sears unit was $ 55.00 .  
1	  Worked well for ~ 5 years ( this is the model with the large power brick ) , then melted down and destroyed 8 batteries last night . Fortunately , I woke up to the hissing and popping sounds and disconnected the power before it burned my house down . I hope the newer model I have doesn't suffer the same fate .  
1	  This is the second of this particular camera I have used , and despite the small led screen , it is handy to get a shot in close quarters . unfortunately the camera stopped working within 2 weeks . It seems likely that the wiring in the swivel joint may be the problem . I was foolish to buy a used camera . tao  
2	  Good cheep audio cable . No static or distortion in the sound . Connected it to my sound bar and my laptop . Sounds great .  
2	  used it for about six month now and it 's been great . did i mention the 1000:1 contrast ratio looks amazing ? the contrast ratio on this monitor beats any dell lcds that i have used at work . this is simply a good investment that keeps on giving . check out the specs , you can turn this lcd into a Tv in an instance . good luck and have fun .  
2	  i had this dvd player for a month and its been working just fine . but whene i bought this dvd player . it didn , t come with a headrest bag . i would love if someone could tell me if it comes with it . Because i went to coby . com and it says it comes with a headrest . but on amazon . com it says it dosen't . well if someone could write something . THANKS  
2	  I brought this for my cable box that is behind the LCD above the fireplace . It worked like it promised . Just recharge the batteries for 24 hours before installation . Put the RF battery in your remote , plug this baby up and you 're in business . I could change the channel from my son 's room upstairs . My wife was impressed . Saved me $ 300.00 by not hiring a professional . Buy it you won't be sorry .  
2	  I bought this headset to use with a Panasonic cordless phone . From the very positive reviews here , I guess I expected a bit too much . Pros : The sound quality is very good . You can hear the calling party very well , and the other end says the voice is very clear . Cons : I use a Plantronics headset at work that costs much more , and compared to that , this one feels very cheap . The soft plastic on the earpiece makes the ear very warm . The stem to the mouthpiece feels thick and clunky . The cable wire is ( comparatively ) hard and stiff . But for the price , it 's a steal . However , if you plan on using the headset for extended periods each day ( I don't ) , you might want to consider something better . For home or occasional use , this is good enough .  
2	  I bought this product as a gift , and i know for a fact that she still uses it to this day . good product . would recommend to others . cheers .  
1	  I purchased two of these from BuyXtras both arrived slightly deformed / warped . I had to bend them a little to get them to match the proper 40mm fan , and even still they look kind of mis-formed , with that said , I later found a place on line to get these for 60cents each ( mouser ) , ordered from that re-seller and all where perfectly shaped . This is too simple of a product to mess up , the original seller knew quite well that they were sending me , what I would guess to be factory rejects , at an inflated premium price .  
1	  My DRT400 worked beautifully for one day . Then , on day two , its front panel said " WELCOME " and that is where it stayed . Humax tech support was unable to help , so they are sending me a new unit ( while putting a $ 400 hold on my credit card . ) It will arrive in 5 to 7 business days . That is NOT my idea of good customer service . It is also INSANE to require the use of a land line telephone connection ( which I do not have ) when the unit contains networking components . It SHOULD offer to connect to WiFi right out of the box !  
2	  I have been relatively happy with the Fuji FinePix F20 . It takes pretty darn good pictures , especially in low light . I don't have anything to add about the camera 's features that haven't been posted already , but I can give you a heads up on how they honor their warranties . About 6 months ago , my lens got stuck and the lens cover came off . No big deal . The camera still worked . Then , about a month ago it went completely dead . No big deal , I 'm still under warranty . I went by the book , called for an RMA , and sent it in to their Edison , NJ repair center . About two weeks later I got a bill for over 75 % the cost of replacing the camera . The estimate description reeks of a company trying to sidestep their warranty obligations . So , I call them . I soon reach the typical I Deal With Angry People On The Phone All Day Every Day rep , and end up in one of those conversations where you are presumed guilty before you 're even heard . Eventually , I am put on hold , and in the meantime apparently " the manager " has decided to give me leniency and cut the repair bill down to about 50 % the cost of replacing the camera [ mind you I never spoke to " the manager " and quite frankly if I were to find out it was one of those Seinfeld conversations where you 're put on hold for a few minutes while someone has a fake conversation with " the manager " I wouldn't be the least bit surprised ] . Some things to bear in mind , 1 . I am a lifelong photography hobbyist , and did not abuse this camera in any way2 . I packed it six ways from Sunday so that there could be no disputes with the USPS3 . I was the only one using the camera , so I know that it didn't happen into the wrong hands when the defect occurred . 4 . IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY ! I like Fuji 's cameras , despite the stupid xD cards and I have enjoyed owning this camera . I don't know if any of the other manufacturers are any better about honoring their warranties , but HELL wouldn't it be refreshing if a company simply honored their warranty without argument or question ? There are companies out there who do that . Fuji is categorically NOT one of them . I am not exaggerating when I state that I will not buy another Fuji camera EVER , simply on account of this experience . In fact , I am in the market for a digital camera as a gift this holiday season , and I will go with Canon or Sony or anybody else . They might be just as bad , but now it 's personal .  
2	  Been trying to get this at amazon for a while since it comes in and out of stock very quickly . Lucky this time I was able to get it in mid-May and was delivered within 6 days via super saver shipping . I bought this MP3 for myself not to resell it . Since this is my first MP3 player I have nothing to compare it to , but from using it the past two weeks I can say I 'm very satisfied with it . I have about a Gig of music and audio books on it already . Getting the Mp3s to the Muvo are so easy , just drag and drop and there you have it , you don't need their software if you WinXP as your OS . The battery life is awsome I have yet to see it drop even one bar during the time I have used it . I would have liked the case to have been aluminum instead of the cheap plastic . Pros : - long battery life - small form factor - 4GB memory - great sound from the supplied headphonesCons : - small screen , they could have made it a little bigger - carrying case covers the controls for the player , must take out the Muvo to use them - out of stock often - buyers that mistakenly buy this for $ 50 then complain they got ripped off because the 4GB drive is missing . READ THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT YOU 'RE BUYING ! Nice product and get it while you can before it goes out of stock again .  
1	  The Palm m125 is my first PDA and I 've had it for about a month . I spent the first week or so learning to use the features and software that came with the product so I could take full advantage of it 's capabilities . After this period of time I put it into actual use and find that it has both pluses and minuses . On the plus side the inbuilt features and software bundle that came with the Palm work well and as designed . There also seems to be a great deal of software available to suit most anyones needs . The support that I 've needed from Palm has been professional , timely and helpful whether it be via email or over the phone . On the minus side the screen is very small and somewhat hard to read as compared others PDA 's that I 've looked at more recently . The stylus is also not as sturdy or as large as some others and in my opinion not as easy to use . What troubles me most about the m125 is that I constantly have to re-sync it with my laptop as it looses all data at least once a day . It seems to be very sensative to the position of the batteries in the unit . While holding the unit in my right hand , three fingers across the back of the unit ( where the batteries are ) and my thumb on the front , the slightest pressure to the unit with my thumb over the to-do-list button causes the unit to turn off and either perform a soft boot , hard boot in which case all data is lost or just a complete refuseal to turn back on until I open the battery panel on the back and re-position the batteries . Because of this problem I find I 'm better of using the scraps of paper and my laptop as I have in the past for my organizational and information needs .  
1	  I have used this lens on a Sony W-7 and have found the centers of the photos to be sharp and the edges of the photos to be out of focus . It might be a good lens but not for the W-7 ? I use all the Sony lenses on this same camera without any problems .  
1	  I purchased this for a MacBook pro , it read my 1G card just fine , but when I insert my 2G SanDisk SD card it detected the card but failed to mount the FAT32 partition making it useless with this card . I have had no problem using this same card with a USB reader on Windows or Mac . The Belkin web site did not have any support suggestions  
1	  This is a pretty camera to look at . It is small and compact . The problem that I find with the camera is that it does not like darkness , and the flash most of the time over-powers the subject . I found that you had to really read the book and understand the features of the camera before you could take some what of a nice picture . Only 3 out of 10 pictures that I take would I consider good quality . Other than that , my 1.3 megapixel sony 3.5 floppy camera takes just as good pictures . I don't recommend this camera .  
1	  The sound these speakers put out is pretty decent for the price , though nothing special . The real problem , however , is feedback . Not only are there loud pops and clicks , but they constantly pick up radio frequencies . As long as the speakers are on and the volume is low , you will hear various radio broadcasts in myriad languages ( sometimes more than one at a time ) , and if you turn the volume up to avoid this , you get the pops and clicks . The voices made me curious at first , then it was kind of amusing . Now it 's flat out annoying . This seems to be a frequent problem with Logitech speakers in general , not just this model . The Mp3 player dock is certainly nice , but does not outweigh the annoyance of the incessant feedback . Even for such a low price , these speakers are not worth it .  
1	  I don't know if it is because I live in a large city with very few available frequencies .. but the quality of sound sucks . No problem if listening to book .. but for music it 's not worth it at all . A tip for those who buy this : Setup is confusing if you use iTunes .. you just need to copy the ipod files to your PC and manually add them to your playlist . In the end , I just spent $ 200 at Al & Ed 's autosound and put a pioneer sterio into my car that accepts an auxilary input from an iPod . Well worth it .  
1	  I love the content , but that 's not what I 'm reviewing here . This unit is shoddy and extremely fragile . I 've already had to replace the antenna and the power jack , which both frayed or broke through gentle , normal use . And now , the the power jack is starting to jiggle again , losing power if the radio is moved at all . It 's especially annoying - the power doesn't just cut out - the radio takes a moment to come back online and find the signal , so it cuts out for a WHILE .  
2	  another great priced sony product on amazon .. great shipping , fast friendly .. and really easy to operate .  
2	  The Zune is a great product . Its standard Wifi separates itself from the pack . Also , FM is standard unlike some of its competitors . It does feel bigger then some other players out there ( because it is ! ) but that shouldn't matter . Most people put their players on their belt , in their pocket , etc . The extra " girth " makes it feel a bit more solid . Plus , the benefits of the bigger size ( larger LCD screen for video ) is worth it . ProsExceptional sound . The best I 've listened to yet . Exceptional video quality . The larger screen matters . Trust me . Scratchless and fingerprintless bodyWifi which , today , you can transfer songs to a friendWifi , which , tomorrow , will hopefully bring more functionalitySeamless integration with Xbox 360Decent ear buds that fold up nicelySoftware and on-line storeConsNo bells and whistlesNo equalizer ( hopefully , this will change via a firmware upgrade ) Songs you transfer to a friend can only be played 3 times / last 3 daysNo video downloads from website at launch ( not a problem for me )  
1	  I bought this peace of trash because I thought I would be able to get a better signal-range and 108 MB transfer rate in my two-bedroom apartment ( using with Netgear desktop-PCI card ) but I all get was very low signal sometimes or nothing .. Mann , my neighbor uses a Belkin-Router and I am able to get an excellent signal . It seems to me that almost always Netgear likes to be first to bring new technology , but cheap + crappy , to the market . If it is a new technology and it is made by Netgear don't buy from them AND JUST WAIT , please wait , I am sure Linksys , D-Link or Belkin would probably make something better than Netgear . Furthermore , WPA never worked .. For technical-support , talked someone from India , who I thought just wasted my time . Disastrous -N E T G E A R = I DO NOT RECOMMENDED IT  
1	  Modem works o . k . Good luck luck getting your rebate though . They cheated me out of mine and the modem is not worth the non-rebate price .  
2	  I gave one of these to my daughter when it was clear the Sony videocam I had given her earlier was not seeing any use . Immediately the films of grand-daughter demonstrating her latest ballet moves started arriving via e-mail-good enough to motivate me to get my own Flip , even though ( or especially because ) I 'd never used my Panasonic videocam . Like a Canon Elph , the Flip fits in a pocket , but it 's less complicated and more user-friendly . The image quality , moreover , is quite satisfying if your primary interest is in capturing some of those moments that are otherwise lost . The good : 1 . The convenient the pull-out arm means no missing USB connector when you need it . 2 . Good image and sound when camera is plugged into composite inputs on a TV set ( admittedly lousy audio from the camera itself ) . 3 . The company is so determined to make things easy , the camera comes with batteries installed . Such attention to user-friendliness characterizes everything about this camera and its save and edit program . You can send low-res clips over e-mail , save hi-res clips to your computer , select snap-shots with a simple click and then drag them as Jpegs to iPhoto ( I 'm using a Mac ) . Edit movies in iPhoto or use Flip 's editing program , which is similar to that of Roxio Toast ( permits trimming the beginning and end of a scene ) . 4 . On a Macbook a 30-minute film opened on the desktop in 30 seconds . Saving it to a higher resolution required 2 minutes . 5 . The lens is capable of capturing viewable images even in near-dark conditions . Things to be careful about : 1 . The zoom lens button is so close to the start and stop trigger that it 's quite easy to activate the unintended feature ( compose your shot , then forget the zoom ) . 2 . The lightness of the camera makes it very susceptible to camera shake . ( Keep your shots short and resist the temptation to zoom in and out . ) 3 . There is no viewfinder and the camera 's screen washes out when shooting outside in bright conditions . 4 . The delete button is so accessible that a 2-year-old can lose all your footage with two clicks ( it was poor judgment on my part to let her play with the camera ) . 5 . Very few instructions come with the camera , but they 're not needed . Flip dumbs it down to practically any point and shooter 's level . Which Flip ? There are some demonstrations comparing this Flip with the newer model ( Ultra Flip ) on Youtube . It soon becomes clear that there is no improvement in image quality when using the newer , more expensive model . And since I have little interest in editing and have an accessible laptop , I figured that 30 minutes would be all the time I would require from the camera . If you choose your shots resourcefully , half an hour is enough to capture an entire wedding-from ceremony through reception . Think like Hitchcock-keep the shots short in duration and make them count .  
2	  We purchased this DVD player 4 years ago for my 3 year old before we went on vacation . I got an unbelievable deal and figured that it would probably only last the duration of our trip . To my surprise , it is still alive and ticking . It is used everytime we go anywhere in the car ! What a great product . It is compact , so it is easily slipped into a large purse . Our only issue has been finding a new power cord for it . Ours broke a few days ago and we are having difficulty finding something to replace it .  
1	  It sounds nice to pay .. for an item that could save hundreds in replacement costs . One problem , it does not really work that well and it is a pain to use . It will clean . It might fix some scratches , but clearly not all of them . Also , you hand will get tired while using it because the mechanism runs sloowly .  
1	  This may be a fine 2 channel preamp but I believe calling it a 5.1 ( Apparently it weighs 5.1 pounds ) is deceptive ! Buyer Beware ! This will not function as a home theater preamp .  
1	  This product could have been very good . The problem is that it seems it was never tested before release and the firmware was never finished . The " power on / off " button doesn't even work . You can't complain to Netgear as the support site email trouble reporting doesn't work either . Half of the remote control functions are non-functional . The only way I can turn it off after use is to unplug the power cord , then when I plug it back in , it powers itself up , then the power button works to turn it off . Seem to be literally hundreds of bugs in the original firmware and there is no sign of an update release . The strange thing is that the tough stuff works ( WiFi , PC library interface , etc ) and the simple stuff fails . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS NETGEAR FIXES THE FIRMWARE .  
1	  Having used for almost 2 years the printer failed and wont print anymore . From what I can gather , the purge unit or waste ink pads are faulty or need cleaning . Cost to fix is more than the MP390 price , so my advice is to stay clear of all Canon printers really . I used HP and Epson all my PC life ( 20 years ) and found no problems with these , what a mistake it was buying this Canon MP390 .. they know about it as well , as they have been discontinued . Many people swear by Canon and some even SWEAR AT THEM ! .. I am the latter . They much slower and quality no where near as good as HP and Epson .. Other brands not sure of .. Again .. stay clear of these .. Carl  
1	  This product worked great .. until I changed the battery . After I put a new battery in , the player would barely even come back on . It does this EVERY time I change that battery . I put a new battery in it yesterday and of course it didn't come on right away but after trying and trying to make it work , it still won't come on . I will not buy another sandisk mp3 .  
2	  Overall , this is a great router .. I have had some issues with the firmware , just like every other router I have owned ( from any manufacturer ) .. Yet , this unit is exceptionally stable and reliable .. Here are some comments that may not be in the mfg specPro 's + Speed is great , clocked 90mb from one wireless laptop to router to another wireless laptop ( wireless N ) + IP Reservation system - allows you to assign an IP to a device / client , while allowing them to still utilize DHCP + Dynamic DNS support through d-link or dydns + Webapp makes all of the set-up functions and administration a breeze + allows you to save a profile of all of your settings in case the router needs to be replaced or wipedCon's - Signal strength / range .. okay .. I purchased the optional antenna system and it seems to help a little .. - Tech support is slow and farmed out overseas - Firmware has several minor bugs , which are annoying until you learn to live with them .. - No central place on the webapp that shows all the connected clients ( sometimes they dont come up at all )  
1	  Logitech makes superior products and the ones that I own have performed well over time , except for this remote . After four years of use , buttons that control DVD playback have failed . It is a physical problem . . . the contacts under the buttons started to lose connection and slowly deteriorated to make the unit useless . This is an expensive remote , and there is no excuse for a product of this type and design , used exclusively in an adult-only household , to fail from its physical design and construction . As with most consumer items , repair will likely cost as much as I paid for the remote , new . The alternative is to discard it into the global Himalayas of electronic device garbage . Totally unacceptable .  
2	  Excellent , Good , Fair , Reasonable , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah , Blah .  
2	  The delivery was afst and the software is easy to use . I am very happy with this purchase .  
1	  This is a very poorly designed case , and I would encourage you to look at alternatives before spending your money . The problems I have with the case are : 1 . The palm does not fit snuggly inside the case and tends to rattle around . I had to glue a piece of foam inside the front cover to stop the rattle . 2 . You cannot get the stylist out , even when the case it open . The edge of the back cover blocks you access to the stylist , so that you must balance the palm between the front and back to retrieve the stylist . Very , very annoying . 3 . The case muffles alarms so that they cannot be heard . I 've just missed another appointment , so I 'm going out tonight and buying a new case with slots for the speaker .  
1	  I bought this item , and first off this supplier ( it 's not Amazon ) shows you a picture of a brand new HP product . Read the entire print of your purchase , it 's refurbished , not new . Marketing of this type is deceptive since many people associate their purchase with a visual of the item - in my book deception is a lie . I will not buy from this supplier again . Second problem occurred after I put in the black ink cartridge . Similar to other reviewer ( s ) here , it flat out did not work . I wasted a lot of my color cartridge trying to clean the cartridges , re-clean , prime , test , clean again .. it 's broke . Just simply don't buy this garbage , do yourself a favor and buy a brand new HP product packaged from the company itself . It will be 100 % reliable .  
2	  I compared many 32 LCD TV 's and the Panasonic LX600 has the best picture quality . I compared LG , Sharp , and Samsung and the Panasonic has the best color and angle viewing . It 's a little more expensive than some other 32 inch models but for the price you get a better product . Only disapointment is that Panasonic doesn't offer a 37 in model . This unit has 3000:1 contrast ratio , 8ms refresh , and 500 brightness . The stand allows for the tv to be moved side to side which is a nice feature . The speakers are on the bottom so the tv fits in tight place where some 32 lcds have the speakers on the side which increases the size of the tv . If there is any complaint , its that the remote feel cheap . Not bad , but just kind of inexpensive . Overall , I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a 32inch LCD .  
1	  I bought this router based on some excellent reviews that I read online . However , my experience with this router was all bad . It did not play nice with my Mac Book Pro . It was always having a hard time establishing a connection with the router . It worked okay once I turned off Ipv6 on my Mac Book , but I had to do a ton of troubleshooting to find that solution . Even then it still had intermittent connection issues . Then on day 3 , the router died completely . No power , no lights , no data , nothing . I tried a couple of different outlets to make sure it wasn't a bad socket . It wasn't . The router just died . I would not recommend this router to anyone , and I 'll be looking at other options for a replacement .  
2	  i needed another HDMI cord so that i didnt have to keep switching the one i already had between my xbox and ps3 , so i bought this . it works perfectly , i would reccomend this to anyone looking for an HDMI cable .  
2	  First off , let me say that I have never owned an Apple Ipod before I received this 30 GB white video . Of course , Amazon 's service was very satisfying , I received the Ipod in four days and it was great . Now I am not an Apple hater , I like all of the systems but I have to say that I was highly disappointed with this item , with the exception of the first three weeks . I had just taken the Ipod out of my computer from charging to leave my house . When looking at the artists , I noticed that only about half of the artists that I had on my Ipod were being shown , I ignored it . Pretty soon when I played a song , no information from the song showed up , not the song title , album , artist , or the little picture . I called Apple and one of their people put me through a few steps and told me when I was done , everything should be okay , after I was done with what I was told to do , my computer did not even respond to the Ipod . I called Amazon and was sent a replacement using one day mail ( very good service , loved it ) . I received the new Ipod and tried to turn it on , THE REPLACEMENT DID NOT WORK , I got this little exclamation point and the Ipod did not turn on , even after hours of charging , as I was suggested to do . I was not happy receiving a replacement for a defective $ 300 Ipod that turned out to be defective also . Called Amazon again and was told that they would refund me fully and I could order another one if I wished , at that point , with the quality of the Ipod , returning it and getting my money back sounded good . I then found out that the Apple Store will replace any defective Ipods , I took it there and they ran tests on the replacement and gave me a new Ipod ( more quality service ) . This Ipod appears to be working . The good - The sound of the Ipod is so clear , it is not even funny , I could shake it as hard as I could and it would still come out perfect . The videos , great , they come in just as clear as the music . The battery seems to be working well , I have not tested it but can tell I am getting 10 hours at the very least on a full charge . Overall , if this Ipod keeps working , I do not think that I will ever leave my Ipod behind , whether it is a 30 second walk to the bathroom or seven hour day at high school , it 's great to have . The bad - Beside what I said in the paragraph above with the replacement , there is not a lot of bad . It would be nice to be able to plug Ipod into the wall ( adapter costs extra ) but it is not to much of a hassle . I heard that the Ipod scratches easy , I did not take a chance , bought cases right away , the Ipod I had for three weeks , not a scratch on it , I would recommend Amazon 's product Speck Products 30 GB iPod Video See-Thru Hard Case 3-Pack ( Clear , Black , Red ) for case protection . Service from Apple Store and Amazon was superb .  
1	  This was my first very owned headset , when i first used it , i was pretty satisfied . the sound was good . the next day i tried it , nothing worked and i was hearing a static when i touched the remote . my technical guess is that the wire shorted in the giant remote , and truthfully , the wire and the remote felt kinda flimsy . There was a review about the same problem i read on this site and i figured whats the chances that all the same problem is going to occur to me , especially from microsoft , god damn i was terribly wrong , punished for 2 weeks without a headphone because i decided to go with a brand name which i thought i could trust . dont let the same thing happen to you  
1	  If you have Clear as your internet provider don't even bother buying this . It will mess up your connection within a week , it works for like thirty minutes and it will stall after that . It literally took twenty minutes to log me into facebook . Just spend a little more money on a higher tech version .  
1	  It was OK while it lasted , other than my PDA ( Dell Axim x51v ) having to be restarted every now and then to recognize the drive . It stopped working after 20 months . With Flash drives so cheap now , I would avoid this type of drive .  
1	  For those of us with an archaic camera , there is no choice but to purchase the adapter - thank you Sony . Well , my camera was working fine until I put this thing in and now it won't accept it nor any other stick , not even the old ones . I have since read online that it 's a common problem and some cameras end up ruined . Hmm , it would be nice if the manufacturer of this piece of junk replaced my camera , or if Sony came out with a solution to the problem they caused in the first place .  
2	  Excellent reception on my end , and the folks on the other end always say I sound loud and clear . What more could you want ? Oh yeah , it 's very comfortable too ! Believe me , I 've tried lots of headsets , and the quality on this Panny set blows away every other one I 've tried - and the price / value ratio is just off the charts . I just ordered my sixth set . I use them on my home cordless phones and on my cellphones . I 've given a couple away to friends , like the gideons give away bibles - because I 'm a true believer ! I keep two in the house ( one for each cordless phone - makes for some awesome conference calls ) and one in the car for the cellphone , and one for a spare just in case , because I don't want to live without them ! Honestly , I 'd gladly pay $ 40 for a set this quality . To get it at this price makes me believe that all may be right in the universe after all .  
2	  This is my first Sigma lens and I was a bit nervous when ordered it . But I was pleasantly surprised with the build quality and sharpness of this lens . I experienced no AF problems . This lens AF as good as any of my Canon lens . It is very usable at f1.4 and becomes extremely sharp if you step it down a couple of steps . The 30mm works extremely well on a crop frame body especially indoors where there is simply not enough room to step back to fit everything in . Oh yeah , I love the fact that it comes with a matching finish hood !  
1	  I bought this memory and it works fine . I sent the rebate to PNY and they sent a postcard stating " missing receipt " I did send a copy of the transaction but there is not a " receipt " included in a online transaction .  
2	  I held off on buying these for a while since they were so inexpensive , I couldn't imagine they worked all that well . Instead , I read some reviews and got the Sennheiser PXC 250 , which fold fantastically small for travel with good noise reduction . Big problem though : they are " on-the-ear " phones , and very uncomfortable for long periods since they push your ears into your head . I fly cross-country and internationally quite a bit , and I found I couldn't wear them for longer than 2 hours without actual pain . Noise reduction and sound quality are useless if I can't even wear the headphones ! So comfort became my # 1 criteria . I demoed the Bose Quietcomfort 3s , and they are very nice , but there 's no way I was going to spend $ 300-350 on headphones . I finally bought these , immediately put them on and wore them for over an hour , and they are incredibly comfortable for me . Noise reduction seems decent , and sound quality is good if a bit boomy on the bass . Amazon was $ 12 cheaper than Target . Very happy and difficult to beat for the price . Anyone want some PXC 250s ? :) Pros : Extremely comfortable for long periodsBattery stored inside headphone itself vs . dongle or boxBattery and airline adapters includedCons : On / Off switch hard to activate , especially when onA little bulky for airplane travel  
1	  I bought this MP3 player as a xmas gift for my sister after comparing characteristics and price vs other brands . It worked for 3 days and then just died . We have tried all the troubleshooting we can think of / have been suggested and nothing has workedI 'm trying to get a replacement or a refund from sandiskThis failure adds to all the ones I 've had with flashdrives ( 512 kb and 2 GB ) I WON'T BUY ANOTHER SANDISK PRODUCT EVER ! Save yourselves all the trouble and frustration and look for other brands .  
2	  I received the Belkin F8N044-BRN CushTop Notebook Stand ( Chocolate / Blue ) in time for the holiday , as promised , to give as present to my niece . Good service .  
1	  I wasted a lot of money on this piece of junk . I have yet to fix one single cd , dvd or video game disc with this . I even gave it the benefit of the doubt and bought a replacement wheel in order to fix a few video game dvd 's and all of them were failures . The scratches weren't even deep . They were just superficial ones . Take my advice and save a whole lot of time and money . It 's one of those things that on paper seems like it would work but it does not work .  
2	  This is my third reVOlutions iSkin eVo2 since purchasing my iPod Photo 30 GB many years ago . I originally bought this skin to protect the finish of my iPod from scratches but now like it for the clip on the back which allows me to wear it on my pants waist for walking the dog or doing household chores . I gave it four stars because , as I stated earlier , I have had to buy three . My previous two ( one pink , one black ) both had the same problem , necessitating a new purchase : the plastic clip on the back broke . Now , it is possible to purchase a replacement clip , but when the replacement clip is more than the price of a new skin , I opt to just buy a whole new skin . I have researched other products and in the end I keep coming back to this brand , despite the cheap clip . As I said , my iPod is one of the dinosaurs from years ago so I guess when you consider how much I use my iPod / wear the clip and the years I 've had it , the product overall is pretty good . That said , I still think they could put a stronger plastic clip on this skin or use metal or some other material to avoid the problem altogether . Aside from the plastic clip problems , the case will attract pet hair or dust , but that is to be expected as it is made out of a silicone material that naturally attracts such items . It is easy to put on the skin and to take it off . The hard , plastic viewing window is nice and sturdy and protects the screen well .  
2	  Love this navigation system , it has all the features that I need and more . Great built and extremely easy to use . Highly recommend the sd card , gives you the flexibility of loading as much or as little as you want . The 128 MB that came with it has been enough for me at the moment . I live in NJ and traveled to Boston this week , took it with me , excellent gadget to have . The only reason I did not give it 5 stars it 's that it sometimes looses the satelite signal in cities with tall buildings and sometimes it may take some time to aquire the satelites . It doesn't bother me too much .  
1	  i wanted this device to work and it did have the potential .. positive was the ease of interfacing with my mac . big problem was imputing data either via the touch screen ( non-responsive or incorrect response ) or character recognition . backlighting was also very poor . would try another model if these problems were solved .  
2	  I 've had no problems with this cable . Do NOT overpay for HDMI cables , brands and high-priced models won't perform any better than cheaper cables . I 'd recommend these cables .  
1	  the seller never hade the item he was selling tuck my money i called and was told the item just came in 7 was being shipped after 2 weeks i called the maker and was told this item has bin made in over 10 years  
2	  This flexible tripod is perfect for holding your camera steady and in a fixed position . The " legs " of the tripod are extremely flexible and go back into a straight position quite easily . This tripod also has a belt / shirt clip on it ! Which makes taking this little guy around places a breeze . I use this with my Kodak Zx3 Playsport . I recommend getting this .  
1	  This panasonic DMR-E75S is a nice item , but beware it may only last for about a year before it turns out to be a surprise package and the owner 's manual booklet can be better too . I also must alert you that the customer care center by phone sucks just like a straw , nothing like a recording telling you that the waiting time for your call to get answer is about 55 minutes and will be answer in the order it came in and all that BS . Give it a year or so then it becomes a surprise package .  
1	  Pircewise it 's OK .. delivery was just awful ! I wouldn't purchase from the seller I got it unless It 's a MUST  
2	  I needed a fax machine that was economical and could not only fax , but could copy . This is a small and easy to use machine that I highly recommend .  
1	  I liked the Canon 620P for the nice sleek , slim size . Installing the software was a breeze , no problems expect a registry problem which I corrected because Canoscan CD didn't detect a PDF program on my thinkpad .

1	  I am not sure what happened with so many positive reviews , but my experience was not a good one . The buffer style side of the pen worked wonderful , the first time . When I went to use it a week later it was greasy , it just smeared the stuff around leaving an oily residue , not to mention it didn't clean the edge of the lens where some of the oil was shoved to in the process of " cleaning " . I am not really sure what went wrong in one week . I didn't have it out of my camera bag between using it the first time and then the second time . The oily residue could be fixed using normal methods . Worse than the oily residue , the brush turned my camera into a walking electrical field . I couldn't prevent the dust from collecting every time I changed the lens . I admitted defeat and brought my camera in to be professionally cleaned because I could not get all the dust off . I asked them about the best thing they had for cleaning it , thinking of course they would sell me something . They told me the best thing is a simple soft cotton cloth and the fog from breathing on it . I knew this , but I always thought there might be a better / safer way to get it clean . _ Edit : I was sent a new " pen " . The customer service is excellent , but the pen still was NOT . I had the pen sitting in my closet for about a month because I knew I wasn't that impressed with it the first time around . I took it out today and used it before a visit to a local state park . After using the pen the camera lens was perfect ( before stepping outside of the car ) . I spent 1 hour at the park . It was hot and the humidity was high , probably a bit of dust in the air . When I got back into the car I looked at my lens and it was full of a greasy film . It reminded me of the oil from a car with the rainbow effect EXCEPT it was on my $ 500 camera lens . After trying for a short time on the way home with a soft cloth to remove the oil I still did not remove all the film off from the lens . I am very frustrated because I just seem to be smearing it around more or leaving a greasy scratch . I am quite mad at myself for doing this to my lens again .  
1	  THIS IS THE WORST PRODUCT I 'VE EVER BOUGHT ! IT 'S OLD , IT DOESNT WORK PROPERLY . THE AD SAID NEW , IT WASNT NEW AT ALL . NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE . I 'LL NEVER TRUST THIS VENDER AGAIN .  
2	  I bought this filter to protect the fabulous Fujinon lens on my X100 . While I was sold on the idea of getting some basic cover for the front element and cutting visible haze , I was concerned that a cheaper filter would degrade optical performance with flare and non-parallel glass elements . I needed the promise of precision manufacturing , good glass and high performance coatings to feel confident about putting this on a favorite camera . This filter is heavy in the hand and appears really well built . It screws on and off the lens easily with no binding . Images taken before and after the filter show no degradation . Job done - wallet lighter !  
1	  I was very disappointed in this product .. I can hardly hear anything through them .. Volume is REAL low .. Not worth the money I paid for them .. The cheap set of headphones I paid $ 5.00 for has more sound then these do ..  
2	  This box works great and you can't beat the price . I deducted one star because instead of the color being your typical cream color as pictured , mine came in a pea green color . For me , it 's really not an issue but for others it might be a big disappointment . I use it to disconnect from the internet while working on video rendering . When I 'm done , I simply switch it back on .  
2	  I was a bit skeptical about this set of 5.1 speakers with so many 5-star reviews . I 've owned 5.1 Logitech speakers before . They were OK . They worked fine and did their job , but were just OK . I was looking at this X-540 system to replace those old 5.1 Logitechs which I accidentally broke . The price on these was good and I figured that they probably couldn't be worse than my previous ones , so I gave them a try . I 'm very impressed . VERY impressed . These are easily two or three times as good as my previous Logitechs . They actually have a slight amount of unmistakable fidelity in there . The woofer has been completely redesigned from the old model and has rather respectable , non-distorted bass . The satellites sound more clearly . The woofer and satellites integrate very well together and the 360 degree envelope is pretty convincing . For the money , I 'm very impressed and satisfied . These are a great deal and perform very well in a PC gaming rig , which is what I bought them for . These are obviously not going to best a real hi-fi system ( i.e. Conrad Johnson or McIntosh gear driving Dynaudio or Quad speakers ) for true musical fidelity . But these speakers really stand apart from the rest of your system and make you take note as they are just such a good performer . Well done , Logitech .  
2	  works well on 3 pcs ( 2 XP desktops & 1 Vista laptop ) . still working after 6 months .  
1	  What 's in this , about 1 oz of ink ? You go through these like bottled water . I guess its obvious why Epson doesn't have clear ink containers like the knock offs - you'ld see it was almost empty when you bought it .  
1	  I purchased this HP 78XL ink cartridge from amazon in August of 2010 as a back up for my printer , since I had just inserted my last on-hand cartridge into my printer . The expiration date on the box reads " Sep 2011 " . Today I put it in my HP printer to replace the existing one since the color printing had started looking bad . However , when the " test " sheet printed out there was no yellow ink showing . And this , 6 months prior to the printed expiration date . I realize the amazon " return " date has elapsed , but when a cartridge doesn't perform at least up to it 's expiration date , to me it means the cartridge is defective . HP 78XL - Print cartridge - 1 x yellow , cyan , magenta - 970 pagesI feel that due to the circumstances , this cartridge should be replaced by the supplier .  
2	  Well , I reserve one star for me , because the material seem to get dirty easily due to the fabric texture and the color ; besides that the case is perfectly desingned and fits the camera and maybe a pair of extra batteries or sd card in its poket .  
2	  This machine has been stable and durable . The screen is bright and crisp . Not a single pixel has died . A 2.8 ghz Pentium IV processor and 333 mhz system bus ( approximately ) is pretty darned fast for a laptop , if what you need is pure , raw speed . Slower dual-core processors probably won't keep up with this machine . ( And remember that few applications are written to take advantage of dual core CPUs . ) That 's what I needed . I got it for use with Dragon Naturally Speaking , which is about the most CPU-hogging application in widespread use . The machine is fast enough for Dragon . The sound chip is adequate for Dragon , though possibly not ideal . I can run Dragon and MS Word simultaneously , without any serious problems , though the CPU strains a little to keep up at times . This machine is heavy and somewhat bulky . The fat Pentium processor drains the battery fast . You might get 90 minutes out of it , or a bit more , if you set the power management savings to their most conservative , don't use the DVD , and turn off the wireless . Use the battery less conservatively and you 'll get more like an hour . If you don't need this kind of CPU horsepower , you 'll probably prefer a lighter machine with longer battery life . If you need to crunch some heavy numbers in real time , this might be the machine for you .  
2	  I like this speaker , the voice is nice and the quality is good , even I turn to very loud still sounds great .. However , if you want your speaker has lots of fancy functions , this one might not fit your request ; otherwise , this is a great product you should think of .  
1	  Worked for about two weeks then nothing . Checked both ends for good connection but still no power through it . Put my old one back on that I use on my motorcycle and device works fine . So I put the new back in and wiggled the plug end of the wire and was able to get power if I held the wire to one side . Junk !  
1	  This mini tripod is a pretty good basic design , but to work in practice I had to cut a couple of inches off the center post and swap out the head for a decent ball head . The plastic pan head is simply not strong enough to hold anything but a point and shoot . Certainly not a D800 . The head 's main problem is the plastic hinge that allows the camera to be rotated into vertical . It 's supposed to be an additional feature but makes the head so " floppy " that at best you can only shoot static shots : forget panning or tilting during a video take . It 's also very difficult to level the horizon . That hinge again . It simply can't be tightened enough to hold the camera level . The suction cup on the center post is supposed to attach to a flat surface , but the surface has to be perfect to work . Not likely . The cup deteriorated after a couple of years , too , becoming superfluous . Worse , with the legs retracted to their shortest ( and most stable ) position the center post has to be extended upwards . Now the camera is really top heavy and , again , the whole thing is unstable . I speak from trying to shoot video clips in Washington DC , where you aren't allowed to use a full-sized tripod . So I carried this little guy , setting it on domed trash receptacles or benches . Those domes together with That excessively long center post made it almost impossible to use . It wasn't up to the job . I came home and shortened the center post , removed the pan head and replaced it with a sturdy ball head . Still can't really pan , but can at least level the horizon . I 'd recommend a different setup . After I got done cutting the center post and adding aGiottos MH1302-655 Professional Calibrated Ball Head with MH 655 Quick ReleaseI should have gotten theSUNPAK MINI-PROPLUS / B Mini Tripod with Compact Ballhead .  
1	  Bought this GPS , which came with an outdated 2006 map . When trying to update , we were informed by LG that we needed to purchase a new map for $ 100 . Again , this came preinstalled with an OLD map and now they want us to purchase . All other companies allow you to download the new maps for free . DO NOT , DO NOT buy an LG GPS ! Do not buy an LG products .  
1	  I have been using this headset for a few months now as well as my officemate . The earpeice is not the most comfortable but is fine for short periods of time . The biggest complaint is that it picks up ALL noises . We have had multiple complaints that we can hear other people talking and even dogs barking in the neighborhood .  
2	  .. I used the lens at a wedding and it was just perfect . It 's a little tough on the focusing and the zoom but that 's ok at least I know it 's going to stay put . I can't wait to use it on my digital SLR and see how it looks .  
2	  When amazon gives u a date that they r going to deliver , it comes on that day or sooner . I brougt sony speakers an I love them , They just need a little more watt to them . They r hard wood an a very shiny look to them . Thanks Amazon .  
1	  I bought this off the shelf and really haven't had any reception problems .. Worked fine in LA , and Portland ( where I now live ) has such a high terrestrial backup that I can pickup stations inside the house without having the antenna near a window .. The problems are with the boombox .. As someone stated earlier , it is all bass .. if your listening to rap , it sounds great , but if you 're listening to talk , sometimes its hard to understand because there is so much bass ( there are no tone controls ) .. The volume control is in steps which means you can't twist a dial and get the volume you want - you have to jump in steps . You really can't get a low volume ( I listen at night before I go to bed ) because of this step volume - its either on or off at low volumes .. Now the boombox is starting to make this chirping sound .. a small electrical chirp about every second .. if the volume is high enough its drowned out , but at low volumes you can hear it .. that flaw is in the boombox and not the radio because it doesn't do it in the car .. in fact , the boombox will make noises when the radio is off .. One way to get around all of this is ( if you have purchased the boombox ) is to get another radio and use the FM transmitter .. The receiver is great and sounds good in the car , but avoid the boombox unless you like high bass , loud music ..  
2	  I just got this item after reading just some of the confusing reviews and other positive ones . It was inexpensive and worth the buy . Upon getting it I unplugged by Logitech webcam and plugged in the targus . I then plugged in mouse , digi camer and webcam and it worked as smooth as silk . It is most recommended ! Works great !  
2	  I have a T61p that I just installed a newWestern Digital 320 GB Scorpio Black SATA 7200 RPM 16 MB Cache Bulk / OEM Notebook Hard Drive WD3200BEKT [ Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging ] into the laptop , so had the old 200GB lying around . I noticed this , and thinking that I don't really use my Multi-Burner all the time , that this would be a cheap way of having both drives in the machine at the same time . Installation was super simple , the bay just holds the drive in a clip , so no screws required , and it is hot-swappable with Windows 7 , ENT that I am running on the machine . I have installed Ubuntu 9.10 on it and it dual boots nicely with Windows . A great addition to an older laptop ..  
1	  How can a company that has historically made so many great products make such a total piece of junk ? I have had this CD recorder for a year and a half . It is currently at a repair shop in the hope that they can fix the CD loading tray from constantly jamming and eating CDs . I 'm not holding my breath because the folks at Pioneer are totally uncooperative about fixing the problem . I may have to throw away this [ $ ] piece of , ahem , equipment because it simply won't work and I can't get it fixed . Whatever you do , don't buy a Pioneer CD player or recorder . If you 're like me , you 've had many other good Pioneer products and might be tempted to buy something like this from them . If you do , you 'll regret it . Run away as fast as you can .  
2	  If you need a 15 foot extension cable for yourkeyboard or mouse , then this one should work just fine . My key strokes are going through it right now as I type this review :-)  
2	  Lemme confess first that I am a complete novice in the line of SLR photography .. but definitely wanted to cross the point and shoot . After a lotta looking around and some suggestions from mah friends , I decided to go for Nikon D40 . And man what a camera , which compelled me to write a review on the first day itself . I can't really give you more technical details , but I can definitely tell you , if you are starting or planning to get into some nice photography , this can be and is one of the best option . The very first day I got the camera delivered , my photos wondered me .. I never knew that I can click photos like those .. all kudos to the the machine .. a 5 star for sure  
1	  Right out of the box , the factory mouse would not work , no matter what I did . So , I tried a Microsoft Intelimouse ; that didn't work either . Then , I tried a Logitec cordless mouse , which worked ! I then attempted a drive image of the C drive . I tried to use Memorex CD-RW media , but that didn't work . I then tried CompUSA CD-RW media of the same specifications , and that did work . I hate to think where I would be if I hadn't tried these fixes . This is not inspiring for a brand new computer . My only consolation is that the computer was dirt cheap for what appears to be good features . Nothing else appears to be wrong with it , so far . If you buy it , I hope you have better luck than I did .  
2	  Great value for the price . I needed text-to-speech so I would not have to take my eyes off the road . This gps works great . I only wish that the volume could be made to go louder than it does as I don't think it can be heard clearly over the car radio .  
2	  I have purchased three of these routers and help install them for people that need simple and reliable WIFI systems in their home . The router is a workhorse that provides reliable and solid performance for years . The device works on the 2.4 GHz band and is fully programmable . It offers 11 USA Channels for wireless transmission so you select the most open channel to get the best coverage and least interference . It also provides 10 and 100 MBPS wired ports for your local Ethernet devices to connect to . It supports WEP security and the more secure WPA2 and Wireless Mac Filtering to prevent hackers from using your WIFI . Its data transmission speed is up to 54Mbps at a transmitting signal power of 18dBm ( 28 mW ) . Its user interface software is easy to use but could be intimidating to a novice to WIFI systems . One of the great features of this device is that so many have been sold and proven reliable that Open Source DD-WRT firmware is available to upgrade this device to a higher level of performance at no additional cost . One system I installed used two of these routers and installing the DD-WRT firmware allowed me to boost the transmitting power from the default 28 mW to 71 mW ( I could have even gone higher ) which is a solid performance enhancement . In addition I was able to install a second WRT54GL unit as an AP by connecting two units together using a hard wired Ethernet cable and basically doubling the WIFI area of coverage for a larger home . You have to do a little program changing in the AP unit but the data is available on the Internet , just look for it . Being able to do firmware modifications and improving performance makes this router a good buy . The upgrade to the DD-WRT firmware will void your warranty but enhance the performance and is well worth the time to do it . Just follow the instructions carefully and all will be OK.I did subtract one star as this router is rather old in design and does not have the newer N-Band at 5 GHz . The N-Band brings higher data transmission speed , up to 300 Mbps , and allows the concurrent use of two bands to improve throughput in the WIFI system . It is also very good for streaming movies and large amounts of data but 2.4 GHz will do it also , just slower . Newer routers can also offer 1 Gigabit wired Ethernet and USB ports for sharing printers and hard drives . These are things to consider when buying your next wireless router . If you are looking for a good stable router that can be enhanced then this one is a solid choice !  
1	  I'ts funny how you HAVE to give one star in your reviews ! This does NOT deserve a star period ! Like many others on here , I have had nothing but problems with this unit ! It will NOT play any cd 's at all . I bought this new from Amazon and will never buy another Onkyo brand product again . Oh , and Amazon sent me another unit , and guess what ? Same problem . Do NOT but this product !  
1	  I never take time to review products but this one deserves my time . It looks like the reviews in this page refer to a different product and not to the one I received from Digital Media Source . I ordered this product thinking on all the good reviews and thinking this was the " new version " of the product but instead it looks like I received the " very old " version . The package it came on was old . It didn't include foams in different sizes , just one replacement in the same size than the ones it had on . The only pro is that you can use this product as foam ear plugs to block outside noise .. but you can also get a pair for less than $ 1 in your closest pharmacy . Also , the bass is so booming that it gave me a big headache within a few minutes ( so buy a few aspirins too ! ) . Very bad response in the high frequency ( treble ) . I am going back to my old headphones .  
2	  Really decent sound clarity and affordable . They are a little snug across the head which may cause a little pressur owith extended wear but its only been a few hours so far . They wont slide off when you drop your pen that is for sure . Bendable mike with a really long cord that measures 105 inches , Yea crazy long but great for someone like me who rolls all over the office but is too cheap for a wireless set up .  
2	  This mouse lets you zoom in and out , program buttons for specific commands and actions . Works great on a Mac . This mouse is so good this is my second one . My previous one lasted 4 years with heavy design use .  
2	  The Logitech Z5500 5.1 speaker system , powered by my Xonar D2X 64 bit Surround Sound Card provides me with optically clear sound . There is absolutly no static whatever when I 'm using the optical side of the system . I use it with my home studio , and I am very pleased with it . Ronnie Bee  
1	  I looked forward to receiving my first large screen tv and was delighted that amazon carried such devices . I selected the Toshiba 51 inch projection systam based upon reccomendations recieved on the internet . As usual amazon sent numerous pre delivery emails which of course raised my expectations . There was even the possibility that the tv would arrive before the big " iron bowl " game which if you don't know is the biggest football game in the world and annually pits Auburn U. against their arch rival U. of Alabama . The truck driver called about a half hour out telling me of his imminent arrival . The select spot in the room was vacuumed again in anticipation . The truck arrived and the jovial driver and his helper were as excited as I was . I checked the box and there were no marks on it whatsoever . They carefully unpacked the tv and used the lift gate to softly lower it to the ground . They physically carried it up one flight of steps and set it ont the carpeted floor wher it was able to be moved via its own wheels into the place prepared for it . The drivers then cleaned up the carton and took it with them but the driver dialed his cell phone to contact the person who asked me various questions to which I reponded very positively and affirmatively . I also signed the form stating that I had received the tv in good shape . The driver had a truck full of refrigerator sized boxes and mentioned that he had eleven more deliveries to make that afternoon ! What a schedule ! After they left I took a nap to refresh myself ( I 'm 65 ) and then my son came home from college to finish the installation of the surround sound and connect the antenna and so on . After he had done the above he turned the set on and then my nitemare began . Because you see ther was no picture . It must be a mistake but I told my son to call Toshiba but they indignantly told him that this was a shipping problem and I had signed off on the shipping . I tried to call amazon but they don't have any phone number listed at ALL . Only an email which of course was out of order for some unknown length of time . Its still broke as of this writing . Eventually I got an email by pretinding something and got to speak to a human at amazon . Boy he was the snottiest individual I have encountered in a long long time and I dont reccomend that you ever speak to an individual at amazon . The reason he was snotty was because I had not powered up the tv before signing the document . He really couldn't believe it and when I countered that amazon had not warned me to do such he said o yes they had and with some difficulty ha bored down through about five livels where it says after delivery it is Toshiba 's responsibility but they had said ne but he said " too bad " its now your problem and when I subsequently called my sredit card company sthey said that amazon had been paid and the only way that they could do anything was for me to return the unit to wherever amazon was ( any ideas ) . How was I going to pack this monsterous tv with the carton gone and get it ou to ship it to somewhere ? So if anyone knows how to pack this monster blue light so that it can be shipped to somewhere or if someone knows how to get in touch with a thinking human at amazon or any way short of my only method to . Its probably illegal to say what I was going to . My email is raykellyray @ yahoo . com  
1	  Well , I 'd like to be able to review this kit but I can not use it ! There are no bulbs / lamps in the kit . Adorama is NOT helpful . It ' appears ' that the buld only costs $ 3.65 . However , neither Amazon nor Adorama 's websites show a ' fit ' . The floodlight states that only compatible bulbs should be used . More once I can use this product .  
1	  I bought my A75 to replace my aging Espon PhotoPC650 , which has served me well for the last four years . The camera 's pretty good , but .. Six weeks later , halfway through our family vacation , the A75 died with the e18 error . I changed the CF card in our hotel room , turned it on to check how many photos were available , turned the camera off . Ten minutes later at the restaurant , the camera wouldn't turn on . E18 on the display . Returned from vacation , sent it back . First warning sign - be suspicious of any company that doesn't have a Return Number Policy . When I called the factory service center to check on my status five days after they received it ( according to FedEx ) , it wasn't checked in . I asked to speak to a supervisor , was told she was busy and would call me back . Three hours later , no call back , so I tried again . Not only was my unit not checked in yet , I was told that they had 24 hours to call me back . Now that they 've finally checked it in , it 's going to be up to 14 business days before they send it back to me . As someone who used to run a warranty service center for a national company , I find Canon 's repair and return policies disturbing , and their turn-around time laughable . Returns should be checked in same day they are received , customers should have their calls returned the same day , and barring unusual circumstances , no repair should be in house for more than 10 days . This was my first , and now probably my last Canon product .  
1	  No battery included , and manual doesn't even tell you which battery it needs . Have spent way too much time trying to find a stupid battery . And the headphones are junky . DVD player is cute and works , but there are far better options available .  
1	  I bought this for my newborn 's room , used only a few times , lasted less than a month . Called Coby , customer service rep was very rude ! Called back to speak w / a manager , was on hold for over 15 minutes so I hung up ! Will never buy their products !  
1	  I got this adapter on September 9th 2011 . It worked fine for 8 months but unexpectedly broke . I didn't have any problems for those 8 months but I started hearing clicking noises on the power brick and it wouldn't charge anymore .  
2	  i have had the zune 30gb since it was released and it has never given me a reason not to enjoy it . it syncs and plays all of my music and videos instantly . even though its a bit of an older device the screen and picture quality are beautiful and smooth to look at . for me its a great value since i still use it everyday . if i do plan on upgrading to a new mp3 player it will be the zune hd since i have no huge complaints about the zune 30 . only con ( reason i gave it 4 stars ) : - the " brick " design to it , lol . when i wanna carry a smaller handbag it may take up most of the space because of its width .  
1	  I bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times . Last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed . I haven't changed anything or done anything . I have no idea what 's wrong with the camera , but given the price I 'm pretty annoyed and Amazon . com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days .  
2	  These headphones are the most comfortable ones out there .. for me . I have sensitive ears and the standard issue headphones just don't make the cut . But these sony 's are great for long term use . I haven't had a problem with the wires but i 'm not running marathons while wearing them . These headphones have great sound quality too . It 's like night and day . The music becomes an experience and not just background noise . Highly recommended .  
1	  I bought the camera three weeks ago and it was fine , i know have a problem with it , it comes on but will not do anything . it acts like a computer that has locked up , after 9 calls later someone finally called me back from vivitar and explained to me that they could fix it for $ 80 . ? . ? i asked about the warranty and they continued with the plastic case was under warranty .. Help  
2	  I love my Canon SD630 . Before going on a recent trip diving with family in the Caymans I was considering buying an underwater camera setup . They were big and bulky and not very versatile . Oh and expensive . I didnt want to fiddle with a new camera with new buttons and features at 100 ft depth on my dives . I 'm not good with learning curves .. I sprung for the case . It was awesomely fitted to fully use all features of the camera and the SD has an underwater setting that i discovered when using the manual ! We used the case it everyday of our vacation and managed to take absolutely awesome water featured pics . Whether it was splasing in the waves with my kids or diving to 120 ft it was safely encasing my camera and enabling me to just snap and shoot great great pics . Even my kids had fun taking water pics . It also made a sandy beach a worry free camera experience for a change and it works perfectly great as a surface camera while in the case even if you arent in the water . People who see the water pics assume i have some fancy underwater SLR or something . The case was easy to figure out , and as long as we remembered to fresh water rinse the sand off , and open up and dry out the seal at the end of the day , it was all ready for more the next day . I cannot more strongly recommend !  
1	  Bought the nextar Q3 gps for our vacation this summer . Took it out of the box charged the battery . Put it in the car hook up dc cord only to find out 3 hours later when the battery went dead the dc cord wasn't working . Called customer service they promised to send new cord in 7 to 10 days . Three times they promised to send a cord and on the fourth try they wanted me to buy one . I will never buy another nextar product nor should anyone else . The customer service is terrible they have no problem lying to their customers . I hope it not too late return it too the store  
2	  I got these headphones at the advice of my mother , they 've got great sound but can tend to leak a little if you pump the volume way up . They 've got that nifty cord protector which is a great feature that not many headphones have . The only else I can say is that while they are pretty comfortable .. if your head / ears are not exactly the right size they can get tiresome and sore to wear for long periods . Great buy for the money !  
1	  This is by far one of the worst DVD players I 've had the misfortune to own . Although it is a 5-disc player , it does not have continuous play - therefore one must press play to move on to the next CD . The player responds very slowly to each command - for example it takes approximately 30-45 secs after pressing the open / close button for the unit to open , or after pressing the menu button for you to be able to select a menu option . The only good thing I 'd say is that the sound - once the unit plays ( and it is temperamental , is quite good . Frankly , the only reason I haven't returned this player is because I can't find the receipt !  
2	  Worked grreat from the start . I did have it professionally installed because I just changed to cable internet . Would highly recommend this product .  
1	  I had to click a star to write this review . This seller and product rate 0 star . I am glad to see this item is no longer available on Amazon and I hope it stays that way . The MACTRAC Deluxe is a piece of junk . It comes with a FLOPPY DISC ! for installation . A FLOPPY DISC ! My MAC guy couldn't even get the thing to work . Amazon you need to be more careful and scrutinize your sellers and their products with more care .  
2	  the web cam is really worth the price with all its features . the best part is that the image quality is very good . i would recommend this webcam .  
1	  Product name is the same but outlook is totally different from the picture on the web . In addition , no " all region code " supportted ! I will return it ASAP .  
2	  This is a quality hdmi cord for the price . No problems to report and have been using for over a month . For under $ 2 you can't really complain .  
1	  I have only had this modem for a month . Now i have to unplug it and connot use the fax . It decided to start answering my phone without the receive fax option turned on . When plugged in i can't use my phone .  
2	  The speakers are great , I have a Ipod nano and the base doesn't match with it , but I made a cut at the base and works fine . The sound is well , doesn't explote the house but make some noise :)  
2	  The standard monitor risers were just what we needed . We used them for 2 pc monitors and 1 tv .  
1	  I wouldn't waste your money on buying this .. mine broke after two weeks in a dry room tempature place . Meaning , it wasn't because I got water in it because its a " shower " radio .. I never tested that out but if I did it would of probably broke even sooner . I 'm very disappointed :(  
2	  No problems with it in years , works like a charm . Very comfortable . Couldn't be happier with this product . If you want an ergo keyboard this is your choice .  
2	  Great product and it took only 2 days to receive from regular schedule . Impressive !  
2	  I am really liking this camera . Great pictures . very easy to use menu system . Feels great in my hands ( this is subjective ) .. It has a quality feel to it . Great battery life . I also like the fact you can add filters to this and there are available lenses you can add ( though this is not a true DSLR ) . Overall I find this a 5 star camera as I can not think of anything wrong with it . Some reviews mention the noise .. but I do not find this to be that bad plus it is not showing up too bad on small prints .. and I do not do much shooting at high ISO 's anyway . I get great shots indoors with low ISO . I really like this camera ..  
1	  I bought this router about 8 months ago ( in May 2008 ) . The one I have is a rev . C ( still the current model ) . Since I got it , I 'd occasionally had problems with my Internet connection not working for a few minutes to up to an hour ; I thought it was Comcast 's problem based on some simple network diagnostics . However , I realized at some point that the desktop computer that I rarely use , and which is plugged into the wired network port , was still connected just fine even when my laptop was unable to connect to the Internet ( although the laptop could connect to the router just fine , e.g. , to change the router 's configuration ) . So there 's something wrong with this router . I tried upgrading the firmware , and changing a whole bunch of configuration options , but nothing helped .  
2	  The modulator works , as my cheap MP3 player does in fact play through the radio . The weird thing I 've seen is that I have to crank the volume on both the MP3 player and the radio in order to hear the audio . There doesn't seem to be a lot of noise resulting from that though . I don't know if that is a problem with my MP3 player not putting out enough signal or a problem with the modulator . Also , I noticed that I experienced a similar loss in volume for my AM stations after I installed this product . I 'm a little confused by that considering this doesn't have anything to do with AM . Overall , it works , but the gotchas are worth mentioning . Update : I 've worked through a couple of issues I had with this device . It turns out that the lack of volume had more to do with the lousy MP3 player I had at the time not putting out any signal than it did with the modulator . I now have a Sandisk Sansa e250 , and I don't have to turn it up nearly so much . Also , if you listen to AM radio make sure you keep the switch that this unit comes with somewhere you can reach it . If you turn the unit off , AM will come in better . That 's kind of a pain , and that 's the only reason I didn't update to 5 stars .  
1	  The Griffin TuneJuice 2 Battery Backup for iPod is deemed by most reviewers as pretty lame as a battery extender and charger . But there is an alternative , and it is quite good in terms of performance and value . It is called Music Power 0900-72 Encore Dual Port USB AC Charger with Rechargeable Extended Battery . It is not a one-piece design like the Kensington Mini Battery Extender and Charger , but because of that , it is more flexible ( It 's a general purpose portable / AC 2-port USB charger ) and will allow me to continue my Skype session without interruption . In other words , I can CHARGE my iPod Touch and USE my headphone / microphone at the same time . Not only that , there is no issue with having to remove iPod Touch 's protective case if you have one , or having to maintain a certain angled contact between the battery and the iPod for positive charging to take place . For me , this is a much better and more practical solution to extending the use of my iPod Touch . And it is also cheaper than the Kensington , plus you will most likely be able to use this battery on future versions of iPod and things that rely on USB power . I highly recommend it ( Music Power 0900-72 Encore ) .  
2	  Before buying the IPAQ hx2795 , check out the HP IPAQ 210 . It 's about the same price . Starting today , the HP IPAQ 210 is available directly from HP ! I bought one with the 4 inch screen . I can't wait to test drive this baby !  
1	  I am on the same boat with people who rated low . This mouse died after about 6 months . If you are rich , keep buying this one and keep replacing . I am not , so I will buy another product as a replacement .  
1	  Don't buy this if you intend to use it with an iTouch . It doesn't fit , and certainly not with any sort of case on it .  
2	  I 'm not kidding . I just plugged it in , setup the DSL settings using the auto function , setup encryption , and that was it . It found my laptop and desktop pc . I 'm using XP and 2000 . I setup the pc printer to share . I live in a 2-bedroom apartment and I can get 90 % signal anywhere in it . Highly recommended .  
2	  Works out really well , the construction is pretty neat how it folds out . i dont even know how it turns on and off , it think when ever its open its on , and whenever its closed it turns off . Works as decribed , although im having some trouble with the Drive on My TXthe function keys wont navigate to applications in full screen for some reason . Still , works well as a keyboard .  
1	  This volume control dramatically reduced to amount of bass that goes through it . I tried it with multiple systems and each one of them sounded better without the volume control .  
1	  I had purchased an earlier 64MB Rio , and loved it . So when I wanted more memory , I naturally tried another Rio . As soon as got my new Rio home , it didn't work . I exchanged it for another , and that one worked for three months , and then the volume button stopped working . If it weren't for these problems , I 'd rate it five stars . The controls are intuitive , and you can figure out everything without reading the manual . The only thin it lacks is the " pants clip " that the earlier Rio 64MB had - that is a lot more comfortable than the belt / arm device the new one has .  
1	  Although the price of the cable was excellent $ 1.58 . The old saying you get what you pay for came through on this one . The USB end was slightly crooked and could not fit into any USB port . At $ 1.58 it would cost me more to return it than just throw it out . Sad and still looking for the correct cable .  
1	  I looked forward to using these headphones as an improvement over the buds you get with the ipod nano . But when I wear them the way that is dipicted on the photo in the carton they fit so snugly on my ears that they muffle the sound . When I turn them upside down they fit loosely enough for a beautiful pristene sound but they feel uncomfotable to the point where I 'm constantly thinking about them or trying to adjust them . Maybe the reason they fit so tightly on my ears muffling the sound is because I have a big head , I don't know . From the reviews I thought this was a sure purchase , but it wasn't . Oh well , another $ 50 down the drain . I 'll have to go back to the buds . Sorry .  
2	  I purchased a 30gb iPod Vid . some time ago . To start off , I have to say it 's great looking . The sound quality is amazing - I hook it up to my home theater system and it produces amazing sound quality and bass . The click wheel is super easy and is convenient for extended use - everything is right there . The quality of the graphics is very impressive - super bright and clear . With Videora iPod converter ( free ) , you can download or rip DVD 's and place ANY video file from ANY source by transcoding it . Now the Cons : This product is delicate . It is in no way " extreme " or " sporty " . Imagine you are buying a gem . This in fact is so delicate , that I would say that you might as well burn your $ 300.00 than buy one WITHOUT FIRST buying a cover or case . DO NOT USE THIS without buying a case please . I tell you this from experience . The 1st iPod video I bought was so scratched by the 3rd day , that you could no longer view your videos in acceptable quality . I ended up exchanging it some how ( hard thing to do ) , and getting a new one . BUT I didnt dare to use it until I bought a case by the brand " zcover " ( In my opinion , the best case out there - very usefull and protective ) . Basically , it 's being fragile is the only problem I found to it . Another thing is that I would go with the white iPod , which seems to show finger prints and scratches much less than the black . Overall , it really is worth it . IF you buy a cover with it . I use it at the gym , when I go out to run , in the car - everywhere . Its really light and given the fact that it has 30GB , i 'd say it pretty small . In my opinion , there is no other MP3 out in the market right now that matches the iPod video .  
2	  I have a lot of burnable CDs that I use for both work and driving in the car - these , combined with the silver paint sharpies , make it easy to burn a CD and jot down whatever 's on it . The black CDs almost require the silver paint sharpies , but any other CD works just fine with the standard black sharpie colors . I 've never had a dead CD with these and the coloration also makes the " see-through " CD a thing of the past . Worth the extra for the upgrade .  
1	  This scanner has started giving me the " Scanner Failure " problem about 6 months after owning it . Because I use this for my business , I honestly thought that I was just trying to fax too many pages in one fax . So after all of the lights started to blink and the things freaked out on me , I would unplug it and restart it . Then it would grind for about 3 minutes , say " Scanner Failure " and tell me to restart . Sometimes I even had to leave it off for about 3 hours in order for it to reset itself . Finally , after I had enough , I called tech support only for them to give me the option to upgrade for $ 130.00 . No thanks ! So , after years and years of being a total HP fan , I gave up . DO NOT BUY A HP ALL-IN-ONE PRODUCT ! THEY SUCK ! I will never buy another HP all-in-one ever again . Tech support sucks just as bad as their equipment . I replaced it with a Dell All-in-One and paid $ 175 for it . I have not had any trouble with the Dell at all and it scans and faxes 60 page packages everyday without a hitch ! Now that 's what I call a deal !  
2	  This combination wireless keyboard & mouse is just what I was looking for .. a simple one that is the size of a regular keyboard , and doesn't have all the extra ( and un-needed ) buttons of the fancier models . I have always liked the look , feel and quality of Logitech keyboards and mice ; and this bundle is no exception . Nice clean look , good feel & touch and smooth reliable mouse operation .  
1	  I bought this scanner from Amazon , and while the price was great , the money that I spent on it was completely wasted , since this scanner is not compatible with my computer ! I have a COMPAQ PRESARIO 7360 , which does not use a Pentium chip , and so my computer does not recognize this scanner . So beware - this scanner is not compatible with all computer , something that Microtek does NOT make the buyer aware of !  
2	  I bought the Visor after my Philips Nino DIED after less than two months of service . The short battery life of the Nino wasn't nice , but the short life of the BACKUP battery definitely hurt ! I didn't bother getting it changed , the Nino is in the bin . So , I had the obvious choice of the Palm platform . It is robust , no crashes ( yes , CE crashes big time ) , highly compatible ( CE has compatibility problem with Win NT ! ) and has extremely long battery life ( 2 months , versus 2 days for CE powered devices ) . The obvious choice was Palm IIe for a no-frill technology minded engineer like me . However , Handspring popped up on my screen at the right time . Now this is what I call value . Handspring was established by the inventor of the original Palm Pilot and the team consists of all the key personnel of Palm Computing ( before they left ! ) . The Visor , from all that I have read , was developed to OVERTAKE Palm , in terms of productivity , infinitely upgradeability and value . The Visor is selling at around the same price as the Palm IIe and has about the same specifications . However , while the Palm IIe will always be what it is , the Visor can be upgraded through the purchase of SpringBoard modules . These modules include memory , backup software , games ( like PGA Golf ) , digital camera ( you read RIGHT ! ) etc etc , and a lot are on the pipeline . And remember , anything that runs on Palm will run on the Visor , they use the same operating system . Also , Visor comes with the IMPROVED version of Datebook , called Datebook + , and it 's more useful than ever . It is so user friendly it requires NO learning on my part and I could almost run it straight out of the box . Now you know why the Visor is a better choice than Palm II , and even Palm V. Identify your need . If you see less than 1200 friends normally , I guess you would be very happy with the normal Visor ( also , really great for college students , believe me ) . If you are the gadget guy , go get the Deluxe version ( with more RAM and comes in five tasty colors ) . Still want to get the Palm ? Well , feel free .. I stick with my Visor , with a big smile knowing that it is 110 % well worth the money .  
2	  I cannot say enough good about this unit I have had it in 4 different units . ' pickup , car , motorcycle , quad . On each unit it worked with not one problm . I would put an address in and it would put me with in 10 feet of my dest . If you went off corse it would reroute you right now . The only thing that I could see wrong with it is the speed did not match what I was in , but that could be the vehicle I was in . Over all I am very pleased with the 550 . papajoe  
2	  These headphones were the best option , for what I wanted . Good sound quality , wireless , AND ( of coarse ) great price > compared to others . We need to produce ' better ' , more socially / environmentally conscious products , but that is something that we will have to work on . In the mean time , let 's shop as smart as possible .. Thank you for your time .  
1	  I do not recommend this toner cartridge . I 've printed less than 200 pages and the ink is starting to fade . I have to take out the cartridge and shake it for every 5-6 pages I print .  
2	  I bought these when they cost more than they do now . Back then , they were still worth every penny . They are far above any competitor in the price range , and work as well as Bose but at a fraction the cost . My wife and I both now own a pair ; the case is great too , holding the cords , extra batteries , and has enough space for an iPod Touch to fit in , too ! I never fly without them anymore ! A side note , I use them at home sometimes , and without power applied they still work ( unlike Bose ) . However , they sound better with power than unpowered .  
1	  This worked fine in windows XP , as long as you didn't try to register more than one login or more than one finger . After that it would go out of control and not let you login except randomly with the first finger registered . No drivers for win7-don't waste your time .  
2	  I was blown away when I got this case . It was huge and it looks awesome . Very nice case with plenty of room and very sturdy .  
1	  you get what you pay for . Need to spend money to get quality optics . You can really tell in low light and clarity .  
2	  This charger was in very excellent condition like new , genuine my laptop works great again excellent price for this excellent item .  
1	  Seems like the nicest shower radio out there , and has a lot of nice features , but is not very water proof . First one quit working , and when I opened the battery compartment , it was completely rusted . It was hung on a towel rack at the far end of the shower , and didn't have a whole lot of direct water sprayed at it . I tried to clean it out , but I think too much water had gotten in and fried the unit . We ended up throwing it out . We liked the radio so much we thought we 'd give it another chance and purchased another one . The second one started to have the same problem . I cleaned up the battery compartment and let if air out for a few days and it started working again . We now only use it on the bathroom counter . I still think it 's a nice radio , but not really worth it if it can't be used in the shower . I think if the battery compartment cover had a better rubber gasket , and was able to be tightened down , then it would be perfect .  
2	  I have never been a person who can wear standard earbuds , like for the iPod . I 've tried the kind that are supposed to hook around your ears as well , but no luck there either . I purchased these two years ago and have found them very comfortable , and they sound fantastic , especially for working out . They are starting to lose their sound quality now , but I 've beaten these things to death , and would absolutely buy them again . Don't hesitate !  
1	  Received Firelite portable as a gift and while it worked on my Mac G5 desktop it didn't work on either a Toshiba notebook or Apple Powerbook . This has to be more then a coincedence since a similar drive by CMS works perfectly on all three machines without the need for an adaptor . The support offered by the Smartdisk site did not resolve the problem .  
2	  Disclosure : I 've worked at Microsoft for about a year now , although I am in no way related to the Zune team , nor do I have any info a consumer doesn't have . I 've had mine since this Tuesday and am comfortable with my understanding of it at this point . So , what are my thoughts ? First off , Zune is an _ excellent _ music player . The experience for music use is nearly perfect . On this front it has one killer feature compared to the iTunes / iPod combo which is Zune Pass . Zune Pass is a $ 15 a month subscription where you can download and put on your Zune nearly any song from the Zune Marketplace ( in my experience I have been able to download every song I wanted except for Beatles songs , but those aren't available via iTunes either ) . The second is the Zune-to-Zune sharing feature , which is really only appealing in high Zune-density areas ( like the Microsoft campus ) until Zune becomes more widespread . There is also a 3 day or 3 plays limitation to shared music , but this doesn't affect anyone with Zune Pass since they can simply download the song when they get back to their computer ( shared music is flagged for you when you sync so you can download it [ zune pass ] or buy it [ no pass ] if you decide you like it and want to keep it . Audio quality is excellent and even the included ear bud headphones are a step above those included with other players . The video experience has pluses and minuses . The pluses are that the screen is large , clear and bright . It makes watching video on the postage-stamp style screens on the video iPods seem ridiculous . Seriously , was it that important to them to have it look exactly the same as the day it came out that they didn't bother reorienting the screen for maximum real estate ? Maybe they could but had battery problems I don't know . Or maybe they thought the boring iPod shape was " iconic " and didn't want to change it . Needless to say I 'm sure a future version of the iPod will correct this problem , but as of now the experience of watching video goes to Zune hands down . That brings us to the problem which is lack of content . Zune cannot play protected mp4 files so you can't watch the video available from the iTunes store and Zune as of now has no videos in the marketplace . Your only options are any unprotected mp4 or wmv video you might have or can find on YouTube , Soapbox or Google video . While it is technically possible to rip your DVDs to Zune format , due to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act it is currently illegal to do so if your DVD is encrypted ( nearly all commercial DVDs are encrypted and while copying your DVD onto your portable device is legal , the Digital Millennium Copyright act made it illegal to break encryption on media without the permission of the copyright holders ) . Enterprising users will discover that they can decrypt their DVDs using freely available ( though illegal in the US ) software and then encode them to Zune format using Windows Media Encoder ( available from Microsoft ) , but there is no US based commercial software available to streamline and make the process easy . The few companies under US jurisdiction that produced such software were sued out of existence by the movie studios . On the plus side , if you have a Media Center computer , you can convert your recorded TV shows to play on Zune , but not many people have a Media Center at this point . As such , the best option would be if the Zune Marketplace had a video catalog similar to the iTunes store , but as of release , there are no videos in the Marketplace . I 'm sure that this is simply a side effect of the fact that the Zune team didn't have the resources to sign up the TV studios and the music studios at the same time and will be remedied in the near future . In fact , nearly everything about the Zune seems to be geared towards future improvement . The upgradeable firmware of the device along with it 's hardware capabilities pave the road for a number of as of yet unimplemented features which will no doubt be implemented not too far down the road such as wireless sync'ing , wireless purchasing and downloading of music directly on the device , games , videos in the Zune marketplace and more Zune-to-Zune features along the lines of song sharing . If I had to summarize my feelings about Zune in a few sentences , I would say that what Zune does it does very well . That seems to be the design choice made . Rather than throwing in every feature under the sun with lackluster execution , the designers clearly decided to do what they could do well and with polish and leave those other features for future updates . As of launch that means that you have an excellent music player and a store to go along with it , and also an excellent video player , but no videos to watch on it . If you can live without a video / TV store for your player , or feel comfortable transferring recorded media from your Media Center PC or have another video source , I can highly recommend this player for you .  
1	  I had the Canon S70 for about 3 years and one day the image sensor broke . The cost to repair it was about $ 150 or half of the price of the camera when new . I then went with the PowerShot SD550 and after 3 months , the clip that holds the battery compartment shut broke off . Luckily it is still under warranty . Both Canons took great pictures , I took good care of them but they are prone to breaking .  
1	  Batteries do not retain their charge for any length of time , even if they are not being used . I charged the batteries for use in my golf GPS . Put them in the GPS a 3 days before I played . The device was not turned on . I had low batteries indicator as soon as I turned the device on , put in the spare batteries which were supposedly fully charged and had the same problem . I get 4 rounds of gold out of regular batteries and have yet to get a single round out of the rechargeable batteries .  
1	  this splitter is terrible . my roommate and i both run vga cables from our laptops to the tv and thought a splitter would make it so much easier than having to switch the cables back and forth , WRONG . the splitter dumbed down the resolution of the image going through to the screen and gave one of the worst images ive ever seen . just dont even bother with this piece of junk .  
1	  Completely unreliable & unstable . Bought this to use as a backup drive to save family photos , videos , etc . Drive decides when and if it wants to turn on , when / if it gets recognized by my comp , etc . Have tried this thing with multiple PCs with the same poor results . Remarkably undependable product .  
1	  This product was " dead on arrival " . It would not transmit . It would charge the iPod , but that is all . I returned it and got a different product .  
2	  I was scared to buy the Palm m505 because I read all the reviews on how the color screen was too dim , there was no contrast , and people had to consistently use the backlight . But I found that the unit 's color deficiency is not really that important . Compared to the V unit that I owned previously to this one , I found that both the units display about the same intensity of light ( although Palm V had contrast included ) . Under normal lighting conditions ( i.e. in my office ) , I can see perfectly fine on my unit and the color is discernable . I found that people who are really into getting bright colors should check out something like the new but bulkier Sony Clie products . As for me , the Palm 's sleekness , its size and functionality are unbeaten especially for the V , Vx , m500 and m505 series of Palms . The only complaint that I can really offer and the reason I can't give this product 5 stars is the same as I 've seen from other users in that Palm really messed up in not making its m500 series backward compatible in terms of cases and accessories . What irritated me more than the color screen was the fact that I can't use any of my old Palm V accessories with this Palm . I have to purchase a new case and keyboard specifically designed for the m500 series ( when I know that most users assumed the m500 series was an extension of the V , Vx series of Palms ) . Because this is the first time Palm has done anything to upset me with their product , I decided to stay becuase the organizer is such a good product . But if Palm decided to do this gimmick again on their next series of Palms , I would seriously consider switching over to another PDA or Pocket PC device .  
2	  I bought this unit for work . We have an HP 4600 color laser printer that had some unacceptable color streaking in its ' output . I ran multiple field service diagnostics and controller resets to no avail . It was concluded that the power supply or the DC controller board in the printer were probably bad . To prevent the spotty power in the building housing the printer from causing this issue to recur if we paid for an expensive service call , I ordered this unit . I hooked the APC voltage regulator up to the printer in preparation for the service call and thought to run one more test on the printer . The voltage regulator apparently cleaned up the power issues enough that the output came out crisp and unstreaked . Fairly amazing . That was a month ago and we still have not needed to contact a service tech for the printer as the output has been decent ever since we put this unit between the printer and the building power outlet . Definitely worthwhile if you have dirty power lines .  
1	  It 's not what it is described ! It was very hard to stick the protector to the screen . It 's not really anti-glare . With the protector , the Image & text on the screen are not sharp . I try to return this item to BoxWave , but found that " Any ClearTouch products with its plastic backing sheets removed or re-attached at any time are not returnable " ( [ .. ] ) Don't waste money on this product ! ps : this is the first time I try to return a product bought from Amazon .  
1	  We purchased the first PDR-M25 on 5/16 . It lasted for 31 days , and then it would not turn on . Toshiba exchanged it for another camera ( same model ) . When the replacement came , it would NOT take a picture when it first came out of the box . Then it took a few pictures , and then seized up again and the shutter button would not work . Toshiba sent another camera , same model , and it lasted 61 days before it refused to focus properly and the flash got out of sync with the shutter . I am awaiting camera # 4 , as Toshiba refused to send my money back .  
1	  MarginMart sent a black generic cable - not the Belkin item they pictured - I think they just expect people to roll over because of the price . You can find the real thing for a buck and a half more elsewhere .  
2	  I purchased this bag , while deployed to Baghdad . It arrived very quickly and was the perfect size for my personal laptop . Construction and quality are great !  
1	  I bought this printer for commercial purposes and now it sits unused . The printer does not print heavyweight stock ( notecard ) or multiples well . Inks are too expensive to make a commerical project pay . If you want to buy substitute inks that are cheaper than Epson 's stay away from all but especially those from X-print and the online dealer Clickinks . No support from them at all and the cartridges print fewer pages than Epson 's . Epson has since come out with the R1800 , but the experience with this one has put me on hold for further Epson printers . Buy a cable ( USB ) when you buy this printer if you do , because a cable doesn't come with it .  
2	  I added this remote control to my DSLR arsenal approximately a year ago and I am very much impressed with this remote control . I have used this remote for taking pictures for potraits , objects , family group photos , with the camera on a tripod . Its very handy and very useful if you don't want to use the in built timer in the camera and run to get into the picture shot . 4 stars .. ? because a couple of times there were issues with the range of this remote control . But overall satisfied with this tiny / useful accessory .  
1	  Wow , I ordered two things from this seller and this was the last thing scheduled to show up . It was the first thing to show up and 3 days early ! Talk about awesome . Not a thing wrong with it either . Works perfect .  
1	  I bought this item in February after seeing the good reviews and cheap price . It worked fine for about 6 months . Had some issue where I had to reconnect to my network after around 6 months . Then just a few days ago it just died . I see from the one star reviews that this isn't an isolated case and it looks like calling the company will require a couple hours of tech support . It 's not worth the hassle for $ 25 . I guess I am one of the unlucky ones . I will cut my losses , but will not buy D-Link again .  
1	  Another case of a purchase to accompany the Kodak V-550 camera , as recommended by Amazon . This charger is not compatible with the KLIC-7001 Li-ion battery used in the referenced camera . The product needed is the K 7500C charger . I was not able to find the K 7500C on Amazon , but did manage to obtain from the Kodak website . I gave a 1-star rating because Amazon 's return system only provides one option for returning the " wrong product " , and fault for the error defaults to the consumer , who ultimately absorbs the return shipping charges . An accurate product description at the point of sale , including a list of compatible batteries would have been nice .  
1	  Media code is MCC 01RG20 , which is Mitsubish Chemicals Corporation . They have an excellent reputation , which is why I was so surprised that this media is as bad as it is . I 'm using a Plextor PX-708A with the 1.08 firmware revision . The first 4X burn produced a coaster with tons of bad sectors , and visible dye damage . The second at 4X also had visible dye damage , but my recorder was able to read each sector . My Sony DVD player ( older and picky ) couldn't read it . A 2X burn produced something my DVD player could handle ( at least the title screen comes up , and the titles start playing - haven't checked playability across the entire disc ) . There 's still visible dye damage , so I 'm skeptical . Having bought this media so I could burn at 4X to produce something my DVD player will like ( have to burn at 2.4X with my + R media to achieve that ) , I 'm quite disappointed with the results .  
1	  Bought these for my husband who is a lifeguard and after using them for a month the rubber was cracking , eye rubber piece that was held by glue came off which caused the seal to not work and thus they fogged up , and one of the lenses also came loose . contacted barska and they said they would replace them or send new ones but we had to pay a $ 25 repair and shipping fee and also were responsible to pay the shipping to ship them to them . After 30 days of owning them I didn't not think it was right to have to pay to get defective binoculars repaired . Also if they fell apart after a short time what is to be expected later .  
2	  I simply cannot believe how cheap these suckers are . I would easily throw down another 20 for another pair of these . I 've had them since September , and I 've yet to experience any problem with them . Volume is a little low , but I don't blast it anyways so its cool by me .  
1	  Seems nice when you first get it . Clip on back is sturdy , buttons still easy to operate . My experience was that the clip was heavy , and tore away from the body of the case . Didn't last one day of bike riding . Like the player , hate the case .  
2	  Excellent 4-pack of tapes . Been buying Maxwell for years now and never have had any problem 's or been unhappy at all !  
2	  Nice unit with one significant drawback . There 's a light at the end of the microphone that flashes when the phone is in use ( presumably to alert those around you that you are occupied ) . Kind of annoying in itself but the real problem is that there is a faint beep that accompanies each flash . Some people get used to it I hear . Bugs me though . Otherwise the unit works wonderfully .  
2	  Case Logic DCB-56 High Zoom Digital Camera Case ( Red ) I purchased this for my wife 's new small digital camera and it is perfect for what she needed . Just the right size and having two external zipped compartments where you can safely store camera memory cards .  
2	  What an outstanding product ! For simplicity and convenience of design it is truly outstanding . It is an inexpensive model yet its construction was remarkably sturdy ; good acoustics . I appreciated the large on-am-fm switch in front and the easy-to read dial ; many were the nights I availed myself of this little unit , reaching over groggily in the dark to flip it on in the dark for news , music , sports or talk thereby easing the occasional sleepless night . I regret that it is no longer in production ; wish Panasonic would bring it back to market ..  
2	  I went with a corded mouse because I didn't want to have to fool with changing batteries all the time . Also , I 'd heard that cordless mice can sometimes not be as precise or dependable as corded mice . This mouse is smooth and precise , and the contoured shape fits my hand perfectly . The wheel works well , but is a bit noisy . I 've gotten used to it though , and really have no significant complaints . It 's a great , dependable mouse .  
1	  This humidifier is loud , the white noise could be soothing to some , but annoying for other people . The reason I am rating this with a 2 because it leaked a HUGE puddle of water the second night I used it . I returned this humidifier and went with theFuijitronic FB-602 Ultrasonic Humidifier with Built-in Ionizer and haven't had a single problem . Our toddler also loves the little bear design .  
1	  I purchased this product after tons of research . In concept the product seemed to be just what I wanted . Nice looking , bluetooth phone capability , works on a battery , has excellent sound and many great features and was reasonably priced . In reality the product is very flawed . Here are some of the problems that I found with the unit after only two days of use .. 1 . You CAN NOT SEE the unit in direct sunlight , period . Outdoors in the shade is not much better . This is totally not acceptable to me . 2 . The maps are not very accurate . It says you have reached your destination a 1/2 block before you actually do and once when the expressway split , it never said to stay right or left ! 3 . I was driving down the street toward a destination and it continuously said to make a " U-Turn " for no reason at all . This happened several times4 . It tells you when to turn at 500 yards , 300 yards , 100 yards and then when you are right at the intersection it says turn now .. as you are virtually in the intersection . 5 . POI 's are very weak . It says it has millions , but the main categories did not include any stores , banks , ATM 's or many other useful categories . 6 . It had problems finding a satellite several times and took up to 5 minutes find a signal , in suburban Chicago . 7 . The included manual is about 10 pages and is designed to be a " quick start " guide . It does includes a manual on the cd but when I tried to load it , the CD did not work on my PC ( confirmed by customer support that the CD does not work ) 8 . The keyboard is way too small when entering addresses , ( and I don't have a large hand ) . A few good points : 1 . They have excellent technical support . I called and spoke to a very pleasant customer service rep who then handed me over the the Customer Service Manager who conferenced in the Product Manager who addressed my problems . However , they did not admit that the screen totally washes out but rather said " all touch screens will wash out in the sunlight , ours just happens to be the best of the lot " . I challenged them by telling them that their web site states in the features section that the unit has an " Anti-glare screen : Always an optimal view , even in direct sunlight " and that was not an accurate statement . They were pleasant but could not fix design problems over the phone . 2 . Very good sound quality , if you don't mind not seeing the screen , you might like this unit for that reason . 3 . Very attractive unit . 4 . Great windshield mountThe Final Decision on keeping the unit was made for my by TomTom as the the unit broke on my third day and would not power up so I returned it to Best Buy and my problems with this unit are over . Bottom line , the product sounds great on their web site and with a different screen , better maps , and the bugs worked out it would be great . My advise , make sure you can return it without a restocking fee because the product is really disappointing .  
1	  After receiving the cable I installed it on my digital menu player and it did not work . After 2 hours of trouble shooting our media player we looked at the cables and found the cable we just purchased had a pin pushed in 3/4 of the way and would not work .  
1	  Does not operate well in OS-X . Drive is not accessable in OS-X unless Classic OS-9 is running on bootup . This means that you cannot run OS-X applications directly from the drive . The transfer rate for this drive is extremely slow when uploading digital video files directly from the camera to the drive . The drive will lockup and you will need to reboot the system to unlock the drive if you cannot unlock it by powering the drive on and off . Maxtor customer service is lacking , as well . There is no disclaimer on the box or any of their documentation on their website advising consumers about compatability problems with OS-X . They do not have any driver updates section for this drive on their website . I finally found the OS-X disclaimer after I downloaded the Software Installation file and decompressed it . This file should have been on the webpage as a notice . Maxtor makes very good products , but they really stepped on it with this one . They need to do a better job with Mac products if they want to keep their share of this market , or just do us a favor and stop producing for the Mac and save us a lot of time .  
2	  I have owned this product for about two weeks or so . The first few times I was out in traffic , I really thought it was broken because it very rarely did anything ! . I called whistler about it because I thought it was broken . The very infomative support person I talked to said It sounds like it is working ok . and that I would be suprised how many patrol cars do not use there radar . so I should try it for awhile first then If I am not happy send it to them . Well this AM I got into my car and turned it on in my driveway . it started going off ! I turned down the road the beeping went to a higher and higher # on the scale . about a mile down the road was a patrol car sitting in a school zone it then regged a 9 on the scale . So I am so pleased to say I love this product It does not seem to give alot of false alerts like other products on the market .  
1	  Stay away from this piece of crap ! I bought this item because , after rebates , it would havebeen the least expensive of its kind . I say WOULD HAVEBEEN , but the manufacturer lost the UPC code that I sentit , and denied my rebate . They said they would accept acopy of it , but still I wait . Meanwhile , this item has one of two possible chipsets init . The guy at the store said it had the Intersil Prismchip , for which my driver works well . No , it actually hadthe Ralink RT2570 . So I installed the driver from Ralink , and what a disaster . My linux box has never been so unstable . The internet link through this D-Link adapter would crashoften ( about every 10 minutes ) , and not restart unless Ireloaded the driver . And that would crash the whole system30 percent of the time . I replaced this item with a Netgear WG111 v2 , and it worksso much better . I have to use the WinXP driver , and it hassome stability problems , but stays connected for days . While my past experiences are not necessarily an indicationof your future experience , why take the chance ?  
1	  Keys started failing after about 2 months , and some of the key markings rubbed off too . Not recommended .  
1	  I would not recommend buying this printer . Mine is only 4000 copies old , has already gone through 3 toner cartridges , and emits a high-pitched earsplitting squeal when printing . Since it was still under warranty , I got Sharp to exchange it . Sharp customer service is fast and pleasant , but the problem remains unsolved . The replacement ( refurbished ) machine is even louder . I can't pinpoint the origin of the noise , except to say it is not the scanner unit . My guess is either the paper exit roller or the drum . The drum is not guaranteed , but should certainly last longer than 4000 copies . It also eats large quantities of toner while producing copies that are way too light . It is also considerably slower than the 12 sheets a minute it is rated .  
1	  Cute phone ! BUT , backward engineered . NO SHARED PHONE BOOK , Yes , 4 phones and you have to enter all your contacts separately . Plus , you have to keep track of new inputs so that you can enter them into the other 3 phones . I have had 2 previous Vtech models and they had shared phonebooks . I give this phone a - 10 for engineering friendly .  
2	  I got my wallet the day I got back from a long trip .. and planed to return it .. for a refund , but then I looked at it . This wallet is perfect for the m505 and has allowed me to reduce the amount of stuff that I put into my pockets every day . The Palm slides onto the rail for a secure fit . The other flap in the wallet holds my drivers license , credit cards , cash and cards for the m505 all very nicely . The walet also fits nicely into the pocket of all my shorts and pants . It feels well crafted and the leather is very nice . Overall , I am glad I bout it ..  
1	  My old Hp Pavilion ( now my mother uses it ) is a 2001 with a PII 600 cpu . A Generic 128Mb SDRAM PC133 ram went bad . This machine originally did not have a Generic PC133 in it , but was added later and worked many years . The computer worked fine until the Generic ram went bad ( The original 128Mb ram is still working , but too small ) . I thought all SDRAM are the same and backwards compatible . Unfortunately I was wrong and bought this ram ; my BIOS seen the size fine and I tried different configurations , but no go the computer would not boot . I wrote to the seller Cybermedia about my computer not accepting this ram . Their response was that there is such a thing as HIGH DENSITY and LOW DENSITY ram . They offered to check it out and if they found a problem they would replace it . The shipping back and forth costs more than the ram is worth , so I am out 10.00 for nothing . This review is not against Cybermedia , only beware some ram is not compatible . This ram happens to be High Density . Also the ram pictured shows the chips vertically the one I received were horizontal - I am not sure this makes a any difference .  
1	  I bought a Philips Shoqbox and the small device crashes once in a while . After upgrading the firmware , the MusicMatch software doesn't connect well with the Shoqbox so I had to manually copy all the MP3s from the device back to the laptop , format the Shoqbox , troubleshooting and finally found a way to put the music back on . That wasn't a long time ago .. I decided to get a digital picture frame as a birthday present for my wife . Wanted to get something that looks nice and works well . One thing I noticed while researching , was people were distrubed by the fact that some frames don't resize the pic to fit the screen , so this is one of the factor while I was looking . Then I found this Philips frame , and users claimed it does the job well . Boy , was I wrong . Pros : 1 . Good looking2 . Screen looks nice . I won't say 6.5-inch screen is a pro because I paid for it . Cons : 1 . Software . Oh my god . The Philips ' software team really screw people big time . The software implemented on the frame is hard to work with , and you have to press so many buttons to get some simple tasks done . The desktop software is useless .. glad I can copy picutre to the frame without using it . Otherwise it would take you years to get the picture to the picture frame before you can use it . In short , the software design is not logical at all . When you think Microsoft 's software is bad , you 've got to check this one out . 2 . What others talk about " resizing " to fit the screen is really " reducing " the picture size according to the ratio . So if you have a square picture that you want to upload to the frame , it will display it square , and the details are being squeezed just to fit the height of the screen . So my square-picture example is kind of a bad one .. but the frame is expecting picture of 3x4 and not 4x6 . Some of my pictures are in 4x6 , so the pitures would have black bars on both sides . 3 . The power adapter is HUGE . 4 . It seems to have a built-in battery , but I think it doesn't last more than 30 minutes .. I don't recall the spec saying how long the battery last , maybe I have to read the manual again , but then there 's NONE ! I couldn't find this information in the box ! Wouldn't it be nice for me to charge it and it lasts for like 8-10 hours ? ! I 've had enough with everything from Philips that require software or firmware update . So skip this one and save yourself from trouble . = This section has been added as I 've recently puchased a PC with Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit on it . The software for PC runs fine , but you won't be able to change the setting through the software to disable the auto-start feature when PC starts up . You need to use msconfig or going to the Administration to disable the software to run in background .  
1	  this is a sorry piece of equipment ! It jams , jams and jams again . Color reproduction is not reliable , sometimes it 's great , then not so good - same ink cartridges . Back to Epson for me !  
2	  I was looking for a cheap yet good quality FireWire card for a work PC , since I work with video , I needed a card that could download DV footage to the PC . This fit the bill perfectly . I was worried at getting a cheap one since it could potentially cause system instability ( anything you add to a PC can ) , but this one had plenty of positive reviews , so I figured I 'd take the plunge . I popped it into a free PCI port , started up Windows 7 , and it was instantly recognized as a 1394 compliant device , drivers installed right away , and that was it . No need for a disk , just plug and play . The device functions as it should , have had it for a couple months now , and no issues whatsoever . In case you 're unfamiliar , the instructions are included and actually pretty decently written , although it is a pretty quick procedure . Windows XP and up should automatically recognize and install drivers for it , so you shouldn't need a disk , just plug-n-play .  
2	  I have used this headset several times in different locations and I feel it provides clear and crisp sound quality for both the caller and receiver .  
2	  I got this spindle specifically for an additional backup of my photos . From my previous experience with LightScribe DVDs I ` ve gotten an impression that they are some of the most reliable recordable optical media that I 've used , good enough for most of my archiving purposes . I chose these DVDs based on their Amazon reviews and ratings , and so far I have not been disappointed . Since I got them I 've gone through about a dozen DVDs and have not had a single corrupt disk . I 've burnt all of the DVDs on two of my Mac computers - one with an internal superdrive and one with an external USB-attached superdrive . I 've tested the burned DVDs on both my Mac and Windows computers , and they have all worked just fine . I 've used the LightScribe burner on my Windows HP laptop with a few of them , and it had worked OK - the performance of the LightScribe burner on this laptop has never been all that good , and over the years the final image has only gotten worse . I have never been a big fan of LightScribe . It has a very pale look ( worse than the e-paper ) , and inscribing the image on a CD or a DVD tends to be very finicky . From what I 've seen so far these Verbatim DVDs will perform on par with all the other high-end LightScribe DVDs that I 've used , but this has not been one of the main considerations for me when choosing the archival quality DVDs . Overall , these are very solid archival quality DVDs . No optical media will hold your precious data forever , but these DVDs will probably keep it safe for as long as there are DVD drives out there , and quite possibly much longer .  
2	  If you need a nicely priced up-converting DVD player , without all the bells and whistles , this is the player for you . You can definitely notice the picture quality increase ( when using the up-convert setting ) compared to the usual picture quality provided by standard def . progressive scan ( 480p ) DVD players . The higher the quality of the DVD transfer , the better it looks with this DVD player . With my old Sony standard-def player , it didn't make much of a difference whether the transfer was high quality or not . Now I can tell which DVDs received a good treatment or not . I have this DVD player matched with a Samsung HL-S5086W 50 " DLP HDTV and the picture quality is excellent . It pays to use an HDMI cable rather than the component video as the picture is sharper and seems to have deeper color saturation . I 'm very pleased with the purchase . In summary , this is a great low-priced player and does exactly what most people would need from it : up-converts your standard definition DVDs until you are ready to upgrade to Hi-Def DVDs and it doesn't bog you down with a lot of unnecessary options or complex menus .  
2	  This is my third set of Sennheiser Wireless Headphones . I tried several other brands ( Sony , RCA ) and had to return them . They did not have the range and sound quality of the Sennheiser systems . Weather on my TV or my computer system , the Sennheiser Headphones are worth the extra $ .  
1	  I bought a pair of these headphones from amazon last year , and i had them for about a month . i loved the sound , although it didn't go quite as loud as i had hoped , it was still very clear quality . however , the bass boost is a terrible idea , because it can't handle the loud blaring bass of most good songs , so it either overpowers the music so all you can hear is a booming noise , or the bass gets too low for the headphones to handle and it just sounds mushy . and the worst part was , the reason i only had them for a month was that the jack head fell off one day , making the headphones absolutely useless , so i complained to skullcandy , and 2 months later , i was finally able to get a new pair after quite a bit of hassle , only to find that just a few months later , the same exact thing happened . i went to put them on , and i noticed on my computer that my headphones weren't plugged in , but the jack head was still sitting there in the port . i know for a fact , i won't be getting another pair of these , and i 'd recommend you do the same . now , that 's not to say skullcandy isn't a great company . i love some of their other products . i 've had a pair of skullcandy 50/50 headphones for about half a year now , and they 're still working amazingly well . the best part about them is , not only do they last way longer than the skullcrushers , but they also work way better , and for almost half the price . the bass is much much better than the skullcrushers , and the sound quality is a lot clearer , and can go a lot louder than them as well . plus they have a volume adjuster on the headphones so you don't have to keep grabbing your mp3 every time you want to change the song or the volume . and they 're not big and bulky headphones , just simple little ear buds that work better than any i 've ever used before . basically what i recommend , is that instead of buying these , look for the 50/50 ear buds . they 're much better quality , and they 're way cheaper .  
1	  Disappointing as you cannot add to your reminder list . Records over everytime you use .  
2	  I have used this switcher for 3 months now , & I am very satisfied with it . It 's a handy item for growing audio / video set-ups . There are many video selectors with 4 or 5 inputs , but only 1 output . I have 3 vcr 's , 1 DVD recorder & 1 dvd player that I wanted to hook up to my stereo receiver & television . The catch was that I didn't want to loose the abilty to make copies of tapes , record tape to DVD or DVD to tape . To accomplish this without switching wires every time , you need a selector with lots of outputs . This unit fill that bill . The picture quality is not degraded by sending it through the unit . This is based on observations on a new Toshiba 24 " color tv . The tv isn't hi-def , but still a very good picture . While it is versitle & it 's back is covered-up with jacks , the selector it not too hard to hook-up & has a decent instruction book to provide various examples of how you can hook it up . The nicest function this item has is it 's signal conversion abiliy . You can hook a vcr 's or dvd recorder 's output to the JX-S777 by either a composite or S-video cable , and the selector can convert those signals to an s-video signal . Then you only need to run 1 s-video cable from the JX-S777 to the TV . This is handy for me , since my cable companie 's decorder box doesn't have an s-video output . I no longer need to change the input on the TV when changing the devices I 'm watching . There is no signal conversion for component video signals . As well there should not be . This is a really nice switcher . I 'm going to get another one for the office a / v system . Highly recommended .  
1	  System developed a " popping " & " crackling " sound and would shut itself down . Tried changing cables , cleaning inside reciever , this did not help . Would work for maybe 10 mins and POP & Crack and shut itself down . Paid almost $ 1000.00 for something I can not use . Onkyo will not return emails . Extremely bad Customer Service !  
2	  The Iomega 20GB Portable HDD ( USB 1.1/2.0 ) is an excellent portable HDD . This HDD can be connected using USB 1.1 or USB 2.0 . However , it is not recommended to connect it to a USB hub . It is recommended to connect it using the USB slot on the rear of the computer . Iomega only recommend format this HDD FAT32 . There is no carrying case sold by Iomega for this HDD , however , many third parties have carrying cases that fit this HDD . The drive build into the case is only a 4200RPM hard drive but it is fast using USB 2.0 and reasonable fast using USB 1.1 . Iomega sells a Firewire module for this unit that comes complete with a Firewire module and a Firewire cable .. I am using this HDD for carrying data from home to office , therefore , 20GB is large enought for what I am using it for . I will purchase a larger external HDD for data storage . SimpleTech has a SimpleDrive Deluxe model that comes complete with carrying case , power adapter , USB 1.1/2.0 cable , and a Firewire cable , all in one package .  
2	  With coaching from my son who is living in Germany for awhile , I bought a headset in order to talk with him , and others , using Skype . It 's truly amazing to be able to communicate with such clarity and comfort ( the headset is so lightweight you forget you 're wearing it ) , and the call is free through Google ! It 's the best buy I 've made in a long time . Thanks , Amazon !  
2	  I love this TV and it is more than worth the full retail price . DO NOT trust the rebate to ever happen . When I contacted the rebate center they immediately asked me for the information I had already submitted on their website . Rebates hardly ever materialize and I expect this one never will . Can you say Class-Action Suit ? It 's the principal of the whole thing and myself , andmost likely others are tired of " Rebates " that don't happen . I have all my copies , everything was mailed on time and accurately . Rebate = Rape of the consumer . I love my TV though .  
1	  Do not buy this product . I ordered this and it was shipped to me super fast . This product has the shape of the cartridge that goes into the printer , but the labels are not the same . Each color is securely enclosed in a plastic airtight sleeve which is handy . I say that because mine were leaking and had ink on the inside . I would never open those and try to clean off the ink and use them . I don't think that happened in shipping . I think they mailed me a defective product . It was thrown in the trash . I was going to try to get do an exchange .. I was not given that option . They mail defective product and then one is unable to exchange it for cartridges that aren't damaged . Avoid ordering this product . It is defective !  
1	  While I knew the flash drive I bought was a used one , it arrived containing the former owners data , some personal , and also had a missing part of its slide essential for inserting it into the computer UBS slot .  
2	  This new Panasonic brand battery breathed new life into my old wireless phone . I was ready to throw the phone out when it quit working ; but then I thought that just maybe it needed a new battery . Talk about rising from the dead ! This new battery was the salvation and saved me lots of time and money by not having to buy a new phone system . I wish all my electronics worked as well !  
1	  Bose 901 's have a very odd response curve , and the active equalizer is a specialized preamp of sorts to smooth out the sound and emphasize the low and top end . For some strange reason Bose hasn't gone digital with this preamp . Its 100 % analog . A pre-out loop needs to be available on your amp before you can set it up properly . The amp also should be a plain stereo amp , since the equalizer shapes the sound so much that if you connect a 2nd set of speakers ( b-channel ) they will sound very harsh and could even damage them . You get 2 slides , mid-bass and mid-treble . There 's also a low bass cutoff button , and not much else . The unit is rather large for what it does , and is an odd size that takes up more room in your stereo cabinet than it should .  
2	  I purchased the Roady2 and home adapter kit and activated the service with no problems . I bought a five year subscription to keep the monthly cost low ( you can cancel at any time without penalty ) . I 'm very satisfied . I feel that my commute time is now my time to unwind and explore new music . The instructions tell you to mount the magnetic antenna outside the car . Mine works fine just tossed on the dashboard ( I did place it on a magnet I have affixed to the dash for a nice tight fit ) . The unit itself is in a storage compartment in my Odyssey . When I park the car I shut the compartment , thereby concealing the unit . ( Check out the XM message boards for ideas on mounting ) . I play XM through the radio ( my unit is not directly connected and I do not play it through the cassette deck ) . Reception and sound quality is fine , though the other two options are supposed to produce even better sound quality . I do recommend the home kit because to avoid a car accident you 'll want to use the remote control in the car . Once inside the house , I hooked the Roady up to my stereo TV and it played fine through the speakers . I also hooked it up to a Bose radio with good results . Funny thing is-my husband says that with all those channels to chose from that I play elevator music ! ( My favorite channel is Watercolors , which is contemporary jazz ) . The only downside is that you 'll want to upgrade your car speakers and wire your whole house for sound .  
2	  This camera is perfect for the ' In-between ' user-the one who wants more capability than the small handheld pocket ones , but doesn't want to pay the $ 600-$1,200 price for the full up large digitials . The optical zoom is perfect-don't let any sales person sell you on a digital zoom-it is NOT the same , nor even close . Easy to use , tremendous pictures .  
2	  works great to keep film safe during developing cycle . I bought it just in case the photo cages was a bit loose just to ensure a tight fit and it does fit very tightly .  
2	  This product does an excellent job of indicating current power use , as well as historical use per hour / day / month / year ( estimated based on usage thus far ) . I have the usual criticisms about how it should come with a power cord so viewing the values would be easier .. but I 've gotten around that by using a power strip that can take upto 1800 Watts . I 'd highly recommend this product . For the price , you get more than what you get in a lot of other items you might buy on Amazon ! - ag  
2	  I just purchased my first iPod from our local Apple Store due to my fear that I would have difficulties with figuring out how to use it . Simply put .. not the case at all . Very easy to download iTunes to computer and they magically appear on my iPod . Download manuals from Apple web site . It couldn't be any easier . Tomorrow I will attempt to hook it up in my car with the mini-stereo cables that the salesman gave me . Excellent sound quality .  
1	  The backing does not separate from the film . We could not use the product . We even tried putting it in the freezer , hoping that the backing would somehow become stiffer . It still just tore up , leaving us frustrated and discarding the product .  
1	  This scope has a very small view . Not worth the price . I won't even give it as a present . Junk !  
2	  Good printer for the money , but it is not true when you say " All in one printer " this term we use with printers that can do1 . Print2 . Copy3 . Scan4 . FaxThis printer does 1st 3 so I might call it " Almost All in one printer " , I mean EPSON could have add a small modem port while putting all this scanning and printing hardware , I am sure it would cost less then a $ 1 to EPOSN giving the margin of being printer manufacturing giant of the world . Printer is fast but not fast enough as its peers like Canon , also printing speed mentioned in the book must be " Draft " printing speed otherwise if you could have more then one regular page in 30sec you might be printing a triangle or a single phrase per page :) okay lets talk about quality , I gave it 5/5 period , for a dirt cheap printer ( I got it for $ 30 from Staples . com ) it does meet or exceed any expectation you might have for a printer in this category . Scanning is good but software should have little more options but copy function is a killer , just press color or B / W button from the printer ( whatever type of copy you need ) and boom , you got a copy in less then a minute while sitting on your desk and without truing on the computer , cool isn't it ? No more going to store for a stupid 5 cent copy and waste of 1/2 gallon of gas ; not to mention the time wasted ( on invested ) . Complete waste of Ink as all EPOSN printers are ; it does a little version of head cleaning every time you turn it on , better keep it on to save the ink , use only 3 Watts in sleep mode since Epson Stylus CX3810 has earned the ENERGY STAR by meeting strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy . Remember printer manufacturers make money from the sales of ink cartridges not printer so these suckers drink ink faster then your fish drink water . ( this clich & eacute ; seems little far fetched huh ? ) this printer use Durabrite ink but I don't :) , I use compatible dye based ink cartridges from eBay ; the price and does the trick as per my requirements , shh .. don't tell EPSON ! I mean come on ; get serious here , why should I pay 4 times more for a ink that last 80 year ? I am sure I might not last that long myself :) you know I am not maintaining historical archive for the library of congress using this printer :) I use it for my every day work and most of my print out heading towards garbage bin after I am done with them ; in some cases they go out to postal mail where I am sure I don't need them for next 80 years . For Photo printing I always use 6 colors printing where as this printer has 4 basic colors so detail in photos are not that " detail " but again not bad either , if you print photos on good quality photo papers they came out as " keepers " .  
2	  this hub is 2.0 usb . this is working great with my MAC . you should own this one . very fast .  
2	  Exceeds expectations keeping hot liquids hot . I think the branding for Thermos ( now Thermos Nissan ( tm ) ) has been effective . I gain a small iota of comfort or perhaps nostalgia from the familiar cylindrical thermos shape sitting proudly on my desk basking in its stainless steel glow as if to say : " This is one phallus that will not fail you my friend . " The thermos is easy to use and clean .  
1	  Same your money , this is a real piece of garbage . I 've seen some real junky electronics come out of China , but this is top grade trash . It appears to have cost five cents to manufacture and works like one cent worth of plastic . I can't believe that amazon . com has it listed on their web site .  
2	  I just love this LCD . I 've been shopping around and checking out all the top brands . Then I saw side by side Sony XBr , Sharp Aquos and the Samsung . I had been alway leaning towards Sony XBR , but then I saw it next to the Samsung . Hands down the better of the three . The TV was easy to install and No hassle with the initial set-up . If I had to complain about it , it would have to be the sound . It sounds good , but it needs better low end . I would still love the TV even without the added Philips surround sound .  
1	  It was rubbish , I bought it from somewhere else and it failed to work for me , I tryed cleaning it but it still didn't work . I sent it back to get a replacement AND I still coulden't get it to work , I might just have been my P.C but I don't think that , that was the case .  
1	  Got it in the mail , attached it to my PCI card , booted up and is dead . Called Seagate and they said return it .  
2	  We just needed a basic scanner for documents and photos . I was worried about how compatible this would be with my G4 PowerBook running OSX , and it 's fine . It 's about the size of my 15 " laptop but much lighter . Getting power from the computer through the USB port is a very nice feature . We both found it easy to set up and use . It does a nice job with photos , and the OCR software is reliable . I suppose it 's slow , but it 's so convenient that we 're not finding the speed anything to worry about . As usual , Amazon 's packing is terrible , and when I saw the state of the box ( after the Post Office driver flung it on my porch , which was only the final insult ) , I was afraid the scanner would be damaged , but the manufacturer 's packaging was very sturdy and saved the day .  
1	  I purchased this clock radio several years ago - and immediately found that it did not receive the radio stations I want , at least not very well . Another radio on the other side of our bed tunes the same stations just fine . I also was annoyed at the beeps generated every time you push a button . I don't want to wakeup my wife when I change something ! My daughter just gave me a new Timex Model T308 clock radio to replace the Sony . The Timex works great , installed in the same location as was the Timex .  
1	  I wanted to use this as a backup device . However , when I copy files to it I always get a message that the transfer is not working and the files are not recoverable . Two disks insist that they are write protected . I have not been able to find that helps on the Castlewood site . This is the external USB 2.2 G drive  
1	  This my third set of headphones from Sennheiser in the PMX-70/80 line . They have all failed in the same way - loose connection at the headphone jack . After 2 months , this set is dead . I 'm returning it under warranty , but I 'm going to start looking for another brand . Strongly recommend you do the same . Update : Sennheiser denied the warranty claim because the headphones were not purchased from an authorized reseller . Be warned or stay away !  
1	  I bought this and it works . While a typical USB Flash will take 30 minutes ( or more ) to transfer a 1 gig file , this Seagate can do it in 4 minutes or less . The only downside to the Seagate is that it hesitates and does nothing periodically . I don't know if it is waiting for the drive to spin or struggling with seeking the data but it can be frustrating . Using this with the USB drive on my Philips DVP5960 DVD player is usually convenient . However , it can take forever and a day to fast-forward . It is easier to let the video play at regular speed , set an alarm ( for example , 20 minutes ) , walk away , and come back to watch after the alarm has beeped . The Sandisk Cruzer Micro can be had in 4 gig size and can also transfer a 1 gig file in 4 minutes or less . I have the 2 gig version and it never has the pause problem . The 4 gig Sandisk Cruzer Micro will cost you more than this Seagate but it won't hesitate and it will probably be more durable .  
1	  This is not an audio cable . I received a power cord . The picture is the wrong item .  
2	  I am happy with the film strip binder . It is strong and sturdy . The quality was great from the vendor . I 've had the product for a year now and I 've come across no problems with it as of yet .  
1	  I should like this unit . I think the concept behind the technology is great , but there is one basic flaw and it renders everything useless . I can't connect to download the tv listings . After speaking to customer support , they told me that the problem has been going on for three to four weeks and they are having problems with their ISP . What has been happening is that the moden connection always gets terminated before the listings have downloaded . Anywhere from 10-98 % of the listings make it , but then it ALWAYS disconnects . I tried over 40 times at various times during the day and night , but it never works . Without those listings , the unit is just a useless hard drive . Tech support said it has been going on for a few weeks and they don't know when it will be fixed but they are aware of the problem . So beware . I 've wasted a day trying to get it work and will now try out the Philips system .  
2	  This was a Christmas present for my 15 year old son . He has downloaded many songs on it and has used it every day . He takes it everywhere with the exception of school of course . He really has enjoyed it . I 'm glad I purchased it . Everyone should have one . It is small enough to put in your pocket but very powerful . Thanks for the great offer .  
2	  This is a great setup and the mouse design is much more comfortable for hands of all sizes . The only thing I would change about it would be to offer a left-handed mouse . Why is that so hard to find ? ! Not just for lefties , but what about those with injury or handicap who cannot use their right hands ?  
1	  This unit worked fine for 6 months and then one day it quit forever . it won't read a single dvd i own . Every single disc gives a read error . Way to go SONY .  
1	  I bought this model since it has a fat rebate which brings down the price to $ 10 . Good for the price . And the stability is not too far above the price level . Installation is relatively easy . Hooking the router up with my DSL modem and computer is trivial . Running the software on the CD is easy too . One thing though : since I use static ip for Internet connection , the quick setup does not support it so initially my Internet connection is not up . That 's fine and I know it since many such routers only support dynamic ip address on the Internet side by default . I manually configured that through its web interface and then its wireless and ethernet connections start working . Good so far . And I expect most people would be happy now . But since the default wireless mode does not use security at all which means someone could peek at what you visit or use my Internet connection , so I decided to add security to the router . Now the fun begins . It took me half an hour to figure our which security mode is useable - I finally chose WPA-RSK mode since this is the only security mode I found working ( after numerous reboots ) . But the story does not end here . It keeps dropping connection every 3-5 minutes . Yes , every 3-5 minutes ! This is virtually unuseable . I have to turn off the security feature and this works fine for only 20 minutes . The connection remains on and off periodically . My laptop is only two feet away from the router , so signal strength should never be an issue for me . I don't use any other features of the router , so no comments on other parts . For the price and basic functionality , I gave it 2 star . I wish Belkin had more reliable product , but it certainly disappoints me .  
2	  I was needing a headset for quite a long time , and I 've never been able to find one , but I got recommended this one , and after looking and looking , I 'd never thought Amazon would have it !  
1	  Unfortunately , this old model doesn't charge the iPod Touch 2nd Gen . The sound quality on these FM transmitters is terrible . I 'd say worse than 64k mp3 quality . It works though .  
2	  Nice and quiet . Works very well in keeping my laptop cool . Good quality and 3 year warranty !  
2	  I agree with one of the reviewer the color is not as shown in light blue but dark blue . And its probably not for wire under carpet and in room since it is hard to hide . its very thick and strong . But the 12 AWG wire deliver ! Also it is NOT solid copper wire , is braided copper wires . if that is a problem for you . It works perfect for my polk speakers though . I used GLS Audio Black Chrome Series " Generation II " Gold Connector Banana Plugs and all works perfect for the 5-way binding post speaker terminals on the back of the speakers .  
2	  I have the non-IS version of this lens , so I can't and won't comment on that feature . But the glass is superb . I 've taken probably 5 of my 10 or so best shots ever with this lens . I shoot sports and some other stuff . I had several " news " item shots with this lens published in various newspapers . It is a good all around lens , and makes a great combiniation with Canon 's 28-70 L ( or 24-70 ) . As far as sports , I shot a lot of basketball without lights in poorly lit gyms , and this lens coupled with good film came through . I 've recently gone SLR digital and only used this lens outdoors , but I liked the results ( I do have some digital camera tweaking to do ! ) . A couple of things about use . First , its better if you use a mono / tri-pod . On rare occassions do I use this without a monopod . It certainly isn't the heaviest lens in the world , but the pod adds more stability to your setup . If you don't use a pod , you 'll need to carry your setup by carrying the lens to minimize potential damage to the camera mount . Note that this applies to all EOS film cameras , the Digital Rebel series and the non-1D line . The 1D line of cameras are so heavy , you can probably get away with carrying the body only , but check that . I don't own a 1D ( _ ) and would use a pod with one anyway . The IS feature gives you the ability to shoot without a pod , certainly , but still support the lens on the camera when shooting as such . Since I don't have the IS feature on my lens , my pod comments relate to weight only . I 've heard someone actually say a pod is counterproductive to IS lenses ; since I don't own any IS glass , I can't comment . Check other reviews or do your own research if you think that will be an issue . The lens includes a mounting bracket that can easily rotate for portrait orientation shots . Most of my sports work is done this way . The auto / manual focus is easy to get to , and I 'd always be aware of how it is set and shoot accordingly . I go manual focus a lot , depending on the body I 'm shooting with , and its easy to work with . But you will find some of the fastest autofocus you 've ever seen with this lens , even on an early ' 90s film EOS body . One of my film bodies is a EOS 10S and , coupled with this lens , the autofocus speed was light years ahead of a late ' 90s production Nikon N90s with the " new " Nikon 80-200 lens . This lens belongs in every Pro 's and advanced amatuer 's bag .  
1	  I bought this product for my brother 's Kodak small digital camera . It takes him not more than 20 photos before the battery dies ! Absolutely unacceptable . Although I always buy stuff from Amazon , this is the first time ever I don't accept a product at all .. Regards , Wesam Al Nasr  
1	  I have now decided that this is the last HP product I ever buy . Terrible software , doesn't work as it should . AVOID AT ALL COSTS .  
2	  This is my first flat Cat6 cable . I 've been running the standard round variety for years . I purchased this to run under the carpet / along the baseboard of the living room in an effort to get my Blu-Ray player on my network for the propose of streaming Netflix and Amazon On-Demand Video . This flat Cat6 ended up being a great solution . I was able to conceal it with no problem at all , and it cost a fraction of the other possible solutions ( wireless access points , installing cable enclosures , etc . ) . I will admit I was worried about the cable having poor construction , seeing how the price was so reasonable compared to other 50ft . flat Cat6 cables I came across . To my surprise , the construction is top notch and it seems like it will last as long as any other ethernet cable , flat or otherwise . I wasn't expecting it to be complete crap mind you ( otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it ) , I just wasn't expecting it to be as well constructed as it turned out to be . Another unexpected bonus was that I actually like the looks of the flat cable so much that I 'm thinking about switching my other ethernet cables out to all flat Cat6 cables . The flat construction of the cable just makes it look cleaner and tidier then a standard ethernet cable . Its flexibility also makes it easier to manage if your trying to tie your cables together or neatly management them . So if you intend to run it out in the open or behind a desk you 'll be able to achieve a clean look and a avoid a rats nest of cables if you choose to manage your cables for a more pleasing look . So whether your interested in running your Cat6 under the carpet , along the baseboard , or neatly managing your cables behind a desk or computer , using a flat Cat6 such as this is the way to go . And yes , once you go flat , you 'll never go back .  
1	  This was a very disappointing purchase for me . Due to Amazon 's poor marketing , they offered this lens cover along with the Nikkor 55-200mm lens for an additional price . Well , the lens came with this hood . So essentially I just paid to ship it to my house and back to Amazon , approximately $ 15 ? The product seems okay but be wary of Amazon 's " good buys . "  
2	  Adapter is perfect for my needs for my older HP iPAQ device . Some older product parts are hard to find . Glad I found this one .  
1	  I ordered this headphone extension wire on March 31,2009 from Brainstorm Corporation through Amazon .. I paid extra money to have it shipped faster in just 2 days .. I got an email right away telling me they got my money . Its now April 3rd ( 3 days later ) and I still have no email telling me that my order has shipped , no email telling me the tracking number and no way to tell when it will be delivered . I contacted this seller a day ago and they responded immediately telling me they would find my order and tell me the day it shipped ( if it did ) and my tracking info and delivery estimate . They never emailed back ! So I contacted them again and now I am waiting here with no wire still . So far , I would say if you know this is a good product , buy it from a different store . This seller ( Brainstorm Corporation ) doesn't seem to keep track of customers or orders very well .  
2	  How they can sell this product at this price ? I don't know . Worked as advertised . Very pleased with the product and the price so I bought two .  
1	  I bought this particular dvd player for my son for Christmas . I thought it was a great deal but it turns out it wasn't so great . For one it will not play Disney DVDs and doesn't play all movie DVDs . It 's kind of a hit and miss thing . Will it play or won't it . You are better off buying a known brand even if it costs more .  
1	  Bought this player for my son at xmas . Lasted about 10 minutes then " file system corrupt " . Had a replacement shipped , this time I updated firmware on RCA website ( which they claim is the fix ) before even using it . Loaded music and got less than two hours use before " file system corrupt " . Dont waste your time or money . I have since bought the Sansa E250 . About twenty dollars more but it is a great and reliable player !  
1	  I bought this player about a year and a half ago . It worked great ( for about 3 months ) . It played all the DVDs and CDs . Unfortunately , it cannot read VCDs or CD-R / RWs . For most people that doesn't matter , I guess . However , only after about 3 months of light usage , the player started to act-up . Sometimes , it won't read the DVDs-the player indicated " no disc " in player . I unplugged it and it worked . Then , it doesn't work again , and I repeated the same procedure of unplugging . Finally , I sent the player back to RCA . Since it was still under warranty , all I had to do was pay for shipping . It came back after about a month . It worked , and then I started to see the problem again within a couple of days . I was confused . Why does it work sometimes but sometimes it fails to work ? So , I tested it out to see the prob . myself . It appeared that the disc tray motor sounded weak , and being unable to read the disc , I thought , could be due to the fact that RCA had provided a weak motor part . I was half right . I removed the plug from the UPS / power supply and plugged it directly into the wall . So far , I have no problem . I think I may have found a solution ( for now ) - the difficulty in reading the disc , I concluded , was due to lack of power [ believe it or not ] . Well , if you have the same problem , try unplugging it and have a dedicated power supply for this player . It might work . Beside this , the machine is good . It played every single DVDs I 've ever rented or bought . I have this hooked up to my reciever through TosLink ( optical cable ) . The sound is excellent-good proportion of sound from center , satellite , rear and subwoofer . It plays CD but it takes a second or 2 to skip to songs . Basically , don't expect it to play it like a real cd player . It sounded just as good though . I 'm getting rid of it now because I want a new and better player that also plays VCDs .  
1	  It is good to increase the screen real estate but any dialog boxes that appear in the center of the screen normally are split across both screens . This is annoying for log in or error boxes required with some software applications . Does not work well when you go to standby on a laptop and try to power up and use both screens . Set up was pretty easy  
2	  .. with the constant advances in technology , however , the latest camera you buy will tend to be the best ever . This is one great camera for the price . i tried the Nikon D50 , Olympus E500 , Pentax * ist , and went for the Rebel XT . They all had features that I liked but the Canon stood above the rest . If you like shooting in available light , Canon is head and shoulders above the competition . The speed of the camera is very impressive as well . I 'm not going to get into all the specs of the camera since they have already been covered . You can't go wrong with the Rebel XT .  
2	  Used pretty heavily over the past few weeks . No problems yet . I 'm not a aficionado , though , so you may want to look for someone more experienced .  
2	  I noticed these elevation feet are cheaper for mac version than pc version . Since they looked the same I went with the cheaper mac feet for my Alienware m17x . Here are the pros and cons : pros : 1 . Its straight forward to apply . Peel and stick2 . It does amazing job of keeping my laptop cool . My fans are working less because my laptop is venting very well . 3 . Very sleek and slim when folded down . For those that are not familiar with the Alienware m17x , its a beast of a computer in weight and size . I had to cut my laptop bag ( biggest laptop bag from bags . com ) with scissors to get my laptop to slide in . I was concerned adding these feet would make it worse . I was very pleasantly surprised when everything folded down and was able to fit in without a problem . Its elegant looking . 4 . Beefy . If this can survive 2years supporting the m17x , it will probably have no problem supporting any other laptop . cons : 1 . Matter of time until adhesive backing starts peeling off . But then again my laptop weighs like 15lbs . This can be fixed easily by using silicone . 2 . The rubber friction pad will eventually fall off . Again easy fix , just glue it back in . 3 . I should have paid extra for the black feet since white feet don't look good on the jet black alienware . How does one spend $ 5k on a laptop but cheaps out on little elevation feet ? .. I 'm shaking my head .  
1	  My experience was identical to that of David Yutzy . Simply put , the mouse never worked . Not even once . Ironically , like David , I 'm about to leave on vacation . Unlike David , I 'm not waiting to return this . I called up Targus tech support and while I am impressed with how quickly they took the call , their response was simply that I return it to the point of purchase and obtain a replacement . I have a better idea . I 'll return it , get my money back and buy a different product from a different manufacturer . One that actually works . From the look of some of the comments by other users on this product , I may very well have been saved the additional frustration of dealing with short inactivity timeouts . I 'll end by copying David Yutzy 's last line : Avoid at all costs .  
2	  I am not one of those Audiophiles so I cant speak to the technical aspects of this sub . It is a powered sub so it should deliver , right ? Well , this one will deliver a punch that will render your neighbors sterile ! And , with neighbors like mine , I just did a favor for the rest of the world ! Buy one today and help stop idiots from reproducing !  
2	  What can I say , it did what is is supposed to do . No issues at all so far , and I use a couple of these cables .  
2	  I needed a replacement cable for my GPS . This one of decent price and decent shipping time . Works fine so far .  
1	  The ones I ordered did not come with any sort of box , and no owner 's manual either . Since there were a Christmas gift , and I did not open the box to wrap them until after Thanksgiving , I am too late to return them . I will be more careful if I ever order anything remanufactured again .  
1	  I was not happy with the USB car chargers I purchased back in November . I bought 2 of these chargers because I planned on giving one to my mom for christmas and was disappointed when I went to use my own and it did not work properly . It would not charge my iPhone and my phone would keep dinging as if it had just been plugged into a charger even though it could have been plugged in for 30 min . I was not at all pleased with the product I received .  
1	  I had to return this item . Any movement in the area caused it to skip .  
2	  The first machine Shipped to me had the same problem listed in other reviews , that it did not hold setup inputs when the machine was put on standby mode . I sent it back and requested a replacement . The second unit worked perfectly . I reset the record input mode , put it on standby , Turned it back on and it was still set the way I set it . It seems Apex has some units out there with this problem . The record and playbacks were perfectly clear and crisp . The Audio was excellant also . I would recommend this unit for the price , However I would keep returning it until you get one that works properly . Also by reading these reviews I was able to download the upgrade patch and install it . I THINK APEX NEEDS A BETTER QUALITY CONTROL DEPARTMENT BEFORE SENDING UNITS OUT TO RETAIL  
1	  Didn't learn from the Classic ipod 60 , and bought this one .. was setting on a chair , and dropped it , so it started going crazy and when i went to fix it , they told me I 'll have to spend 2/3 of its price , as thr hard disk was shattered ! I don't know what type of a device shatters when you drop it from a 30 cm on a carpet .. but this is your ipod .. never gonna buy an ipod again  
2	  I am extremely happy with this keyboard . It has a better look then the pictures sitting at a desk , the light options are amazing . A +  
2	  We love the sound . and you are the best , fast service and delivery tks i will give you a # 10  
2	  I found this tape player to play very well ; the sound is clear and the reliability is very good . For those that have cassettes and can't find them locally , I would defineately recommend this tape player !  
2	  these headphones are great . They have great sound quality , incredible bass for headphones , and they can BOOM if you want them to . they are also very comfortable to wear for olong periods of time . That said , they were designed as studio headphones , and so are beefy and a pain to carry around . So if you will use them for at home listening , i strongly recommend them , especially for the price they are at . But , if you need headphones for a portable music player , i suggest that you go with something a little lighter and smaller , like the Bose Triports or the Sony VJR-700 's .  
2	  I have spent over 2 hours filling out how I rate products that I bought through the last year or so and then you have to have 20 more words in order for me to submit my ratting . This is it .  
2	  After buying 2 wrong wires / cords finally I have the right one ! Item does what it is suppose to with no problems  
1	  Quite possibly the worst computer peripheral I have ever purchased , and I have bought worthless stuff before . Spend an extra $ 2 and get something that will shut when you put batteries in it .  
1	  panasonic has not fixed the problem with the ho7 errors and dead machjines . Mine died 1 month after warrantee expired ! panasonic wont even admit the problem . don't buy one !  
2	  I got this for use in my car . I hide my Ipod in between seats and the remote control takes over the commands . Easy to use and no problem for the Ipod to get the commands . The only con is that is hard to see the buttoms at night and hard to set tight in the wheel , otherwise , great product .  
1	  This CD burner worked for about 4 burns and then just died . It won't even read a CD . I think the laser is messed up . I 'm going to take it back . Don't buy this one folks or do and see if you have a better experience than I did .  
2	  We have had this radio for about two years and didn't use it much until camping this year . It was really handy for checking the weather reports and charging cell phones . Don't expect to charge a cell phone without a lot of elbow grease , but it does work . The radio has pre-programed weather frequencies which gave us a choice of regional weather reports . Also it was educational for the kids who learned that even without household outlets they could generate their own electricity and run a radio .  
1	  The design is very nice . Fit nicely on your lap if you can get it to work . Wheel assembled and connected to PC , installed software . I ran F1-2011 , NFS-Hot Pursuit , and Burnout Paradise , none could detect it . My OS is winXP 32 bit . No good .  
2	  I bought this and did not know what to expect . I paid 10.99 for it and I feel I got a freat deal ! I love it easy to use . No need for al the extra brushes its all in one place .  
2	  I searched through thousands of entries for 3 ( ! ) days looking for a cheap memory upgrade for my faithful old Dell XPS . There were LOTS of ' off-brands ' ; but I finally found a CRUCIAL ! I suspect it was overlooked because it has the word ' UNBUFF ' in the description ; all the others omit that word . I looked it up . All are unbuffered except those that are buffered and they'er NOT backward compatible .  
1	  After taken some pictures I received an " err 2 " message . I talked to Sandisk tech support to try to resolve the issue and did not have any luck ( after about a hour on the phone ) . After a couple days of waiting for my claim to be approved I received a " cannot approve your RMA at this time because we don't have proof of purchase on file with Sandisk " This would have been nice to know at the beginning and not 2 days later ! I think they do this on purpose . Another point is .. Sandisk makes you open a Ebox with them to process your return and they are suppose to EMAIL you when there are updates . I never got an email ! I am now waiting to see if I can even get this returned or not ? This is the second time a Sandisk has malfunction on me . I don't recommend buying Sandisk to anyone . This will be the last one I ever buy !  
1	  I originally submitted my review at a 1 out of 5 ; however , after speaking with Canon support , I was surprised they are offering to replace my printer free of charge . Amazon doesn't seem to allow me to update my rating ( which i would based on the support call ) . Ours broke down near the warranty expiration , and Canon is shipping us a new one . I almost didn't call support , thinking we were out of luck - now I 'm glad I did . Canon 's support is also first class ; I particularly like the feature where they call me back instead of waiting on hold for the next tech rep .  
2	  First of all , this is an old school radar detector without any of the bells and whistles , and for what it was designed to do it excels . Unfortunately in this day and age there are speed cameras and anyone with a GPS enabled unit has gotten comfortable with the silence from learning the false returns . That being said , if you want the best long range " radar " detector this is the one . I have logged thousands of miles with this unit on cross country trips and locally ; it picks up the bogey way ahead of schedule . The one comment on the Amazon page is that it displays a nice metal case , but in the description it states that it comes with a " molded zipper travel case " , and thats what you get . I would have liked the deluxe metal case in the picture and what I have read about it other reviews . Amazon should remove this picture as it is misleading . To make this detector outstanding the GPS feature with speed cameras should be added at some point , but for straight radar detection the STi cannot be beat .  
1	  I bought these headphones 2 days ago for a flight from england to australia . I 'm so disappointed with the sound and the NC that i had to log on and add to the surprisingly small number of 1 star reviews . NC is barely noticable beyond noise already cut out by the bud design . As soon as i got home i compared them with my other headphones . NC headphones obviously aren't as good as the non NC equivalents ( Ive found out from reviews that this appears to be common knowledge ) but i 'd expect the sound to be better than my 5 year old ipod headphones which i found - they 're rubbish in comparison . Compare them to my iphone headphones and the mdrnc22s are shown up even more . As a massive sony fan I 'm gutted ( mainly coz i can't send them back without flying back to england ) .  
1	  I bought this as an alternative to the expensive PalmConnect adapter , for my Vx . The driver works with System 8.6 , very shaky with OS . 9 , extension conflicts in OS . 9.2.2 , and it doesn't support OS.X.The support is none existing .  
2	  Product was delivered on-time and I have great reception . My only disapointment involved the connectors supplied with the antenna . Three different connectors were supplied with the antenna but the ' push-on to screw-on ' coaxial connector , which was required to connect the antenna to my stereo receiver , was not one of them . So .. after an unplanned trip to Radio Shack , I was able to install the antenna .  
1	  This was a great camera for the 2 weeks it worked . My son was using it the second time and when he came back to play again it would not turn on . We replaced the batteries , set the reset button to no avail . He is so upset . he wanted to bring it on the vacation and now will have nothing . save your money  
2	  Okay , here 's some cool things to do with the PalmV : 1 . When I 'm with a group of friend they want me to look up what movies are playing , and when , and what 's playing at which theatre , all of which I do with Vindigo . ( e.g. , no hauling around the daily paper just to get movie listings , and no annyoing MovieFone sessions . ) 2 . When I 'm at a carwash or in a waiting room or on the can I read the New York Times front page , The Onion , Variety front page , and some astronomy newsletters , with AvantGo . 3 . We like to eat out . I have every Zagat 's guide ever published ( had to pay 29.99 - for all ten of ' em ! - but you can search by distance , type of food , etc . ) and I check out new places . ( again , that much less paper to haul around . ) 4 . I like astronomy . I use the nifty program Planetarium ( which I downloaded I think at ZDNet and costs twenty bucks ) which has rise & set times for all planets , sky maps and a great alt / azimut star finder . 5 . It 's an awesome scratch pad . WE were at an art museum and I copied down the names of the artists we thought were cool , so we could go to the library & read up on them later . Same for grocery lists , etc . 6 . Of course there 's the datebook and the address book , which justify the price alone . The coolest computer ever .  
1	  Well the Zen was purchased as a gift for my father for father 's day . My brother liked the features so much that he purchased one shortly thereafter . However we have been unable to get one that even turns on . I 've downloaded all the product support from Creative Labs , as well as the new firmware . The frustrating part about it is this is the second unit that is DOA . My brother purchased his at a local store and works flawlessly , were my father 's came from an online source . The stupid thing will not even turn on . And it takes " 4 " weeks to get a new one ? ! I 'm not really happy at the moment . My brother 's functions awesome , no trouble at all , and he loves it . My father 's however is well .. well you get the point . Sorry B & H. ; I spoke with the tech folks in " India " and they suggested a trick to get the batteries to fire up . The problem they said was the unit had sat too long and run out of juice . So they recommended that I plug and unplug the unit 15 times waiting about 3 seconds before replugging the unit . Amazing it worked and things are running just fine . So the problem is B & H ; Photo Video .. must be why their price is so low .. over inventory on the shelf too long .  
2	  this is a great router . set up did require a call to dlink but was effortless - they were around at 1 in the morning and the call only took about 8 minutes . our laptop sure seems accessing the the internet quicker . it has not failed in 3 weeks of use like our old router used to . one the coolest features is the usb port so you can create a wireless printer network with any printer . 2 thumbs up overall .  
1	  Do not buy this product , does not work ! I tried for hours transfering files from my old computer to my new computer with no luck , program kept shutting down giving me an error message without explaination . " Easy " anything but . Save your time and money .  
1	  I 've had lots of problems with this MP3 . Forget about customer service , you can only find FAQ , which are not what you need . Problems : 1 ) The endless menus are annoying2 ) Bookmarking takes more than four screens3 ) WATCH OUT ! If you let the battery drain it will be dead FOREVER and new ones cost $ 44.4 ) These units go dead dead dead , you have to reset , losing everything5 ) They have tried to do way too much with this little thing . We 'd much rather have a player that SIMPLY WORKS6 ) For audio books , it does have a nice feature : If you shut it down , it starts again right where you turned it off . You can also bookmark , but that takes 4 screens and a minute . 7 ) You can't recharge them with AC , you have to use USB connection that is very lengthly  
1	  The FE-180 seams to have a major problem with the picture quality in this camera . A review at CNET says the pictures are soften but that 's a politely way to say fuzzy . I took over 100 pictures indoor , outdoor close up far off and in some shots the pictures are clear but non of them are sharp . I got a lot of out of focus shots and tried using the digital stabilizer mode called DIS which is really effective in low light scenarios . But I could never get a sharp picture . Another issue I have is that after you take a picture it only stays in the display for about 1 second . If I want to view the picture I have to switch to the viewing mode , making sure my subjects were looking at me . I returned it getting the Canon Powershot SD600 which works perfect ; it 's worth the extra cost to take pictures that last a lifetime .  
1	  Did not work . Did not have the correct cables for connecting to my new TV . After buying the correct cables , it still didn't work .  
2	  This binocular is my favorite . Good clear optics with a nice wide field of view . Feels great and secure in my hands . Very well made and well worth the money paid . The dark green color looks good .  
2	  Frys had these in plain netgear refurb brown box for only $ 34.99 during the labor day weekend sale . I picked up three cause I wanted to use two as a repeater / bridge and one as the main base station . With the standard netgear firmware , this router is pretty average , and slow for an N router , but upgrade the firmware to the latest DD-WRT v24 sp1 , you just made this cheap N router a blazing $ 300.00 + router . The DD-WRT firmware gave much more configurable options , one actually increasing the tx range . Sorry neighbors . :) My throughput is between 230 to 260 mbp ! Signal stays in five bars ( excellent range ) . This router is great for tweaking and would only recommend it if you are able to get this router at a cheap price and upgrading the firmware to DD-WRT . I say it blows away the Linksys WRT54G .  
2	  For this price I thought it was an off-brand equivalent battery . But it is exactly the same as the one that came with my camera . My camera is a Sony DSC-HX1 and this is the battery for this camera . It sounds like this battery works with other devices as well .  
2	  Product is fine , great value , paid extra for faster shipping , took longer than regular shipping !  
2	  ok , this product is amazing . if you have an HP it doesnt work right away , you have to go to control panel , under appearance and personalization . go to ajust screen resolution go to display go to the one you want  
1	  Against my better judgement , I went with this model - despite its scathing reviews . As soon as I opened it , I knew I was in for it . I could hear a ball bearing rolling around loose in the internal canister of the spool . I held it up , and the screen rolled right out with absolutely no tension whatsoever . Needless to say , it did not roll back up . I took off the end cap , and noticed right away that the plastic clutch drive was broken in half . I put the cap back on and called amazon . Fortunately , I ordered through Amazon - as the gave no hassle whatsoever . I just packed it back up , and put it on my porch for UPS . They 're sending me one more . If it works , cool . If not , I 'm being refunded , and going with a different company . Buyer beware . If you 're going to buy this one . Buy it through the Amazon warehouse . They are hassle free .  
1	  A large portion of these cameras will not play back the video they record . Since this is one of the core functions of a camcorder , this product fails miserably . Yes , it has cool features . Yes , the price is great . None of this overcomes the fact that you can't use it to playback recorded video . So far I have had an opportunity to test out three of these cameras and all three failed in the exact same way . What are the chances that the one you buy will have the same problem ? It looks pretty probable .  
1	  Length : 0:46 MinsLogitech has a known issue with this remote and other remotes . ( search online , " harmony remote back sticky " auto fills on google . Google requires several thousand searches before the query becomes a suggestion ) Something breaks down in the plastic and the back of the remote becomes sticky like its covered with goo .. See quick clip posted with this review . Logitechs solution , they sent me emails saying have it fixed by a third party , re-cover the back with plastic sheeting , buy a new remote from them at 10 % discount so its only 30 % more than you can buy it online . Will never buy another product from them . I have remotes that are 20 years old and the plastic shows no sign of degradation . Up your quality control logitech .  
2	  Well it is my time to say how good or bad . Well first auto focus is fast , 3.5 is bright enough , 4.5 is faster than the kit lens . Image quality is great all through the focal length , super sharp at 60 to 90 mm with tripod . I got this for my E510 at Cameta Camera for only $ 129 . I was worried to get this from Cameta Camera because of the price but after a few weeks of wondering I just bought it from them . It came well packed with front & rear caps + lens hood in good bubble wrap , thanks Cameta Camera I will buy from you again . Soon I will get the 70 to 300mm . Factory demo EXCELLENT CONDITION . Works like new I have photo to prove it . PROSFast auto focusVery sharp imagesLarge hood for blocking excess lightReasonable weight ( Metal mount ) better than hard plasticSmooth & firm zoom . CONSNot so good in low light conditions & nightFront barrel rotates for focus not good for circular polarizedMinimum focus distance too long 1.5m . Over all a wise choice and must have lens , with Olympus Cameras IS system I wouldn't worry too much about a tripod for daytime use .  
2	  Just as the title says .. I love these MoFo 's , so much I own 3 pair , the first pair I bought at Radio Shack rebranded for RS 10 years ago and they are still working like new and sounding bitchin ' thru many hours of snowboarding and daily use at a full time cleaning job for over 8 years , so I would say I have had some time to test them ! I do like the RS version better because it came with a case , 4 sets of ' plugs ' , and the little sound tube was removable making changing of the plugs much easier but was also 20 bucks . I do like that these ' plugs ' here do not have an inline mute control , which is a huge PIA and the direct entry plug is very nice as well , better than the old style bigger L-plug . The bass response is so sweet , you should hear an 808 on these ! Overall sound quality is quite hella amazing and for such a low price , how can you go wrong ? ! I think these ' plugs ' blow away many hundred buck earphones that I have heard ! Koss has been around for over 40 years and they know their stuff ! Quality for a great price ! ~ REEDSBUD ~ 4.11 ~  
1	  This is for anyone thinking of buying a Handspring product . I purchansed a handspring deluxe through amazon 3 weeks ago . I have had nothing but trouble with this device since I purchased it . The worst part is you have to pay just to speak with anyone in Handsprings customer service dept . I have spent over $ 50.00 trying to get help with my hot synch problems . All I got was an agents who could barly speak english and did not seem to be that familar with the product , who kept putting me on hold to ask a tech person what to try next . I should have heeded the other warnings that were posted on amazon regarding this brand . Now I " m stuck with an expensive paper weight . Don't make the same mistake I made .  
2	  Great cable especially for the price . Upgraded from analog D-sub cable to this DVI cable , immediately noticed a difference in quality on my LCD .  
1	  Owned it for a few months . Suction cupped it to my car dashboard . Didn't keep the PSP very sturdy , as it vibrated constantly and I have a brand new Civic which is a smooth ride . Eventually , the hinges came loose after about 3 months .  
1	  My G5 can see the UPS as attached through the USB port but the downloaded software will not recognize the UPS unit . Had to send it back because it is functioning only as an expensive surge protector .  
1	  WASTE OF MONEY , NO BASS LIKE PEOPLE SAY ON HERE ! AND THE SOUND QUALITY JUST IS HORRIBLE !  
2	  Since I have multiple sets of headphones and a phone headset with a cord , buying three cord managers in one made sense . Because this product is not in the shape of something silly like a rabbit or fish , the cord manager doesn't look tacky . It 's simple , keeps my headphones from getting tangled or catching on things , and the price is inexpensive .  
2	  I have the Discgear Selector 100 FX which was given to me for Christmas . This is an ideal storage solution for discs . I also have a 5-shelf rack that I use for DVD 's and it is a pain to find the disc I want . Not so for the Discgear Selector . Not only is it a snap to find the disc I want , its nice to have the selector pull the disc out of the machine so that I can just grab it . Storage density per given volume of space is a big plus with the Selector . There is no other storage medium , that I have found that comes close to storing 100 discs in such a small area . I intend to buy 5 or 6 more of these units as it will take that many to accomodate my movie collection . My only issue with the Selector is the price , but you get what you pay for . I can most easily recommend this by telling you that it is well worth having several of them .  
2	  Wow . Let me tell you , this is the best thing since emo . It 's a wonderful thing to store ten to twenty CDs ( depending on the bitrate ) onto one CD that you can take anywhere . Think about this :> > The unit is stylish and the screen is easy to read . >> It does work with every mp3 CD that I 've put into it . >> .. it is an amazing bargin . >> You can take your whole music collection with you where ever you go on about seven CDs . >> It simply does not skip . Whatever you do , even with regular CDs , no skipping . I was throwing it across my room and there was no skipping . NO SKIPPING ! >> You can organize your music into folders and play only the foloder that you want to . >> MP3 's play without the CD even moving . Crazy . There are some things that you have to know about the player though :> > The controls are a bit hard to get used to , but a little practice and you can search your whole database of music . >> Multisession CDs cannot be played , but you can store some songs onto a CD-RW , play them , erase them when you 're finished and write new ones onto it . >> The headphones it comes with are [ bad ] . But that 's it ! I have no idea what these other reviewers are talking about .  
1	  this speakers sound funny is like a small chip radio sound  
1	  I have been using the card in my Canon 450 .. twice the camera issued a message , while taking pictures , that the card was unformatted .. Once I get this message I am locked up until I power the camera off , unseat and reseat the card .. then it seems to work fine until I get the next message .. So , I purchased another 8GB card from a different vendor and so far have not had any problems . I got the message once while shooting continuously and I filled the cameras memory .. might be that this card really isn't a class 6 as advertised ..  
2	  I debated between investing in a used Airport card and the recent version of the Linksys WET54G ( version 3.1 ) in order to have my old G4 iMac connect to a wireless network . After reading this information ( search : plantphys . info / advice / wet54g ) , I decided to take the plunge and buy the Linksys product . The instructions from the website were great , and my G4 was connected to the network within minutes . The only modifications that I would make to the instructions on that website is to ensure you enable the encryption if it is present on your network and add the network 's password . One issue that I had with the adapter after it was running was that I needed to reset the adapter after I had turned off the computer and my wireless network when it was not in use . Once I upgraded the firmware to the most current version ( found on the North American website ) , this problem went away . If you upgrade the firmware , you have to click on the " help " tab during the installation process , which directs you to a page where you browse for the updated firmware file that you have already downloaded onto your computer or key drive . I gave this product only four stars because the company should have provided instructions for Macintosh users , and the process of upgrading the firmware was not as straightforward as it could have been .  
1	  I too had read the seemingly stellar reviews of this transmitter . I was looking forward to using it on a road trip . What a disappointment . I don't even live in a big city , tried it a variety of places during my drive and tried all of the frequency options . It was almost impossible to hear the music over the static . Now I am in the process of returning the thing to try and get my money back . It seems like others have had good luck , but going from my experience I would say don't even waste your time and money on this thing .  
2	  Exactly what I needed and at the right price . Was shipped and arrived much sooner than I anticipated .  
2	  wow , this lens pens is really great . My lenses have fingerprints on them and it just takes them away easily .  
2	  What could be more brilliant than being able to go online to the Harmony website , choose the IR remote profiles for every piece of gear in your AV system , have all the necessary commands linked together for one button selection of the desired activity ( watch TV , watch a DVD , listen to music , etc ) , and then download all of that complex programming into the Harmony 880 via a USB connection from your Mac or PC ? The process is so well engineered that it almost makes you giggle at its genius . All of that programming could take an entire afternoon with other fancy remotes ( like the Sony Remote Commanders that I fussed with in the past ) - the Harmony 880 gets it all perfectly set up in an hour or less , and you can return to your online profile at any time to quickly update the remote for changes you may make in your equipment . The 880 is especially suited to DVR operation , with the button mapping working very well with TiVo systems - something that many other remotes do not do well . The writing on some of the buttons is very small - something my wife complains about - but you eventually learn the layout and don't need to see the labels . Forget changing batteries - the remote charges itself in its cradle ( with a slick little circular LED to help you find it in a darkened room ) . There is also an intellegent built-in help feature that will walk you through the steps necessary to get your components properly managed if a device is somehow set incorrectly . That can happen if someone manually switches an input or turns a unit on or off without using the remote . The help wizard works incredibly well . Before buying this unit I had an earlier model - the Harmony 680 . One day after a couple of years of use it just died . The extra few dollars the 880 cost were worth the added convenience of the charging cradle ( the 680 chewed through batteries regularly ) , and the color display which is easier to read . Otherwise they function in much the same manner . It was interesting to find that when I went online to program my new 880 , all I had to do was update my profile to change from the 680 to the 880 . I then went straight to the download , and in a minute or so I had all of the functionality of the recently deceased 680 perfectly mapped into the 880 . If only everything this potentially complex could be made so simple . Nothing else ( at this price ) comes close . I heartily recommend the Harmony 880 , and will surely buy another one if this one ever dies on me .  
2	  I bought these for myself last Christmas .. and I love them ! very tiny and inconspicuous . Nice sound quality , as well .  
1	  The unit I got was bad straight out of the box . The directions did not have the problem listed in the trouble shooting section . The temp read 99deg F all of the time . They do not want you to call tech support but look on their web site at FAQ . This part of their web site does not work for this unit . Finally got their tech support on the phone to find out that they did not know anything about their equipment . They just told me to send it to them or return it to the place that I bought it . Needless to say I returned it and bought a Lowrance . It worked perfect . I believe it is the same as the old Eagle units . Same mounting and everything . Much better .  
2	  I bought this camera for two purposes : 1 ) to replace an older VHS camera and 2 ) to use for converting my VHS tapes to DVD 's . I give it 4-1/2 stars for # 1 and 0 stars for # 2 . ( In my research before buying the camera , I managed to miss the fact that the GS320 does not have AV input , so can't be used to convert analog to digital . Rats ! ) However , for everything else I wanted , I was very satisfied . Other reviewers have pretty well expounded on the pros and cons . I 'll just say that the quality of pictures ( both video and still ) that we get with this camera is really great . When I first got the camera , I handed it our son who is studying Film Production and works with professional camcorders . After fiddling with the controls and looking over its features , he expressed great delight with my purchase . ( Yess ! ) It took me a while to figure out the menus and I haven't enough experience to handle the manual control options well , but overall , I would highly recommend this camera .  
1	  I had a Zen Touch 20Gb that I loved , but after 2 1/2 years of hard use , it stopped working . So , I bought this one . It was great when I took it out of the package . I downloaded all the programs and hooked it up to the computer to charge . After it finished charging , I tried to download music on it and I couldn't . No matter what I did , my computer would not recognize the player . I kept getting messages that the player was not detected . I tried another computer and I got the same results . After researching the problem and calling the company , I found out that this is a common complaint with this product . I am so disappointed and I am returning it .  
1	  I bought this for my Canon about two weeks ago . While the leather is attractive and shiny , it does not do justice to the camera . I spent a lot of time trying to find a slim camera that is easy to slide in my jacket pocket or my wife 's purse and out to take photos quickly and with ease . Well , first off , this stiff case makes the " quickly " out of the picture . The camera fits into the case very tightly , and the little slot to run the camera strap is too tight . So you have to spend a good amount of time to take the camera in and out of the case . Additionaly , the thick front magnetic flap of the case it too thick and adds bulk to the dimension . I like that it is magnetic , but the whole wrap-around is unnecessary and over-kill . Ideally a point-and-shoot camera should have very soft and thin leather ( that fits like a glove ) . I use this case only for storage of the camera , but prefer not using it on trips ; I know that defeats the purpose of the case becasue you want to protect the camera during use . Please note that other than the camera this case will hold nothing else - certainly no accessory , media card or even a toothpick !  
2	  I have had no problem with this cable I use it for my Xbox and my picture and sound quality is great . Can't beat it for the price  
2	  I had put this cd player to it 's test .. and the results have proven positively remarkable . Bumpy busrides and fast pace walking has never made it skip with it 's 40 sec . anti shock . So it 's no wonder , the positive reviews everyone has written . The design is perfectly sleek and compact . It is one cd player , that is pleasing to the eyes as it is to the ears .  
1	  I got to the Amazon . com site through a direct link from SimpleTech 's website . The Amazon . com site does not provide any technical info on the module-and the great price is due to the fact that it is not the RAMBUS module you think you 're getting , but an SDRAM module that is NOT compatible with the Gateway 700se / 1.8-2.0mhz . I have just sent the module back to Amazon . com , requesting a refund . Their top-notch customer service usually comes through with snafus like this ..  
1	  I received the Etymotic 6is from Amazon today and was really excited to get them . I am using them with my Ipod Touch . But when compared with my Ipod earbuds .. they sound terrible . They only come with 2 earpieces ( the long flang type ( you better have a long ear canal ) and the foam type . Yes there are other tips you can get .. but you have to buy those " extra " . Plus I noticed that these need " filters " that cost $ 15 to replace ( what ? .. no thank you , if I paid this much it should last ) . I was expecting good sound and ok Bass given some of the complaints I saw on these reviews . What I got was painful ear buds , tin-like sound and no bass . It would be uncomfortable to wear these for more than 10 minutes since the triple flang tips are so long and go dangerously deep into your ears . When people say no bass and mids were missing , it is WORSE than apple earbuds which come with my ipod touch . Why pay to get worse sound ? Instructions said to wet the tips and twist into your ears to get Bass . I 'm sorry but if I have to do a " procedure " to get good sound , then these things are not worth it . Take my warning .. don't get these . Maybe there is a break in period , but if they don't sound and feel good right out of the box .. I 'm done . Keep your money and check out other earbuds out there . I hear that Ultimate ears 5 pros and Shures E4c are much better . I am going to try the UE 's and let you know .. soon .  
1	  I 've had to put forth herculean efforts to get any resutls out of this card . Aside from the fact that it initally locked up my HP laptop ( until the beta drivers arrived ) , I still can't get it to reliably connect to the WAP . What is most frustrating is that the adapter often " sees " the network , but won't connect . When it * does * connect , I only get a range of about 10 feet before the signal drops off . Overall , this has been a nightmare . Avoid !  
1	  Sounds like this product is really hit or miss , depending on your computer . I tried to install the software on two different computers ( both with operating systems supposedly supported by the software ) and the software won't run on either system . I 'm getting the same ' Can't find photo viewer ' error mentioned in another review . Looks like I 'm just going to have to eat the cost of what I thought would be a good Father 's Day present . Don't buy this product . Do your research and buy something else ( unless you just feel like gambling ) . I wish I had !  
1	  I bought this remote about a year ago and immediatly was having problems . First of all the batteries that came with it were dead . After replacing it with fresh batteries the remote had a hard time learning the different functions of other remotes . I kept getting error messages for my TV , DVD , and reciever . After about 3 hours of programing the remote , It would forget the commands just as fast . Even reprograming and replacing the batteries didn't help . Since the remote was still under warranty I decided to return it to the manufacturer ( Thompson Multimedia ) . Boy was this a bad idea . During the past year I have made over 50 phone calls to customer service and they sent me back two wrong remotes ( cheapest ones too ) So about a month ago Thompson Multimedia finally sent me a RCU1000B . I immediately went to the store where i bought it and begged them to let me exchange it for the Sony RM-AV3000 . The sony remote is twice as [ much ] but definately worth it . It is awesome and it works great . If you want to buy a piece of junk , buy the RCA 1000B . If you want the best universal remote that works , get the Sony .  
1	  I would look elsewhere for a camera unless you don't mind using the flash all of the time . The auto focus ( when not using a flash ) on this camera is very poor in anything but very bright sunlight . I 've taken several shots in very well lit conditions and the images come out blurry . You pretty much have to use the flash all of the time . I believe Fuji addressed this problem in another camera ( I don't recall the model ) .  
1	  dont take this one . i have it . its display screwed up twice . it happened to all my friends who own it . to be more precise , a thick band appears to the right and it slowly grows blocking enitre view . bad customer care . very few customer care centers in usa . if anyone wants to buy this , i seriously suggest you to take extended warrenty . am not sure whether this is the case with all acer 5000 series . an intelligent guess would be , YES .  
2	  Do you have a pocket PC ? Than you can use it to transfer photos from the camera to your desktop much faster !  
1	  I am sorry I spent my money on this product . It does work as an auto transmitter and works OK as that . What I really wanted was something that charged my iPod as well but this item doesn't do it , even though it is advertised as such . When it is plugged in to my car and iPod it gives a message on the iPod screen that it doesn't function as a charger . Could have spent a little more somewhere else and gotten what I wanted .  
2	  for the price you can't beat it . if you buy the same cable in radio shack will cost you a whole lot more , i am buying all my cable online from now on .  
2	  A friend told me about purchasing this cord from Amazon . This cord has made such a difference with the HD and audio quality . The picture has improved and the audio is awesome . I would recommend this to everyone .  
2	  i got this player 2 years back from singapore where its sold as DNE-611 and i have no regrets at all , this player simply rocks . i have used the player extesively for jogging and have not had any problems with song skipping and not to mention the radio reception which is pretty good . This player is top notch as far as build Quality goes and would recommend this player . I dont use the atrac format although its a superior format and saves space , I 'd rather burm my mp3 cds than convert them to atrac and use them .. I saw a reviewer saying that he is reducing the rating by one star as its made in malaysia , this is stupid coz sony manufactures in malaysia and so does AMD , Intel and the most electronics manufacturers ..  
1	  I received the Sony DCC-E345 DC adapor and put it to use to power a CD player in the car . Product initally worked for a short time then started to work intermittently after a couple of uses . After a couple of days teh product stopped working altogether . I would not purchase another DC adaptor from Sony . Sony DCC-E345 Car DC Adaptor with Selectable Voltage Switch  
1	  I could not resist buying an 32-inch LCD Flat-Panel for $ 600 on sale . However , for some reason on a music channel the sound would go in and out . Before it went out , it would make a clicking noise . A Vizio repairman came and replaced the motherboard . This did not correct the problem . Instead , a different problem emerged . In addition to the old sound problem , now when the TV turns on , it is automatically muted . ? Have tried to get back in touch with Vizio customer service but have been given the run around . No one in the company seems to be able to connect us to the right customer service dept and then when we called the dept , no one returned the message we left . Trust me it 's not worth the hassle . Just pay the extra $ 200 for a better brand and be able to sit down and enjoy your TV in peace .  
1	  I bought this for the COD game ( PC ) . Why did I buy it ? The speakers are all very flat and I didn't want to put larger speakers on my game table . All I can say is the sound just isn't that good and the subwoofer is below average at best . It is probably better to spend a little bit more and get better speakers for superior sound . Right now , Amazon has the Pinnacle Speakers SUBSONIX 5.0 for only $ 249 . It is a steal and it is a much better buy than this Sony system .  
2	  Works perfectly ! Plugged it into the phone , turned it on and the phone took over . I now have over 500 mp3 's on the card plus 30 some Java apps , not to mention the pictures .. I have no idea of what the access speed is rated at , but the delay is not too long to wait to load up 25 CD 's worth of music . ( about 10 seconds ) The phone is rated for 512 mb 's , but this 1 gig card works just fine !  
2	  I am using this fan to cool my voltage regulater in the mother board and this little fan moves a lot of air . It did what I wanted it to do and is really quite as well . Very happy with this product .  
1	  I have had this thing for a little over a year it has been subject to paper jams consistently during that time . I think the print quality is generally good , but having to open the thing up and pull the paper that has been pulled about an inch in after every page is frustrating in the extreme . Find an alternative  
1	  Don't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you , it 's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws . Here 's what the other reviews ( written by Sony employees ? ) and the literature don't say :* E-marker doesn't seem to work with AOL ; you have to not only use another browser , but also set that browser as the default . * When you plug the emarker into your computer , it " automatically " loads your marks into the site .. or at least that 's what it 's supposed to do . On 3 browsers and 2 different computers , I haven't quite gotten this to happen . * Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers ' inadequacies , they ( over ) designed a Flash interface to get your songs that doesn't quite work either . Simple HTML would have been fine , guys .. Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0 .. this is the first time I 've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true ..  
1	  The product , with no brand name , looked like what I used in my camera . After a shoot I went to remove the battery and could not get it to slide out . I ended up super glueing a piece of plastic to the end of the battery so I could pull it out of my camera . By the way camera is a Konica-Minolta A200 .  
1	  This product works amazingly well on my Palm E2 ! However , Navagator 5.0 , which is what comes with the product , is already out of date . The maps are old . And in trying to update the maps , I find that the Palm E2 is no longer supported . It seems the software requires a more powerful device with Navagator 6.0 . GREAT ! Just great . Larry Coffman  
1	  I purchased these mounts for use with my Onkyo surround sound system because it was convenient that they were on Amazon and I could complete my order all together . Upon trying to use the " universal mount " system , I found that they didn't bolt up to my speaker system .. correct capscrews were not included . Further , if I tried to fit the capscrews I needed for my speakers , the counterbored holes in the " universal mounting " system were too small to accept the head of the bolt . I ended up going to K-mart and buying a " Universal mounting " system there that worked and did a great job . Maybe they work for other surround systems , but they don't for Onkyo .. not very " Universal " eh ?  
1	  Ordered this machine impulsively when my old HP T45 began to sound like a machine version of the ' death rattle . ' It was a amistake . Poor scanning , slow printing , ink eating and - overall - a truly inferior product . I returned it and bought a Canon Pixma MP530 for about $ 60 more and am VERY pleased with it . I believe that HPs heyday as the premiere maker of domestic printers and multi-function machines is over . Don't do what I did - Home work first , THEN purchase !  
2	  I 've had this camera for a couple months now , and have taken a couple hundred photos so far . I can totally agree with other reviews here that this is an excellent camera .. * The " night portrait mode " does a great job of popping the flash to fill in the foreground ( subjects ) while leaving the shutter open for about 1/2sec to burn in the background . This feature produces really good results in parties and other darker rooms . * The long-exposure manual modes do a really nice job of uniformly exposing the shot , completely without any artifacts or other noise from the CCD . * This camera , with a little work , can be made to work with Linux . .. .. .. that explains the sprocedure . Being a Linux user myself , this was very important to me .  
2	  definitely a must have if you want a quality DVD burner thats low budget and still works great . Havent had any problems whatsoever .  
1	  I 've had this darn thing for less than three months , and the latch broke yesterday . I 'm not hard on it at all ( in fact , it was simply sitting on a shelf for one whole month due to a break in classes ! ) . This is a worthless piece of junk . Don't waste your money .  
2	  It is very clear and visible when applied . I messed up applying it the first time however got it right the second ( good thing there 's 3 ) . The s-pen is fully functional with it , however does not have the same feel as if it were naked which is expected unless you get an expensive glass protector . It is a fingerprint magnet like many other protectors , however it is extremely easy to wipe off or clean . Price : 5/5Clarity : 5/5Feel : 4/5  
1	  This strap might have been a lot more comfortable if they re-styled it a bit . The place where the neoprene joins with the strap is very bulky and hit me right on the collar bone . So my neck was happy , but it chafed so much on my collar bone that I had to take it off in minutes . I think the neoprene should have been longer and the side straps shorter . Also , the neoprene is very thick and bulky-much thicker than it appears on the photo . Don't buy this unless you have a lot of room in your camera case to put it .  
1	  I ordered these 2 months ago and Amazon still does not have any in stock . It says that they are available in 24 hours but they have told me several times that they can't get any .  
2	  Good Quality heavy duty Door lock motor . Came with All parts required to install , including cable to run to the alarm .  
1	  A nice system , very elegant design and performance .. no complaints there . A bit costly and the HD DVD Drive has seemingly buggy audio playback with HD Disks . For the price , as with most electronic devices , you expect some baked-in price for the customer service that comes with the package . On this piece ; you are throwing a fair percentage of that unit cost out the window . Have called TOSHIBA Customer Support 3 times on a single issue . System will not recognize the TV Tuner that is part of overall unit . Not a buy-up but ; sold as ' part of the package ' . I was transferred to " Level 2 " support 3 times , waited on hold for 20 minutes 3 times and was promised a " call-back " within 4 hours . That has taken place over five days since I received the computer one week back . To date ; nothing , no call back , no email . The last time I called , I mentioned that I was ready to return the system on a poor Customer Service basis alone . Same result ; no call back . It is a bit disheartening .  
1	  The first time I plugged this speaker in , it blew out and the batteries began to ooze all over the counter ! So I returned the item and got a new one . The new one did the same exact thing after about an hour of use ! Now I am out of the Amazon return time and am out $ 65 bucks . I will definately pay more attention to Amazon return rules , as they make it very hard to return items ! Lesson learned about these speakers and Amazon ..  
2	  I recently purchased the Speed light 580EX II . I don't have money to plunk down on a gizmo just because some magazine drools over the product specifications . Im a simple guy , and I just want a light unit that will allow me to grow my skills and be capable of doing what I want it to do . I dont have the time or money to hire a Geek to explain the operating guide to me . I figure for the price of this unit , I should be able to put batteries in it and go ! If you do buy it , thats what you can expect from this flash unit . But I really suggest you learn to use all of its flexible settings , and you will not be sorry with your purchase . It has been easy to use , and I strongly suggest you enhance you purchase with a good diffuser . You friends will drool at your great pictures . There are plenty of knowledgeable reviews on this flash , please read them . I am just an average guy who does Photography as a hobby . I consider this unit as one of my best buys !  
2	  It did just what I wanted , had no problems . I can take and use it any car , love playin my own music  
2	  Bought this player in Jan 06 . Picked the Creative player after doing a bit of research on all the larger MP-3 units . When i got the unit in the mail , it was very easy to set up and run . The screen is nice , crisp and clear , even in bright light situations . There are only one item that i would like to see fixed with this player and that is the controls . The slider / selector touch pad is difficult to master and prone to erroneous inputs . Other than that , ive been quite pleased with it .  
2	  Great cable . Available in different colors . Fast shipping and sturdy easy to use boxes . True cat6 that is easy to punch down and terminate . I dont have any cool scientific facts on transfer rates , but I 'm sure it will do fine for all non-NASA-spec things .  
1	  I got one of these last month and had to return it after using it for a couple of hours . The headphone jack had a bad connection so you have to twist the connector around to get sound . The player refused to power up after the first shutdown and this problem comes back intermittenly . Taking out the battery and putting it back in seems to correct the problem . At one point , the screen display went blank after pushing the power button but hears music playing after pressing the play button . I am going with the Rio Forge .  
2	  I 've had this camera now for over a year and it is awesome . First of all to the people complaining about the battery life , you must have a faulty unit because my batteries last forever . I am always taking pictures and very rarely have to change batteries . I spent 4 days in Vegas and the Grand Canyon last year and took over 600 pictures and never even had to replace the batteries and that was also with constantly looking at the pictures on the screen and downloading them to my laptop without using a power adaptor . The pictures I have taken are awesome but you need to take the time to learn the camera options . For example you need to learn when to use the flash or change the shutter speed to get good shots . Its not complicated but most people don't bother to do this and then complain about poor pictures . Its your own fault . I even had a professional photographist complement pictures I have taken with this camera . The zoom is awesome . I have taken pictures of things over 1500 feet away and they look crystal clear . If you take your time and learn to use the many features of the camera you will be extremely happy with the results .  
1	  Hooked myPlayStation 3 80GBup to mySamsung LN40A650 40-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with RED Touch of Colorand the screen flickered really bad while playingCall of Duty : World at War . The entire screen would cut out as well as the sound . Makes me wonder if this HDMI cable can fully support 1080p or not . At least it was cheap . You get what you pay for .  
2	  I have owned these speakers since 2007 and they are still going strong ! The sub woofer delivers good bass and the satellite speakers produce decent quality sound . Overall , you get good performance at a cheap price !  
1	  I purchased the subwoofer when it still was 79.99 and NOT $ 159.99 when the price was DOUBLED earlier this year . I had to return my 1st unit due to the fact that it would not automatically shut off when the radio was turned off . Tivoli Audio replaced the unit and it works fine . It really enhances the sound of the Model Two especially when connected to my iPod . However , IMHO , it is NOT worth the current price . Sorry Tivoli , but doubling the price was NOT a good idea !  
1	  Hello Amazon people .. I didn't want my real name showing up & now I can't cancel sending this review . Please either revert it back to my nickname or delete it . Many thanks . The first one I got was skipping and jumping . After much prolonged back and forth with their hideously bad customer service I got my unit back " repaired " but it actually was no different . After more back and forth with their horrendously awful customer service I got a new unit . It was fine for a while but now it has this strange sound issue . Sometimes the sound lags behind the picture , then it catches up , then it lags again . Or , sometimes , there 's no sound at all and I have to cut the power and try again . Anyone want my crappy Cyberhome DVD player ? If not I 'll be throwing it out the window .  
2	  got the package on time . Items found as described . Head phones are good but not as good as the my sony wireless headphones . I did not use the transmitter which I got with the package since I have a sony IR headphone set and my old Sony transmitter works fine for supplied headphones . This product does not include power supply just in case if you don't know .  
1	  The auto switch technology the make reference to is placing the handset on the headset cradle .  
1	  I loved the mouse . I loved the LED lighting . It was smooth and fit my hand perfectly . I loved the dual mode with the click of a button . But it lasted less than a year , and I 'm a moderate user at best - I don't even game . So very , VERY disappointing durability . Especially for the money spent . I wouldn't recommend buying it .  
1	  first : WHY are there back and forward buttons under my spacebar ? I had to build a plastic cover to KEEP FROM HITTING THE GARBAGE instead of the space bar .. it is SOO irritating to NOT BE LOOKING AT THE KEYBOARD , flying away and all of a sudden LOSE EVERYTHING because yer thumb hit the friggin bac / forward button .. second : WHY IS THERE A START next to my shift and ctrl keys ? WHY ARE THERE NON TYPIST KEYS ON THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE ? who THE HELL asked for those things ? they ALL COMPUTER CONTROL BUTTONS should be waay out of the way so people typing scripts and LONG FORM NOVELS do not lose work and time and attention trying to deal with extra buttons that destroy what we do and interrupt my brain .. other than that , they keys feel okay , I miss my keytronic 1985 ergo board I had last century , it was MORE designed for ten finger typists that did 200 pages ON MECHANICAL TYPEWRITERS , a day .. it is comfortable , that one thing I will give it .. sadly it appears all keybds designed after a certain year all have these misfit keys placed in the WORSE POSSIBLE PLACE .  
1	  I ordered and PAID for a 2 GB mini SD card for my niece to use on her mp3 player . Unfortunately , I received a 1 GB card instead . I 've sent several emails to the company ( including one via Amazon ) with no response . Don't order from this company or you might be very sorry .  
2	  This was easy to connect and has been working fine for a few weeks now .  
1	  This is the suction mount that came with my C330 and it probably is too good at sticking on the windshield . I had it on my windshield for a month , then I tried taking it off and I just couldn't for the life of me ! I ended up ripping apart the rubber and now have a nice imprint on my windshield , and of course the mount no longer sticks as good as it did before . If you 're planning on putting this mount on one place for the rest of its life then this mount is great . Otherwise remember to take it off from time to time . I am ordering the dash mount now .  
1	  I am on my second Simon 3 and I have the same problem as with the first one . After a couple of months the voice prompts which announce which sensor is open , alarm , etc starts announcing the wrong location . Then the clock cannot be set because the hour announce is gibberish . I have the GSM cellular model and I am concerned that the corrupt voice data will not alert the call center with the correct issue that may arise . The Simon 3 has problems . I was told that the only fix for the first install was to replace it . At my cost . The first one started going bad after one year . This one only took 2 months to do the same thing . Basically speaking , it doesn't work .  
2	  Maybe Maxell has redesigned the cord since the previous set of reviews , but it is working great for me . I was very hesitant to buy the the cord because of the past poor reviews but figured it was worth giving a chance since all I wanted to do was be able to listen to Napster while running on my treadmill at home and my other alternatives were either 1 ) buy an MP3 player ( expensive ) or 2 ) crank up the volume on the computer loud enough to be heard over the motor of the treadmill ( not too nice for the rest of the family ) . I have the cord stretched to it 's full 20 ' length , from one room into another , with no loss in sound quality and the connections have all stayed tight and never popped loose ( something that has surprised me given the tension on the cord ) .  
1	  I purchased a Palm TX in Nov 2008 and an extended warranty from N.E.W. Unfortunately , despite my hardcase , my screen cracked when I dropped it . I called N.E.W. , was told the cracked screen was covered under my policy , and was promised a return label would be emailed to me . The next day , I had not received it , and I emailed customer service ; however , I did not receive a response . On the third day , I called again . I was informed my file could not be accessed without my contract number , even when I not only told him it had been accessed two days prior without the contract number , but also gave the case number I had been assigned that day . At one point , he even asked me why my name field was blank on his screen . Of course , I had to point out I had no idea since I did not work for his organization . I finally asked to speak with a supervisor . His exact words to me were " She is going to tell you the same thing I am . " Despite this inane remark , I again asked to speak with a supervisor . Although this employee did at least appear to be competent , she informed me the first employee I spoke with who had told me the Palm would be repaired under the policy was incorrect . When I asked exactly what was covered by the policy , she responded only the electronics if it suddenly stopped working . I told her of my past few days of experience with N.E.W. When asked for the names of the people with whom I had talked , I told her I assumed an organization of the size of N.E.W. tracked that information on their computer system . In fact , she not only knew the names of the 2 people besides herself with whom I had spoken , but she saw the email correspondence which was never answered . Finally , I told the supervisor I could understand why N.E.W has such low ratings on Amazon . DO NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE YOUR MONEY . They are incompetent . Amazon needs to quit selling such a poor product .  
1	  Though I like the keyboard , I 've found two serious problems with the mouse . First , it is very sensitive to movement . I 've tried making some adjustments but it is still difficult to control . Finally and more importantly , the mouse burns a set of AA batteries about every 8 days . I only use the mouse about 6 hours a week so I should be getting a lot more battery life . I 've bought other Logitech products and have been pleased with them but in this case I wish I had bought another brand .  
2	  Exceeds expectations , incredible package for the price , works fine and is a solid laptop and rugged enough for my travels .  
2	  This is a really nice compact camera from Canon . The picture quality is excellent . I have tried some night / day shots and the pictures are great . The zoom is the pretty much non existant at 3x however that depends on what you use the camera for . The build quality is excellent and I really love the 3 " display . I find the ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice to get used to it . The camera is very compact but I never had problems to get a good grip and a steady hand . The images have excellent true color and are indeed sharp . I would definetely recommend an accessory kit for this camera which includes a nice small leather case and an extra original Canon battery and its available on Amazon . The accessory kit turns out to be cheaper than buying the individual components and its contains original Canon parts especially the extra battery . Also get a SD card with large enough memory . What comes with the camera ( 32MB ) is really a waste . Still don't understand why these camera manufactures throw in such a small memory card . But overall a great easy to use and a smart looking camera that produces wonderful results .  
2	  My ADSL got disconnected whenever I picked up the phone . Not anymore with this filter .  
1	  I was very happy when I first bought it . It exceeded all my expectations for a unit like this one but troubles started after one year . When the ink ran out , I promptly replaced the cartridges and I started seeing almost blank pages as the output . I cleaned the head several times , followed all tips / techniques on the net but nothing could solve the problem . Now I have to throw the unit and get a new one . I do not recommend this printer at all . Anyone who wants to strongly recommend this printer , please do so after using it for some time . As I said before , it works great until you replace the cartridges .  
1	  This is the second mp3 player that I 've had from philips . The first one never worked and this one died after 5 months of use . When you get the " flickering of death " nothing in the manual works . My last philips product EVER !  
1	  The problem with this device is that the ball is very smooth and will slip if it gets the least little bit of grease on it from a skin cream or even eating a potato chip . I use the mouse all day and had to switch to a trackball to avoid repetition injury . The only other mouse I 've used is Logitech which is an optical mouse and requires no reqular cleaning . I 'd definitely not buy Microsoft if you 're a heavy user .  
2	  I prefer the standard twist hood mounts , but as the nifty 50 doesn't have one the mechanism this uses is ok . As was already stated it is a bit shallow . The retention buttons annoy me a bit because I tend to squish the hood as I 'm trying to take it off which makes it harder to take off , but they did good for what they had . I do wonder why canon couldn't make an adapter with standard twist instead of this though . 4 stars due to shallowness and the odd mount .  
1	  I bought this card by mail order and was told by the salesperson ( not from this store ! ) that I could download drivers for 2000 and XP . Once it arrived and after a futile search of the net , I realised that there is no support for NT architecture . Who wants to use a sound card on an antiquated operating system ! OK to be fair , my band did a bit of recording running 98 and Cakewalk and the ISIS card performed pretty well . But now I am stuck dual booting with 98 if I ever want to use my soundcard ! Take my advice , don't buy this card and check out whatever product you are thinking about thouroughly so you don't get caught out like me .  
1	  I just love my canon printer . The print quality is great and the inks are inexpensive . As a matter of fact I have bought four canon printers ( i250 , i350 ) and today I am going to buy another one for my sister . Canon keep up the good work . I have to add that I hate Epson and all the other brands in the market because the inks are just too expensive .  
2	  It fits my 15.4 " gateway notebook , but barely ! It 's a little too snug for my taste . If you have a thin 15.4 " notebook this sleeve should be fine . I have a thick laptop and the sleeve is very tight on it . Again , it works best for thin laptops .  
2	  No problems at all in the installation and performance . Great value for the money and increased my computer speed a very noticeable amount .  
2	  This is my first home theater system and I love it . I had difficulty getting the tv volume to come out of the system . I bought 2 hdmi cables from cables-togo on Amazon $ 24.00 for both . One from the theater system to the tv , and one from my AT & T dish dvr box . Then all I needed to do was hook up pair of rca jacks from audio on theater system to audio on tv . Done . I have a big room 12 x 24 it sounds real good , I read reviews from people saying this is better for small rooms , no complaint from me . I bought this 2 weeks ago for $ 249 and thought it was a great deal , the price has dropped now twice to $ 199 .  
2	  I wanted a small , efficient camera that I could throw in my purse and use on a whim , and yet still count on for great pictures . I hated my Olympus Camedia b / c of the shutter lag and the lack of image stabilization . On the whole , my pictures with the Olympus were fuzzy images of people post-smile . The Canon SD800IS has been a whole different experience - sharp images , even in lower lighting . I really enjoy taking it around with me , and it 's renewed my interest in photography . My only complaint is the battery life , but I plan to buy a spare battery to carry with me .  
2	  I love how this things looks and what it does ! It 's small and compact , perfect for taking anywhere as well as for sock stuffers .  
2	  The sound quality from my Toshiba M200 laptop headphone jack to my receiver ( using the best Monster cable ) was weak had you could hear a slight hiss . The first step ( based on helpful reviews here ) was to download the Izotope Ozone plug-in for Windows Media Player 9.0 ( they also support other players too ) . This noticably improved my 192Kbps WMA and MP3 files sound . You can download the free seven day demo and hear for yourself . Guarantee 'd you 'll buy this once you hear the difference . OK , enough said about that . Next I couldn't resist coupling this with the Xitel Pro-HiFi link . I bought this for the Optical connection . The great thing is that it comes with a 30 ' optical connector which allows me to kick back in my living room chair several feet away and play the best quality music from my laptop that I 've ever heard . This is a winner - buy it !  
2	  These work great in my Canon SD800 , A720 , and SD1000 . Noticeably ( and measurably ) quicker than the standard SD cards .  
1	  Both suction cups ripped within 2 weeks ! Used only a few times . Do not buy this product ! Looking for refund .  
1	  The screen when first pulled out did not pull out smoothly , but in a sort irregular pattern . Immediately afterwards upoun inspection , dents could be seen all along the entire case . Also , the entire case had been twisted and bent . Then to send it back , no matter with how many people or how hard or differently we pulled on it , the screen would not retract .  
2	  We bought a really expensive pair of earbuds and they didn't compare to the sound of these . These are wonderful . Very pleased with the look , feel and definitely the sound !  
2	  Make sure that you really need this adapter . Amazon shows it as an accessory for GPS units that aren't compatible with it .  
2	  It was cheap , it came fast , it works and it 's easy to use . Someone probably just wanted toUpgrade . I 'm just using it for film class , so I didn't need anything special . Thanks  
1	  These PS2-USB " adapters " are the worst thing to ever come from mankind . Why ? All they do is switch over wires to a different plug . They do not " magically " make ps2 products usb compatible or the other way around . Almost never in the product description is this told . Many people have bought these to be very disappointed that they don't work . On the other hand , if you know you have a compatible keyboard , they work well . Make sure your keyboard states it 's compatible with usb-ps2 adapters before buying an adapter ! The work of actually converting formats is done by the keyboard , not the " adapter " .  
1	  I 've been a long time palm enthusiast . Had a professional and then a Vx . The m505 has all the utility of the Palm Vx but the screen is horrible . I could barley see it without the backlight engaged . I 'm returning it and going to upgrade to the IPAQ . I suggest you to the same ..  
1	  I have had my ishuffle for 1yr and 2 weeks . The battery no longer holds a charge . To get the battery replaced is $ 65 , almost the cost of a new shuffle . Is the shuffle worth an extra $ 65 a year to have a battery replaced ? I don't think so .  
1	  I received the product damaged - it didn't work . I went through the procedures for returning the product and sent it UPS . I asked for a replacement . Still haven't received one as of July 12th 2010 .  
2	  I 've had this sub for about a week now . Was delivered overnight ( ! ) using a free trial of Amazon Prime . My home theater uses the Polk RM series ( 7 speakers ) , Denon AVR , and a Panny 110 " projection system . Bluray from a PS3 , HDDVD from the Toshiba HD-A35 . Set up the system using the Digital Video Essentials disc , which has some great audio setups as well as video . Up til now I 've been using a 10 " sub and been mildly satisfied with the audio impact of both Bluray and HDDVD . With the 12 " Polk , I now hear a HUGE difference between the DTS-HD lossless audio offered on most of my Bluray collection compared to the Dolby Digital Plus on many HDDVDs . I 'm now going to convert my collection fully over to Bluray because of it ! This sub is a great deal for the price ; tight , punchy and very immersive !  
1	  I 've owned and used this camera for almost 8 months , since Christmas 2003 . I liked it at first , as it was easy to use and operate . It became quickly apparent , though , that it sucks batteries dry at the speed of light . Whenever I changed the batteries-which was often , 99 % of the time I also had to reprogram the camera-a huge pain if you want to catch a particular moment . The 3x digital zoom zooms to 3x , there is no in-between , no control at all over the zoom . Over the last month , the zoom has worked sporadically-not working when I wanted and needed it the most . The picture quality is good , what you would expect , I think , from a 3.3 MP camera . But , overall , I wish I could get my money back .  
1	  My fiance bought me the iPod shuffle for my birthday . We tried it on THREE different computers and it didn't work on ANY of them ! So , we tried to return it and bought an iPod Mini . What a mistake ! Within the first couple of hours the screen 's contrast went to nothing - and we even had it on the darkest setting . Then , the next morning the screen decided to be visable again . BUT , on the fourth day , the thing just froze ! I couldn't turn it off or anything ! So , it made me feel like those days back in college when I had to use Apple computers and the disk drive would freeze . They never had a disk drive eject button . Why does Apple do this stuff - doesn't make sense . So , this one is going right back to the store . I would like a digital player , but just won't buy an Apple one again .  
2	  Upon turning this TV for the first time i hated to admit it but i did experience the " clouding " issue that other people had posted . So i decided to take the TV on a 2 week test run . and i am so glad i decided to do so . first let me say that it is now 2 weeks later and the " clouds " ( caused by some backlighting issues ) have all but vanished , and i was left with a very clear picture no matter what i was watching . even dark films that had space scenes . Video games look truly awesome on this TV .  
2	  I bought this for my boyfriend and he used Pelican products before . I personally was impressed with the quality . Definitely worth the money ! I 'll suggest this case to anyone .  
2	  Very dependable - it does exactly what 's expected of it , with reasonable read / write speeds . Perfect for cameras and digital audio recorders .  
2	  So far this computer ranks the highest of any of the 7 computers that I have ever owned . I would recommend it to anyone needing a lap top .  
1	  I got a multi-pack of these and burned CD 's for stocking stuffers for my family . I think they are thicker than normal CD 's because they got stuck in 2 CD players .. one is in my car and I still can't get it out . DON'T PURCHASE  
2	  This tiny MP3 player is perfect for audio books . I get one at a time from library , load it to player through computer , and am good to go . It starts where left off last time , and volume buttons easy to work . Battery lasts for hours , and is rechargeable on my computer . Works well in car , too , through FM transmitter . I use Monster Radioplay FM Transmitter , bought through Amazon for about $ 15 . The FM radio works well , too , for strong local stations anyway . That said , I find the screen hard to read in daylight-and impossible in sunlight . And if I wanted it for playing music , in anything other than random order , I imagine I would be disappointed , because the display is limited and the directional buttons are hard to manipulate . But it 's so tiny that it 's very handy to tuck into a pocket and listen to while exercising , commuting , or whatever .  
1	  This is first time to use non-original toner . I hoped I had a equal quality product . But it is not . The ink spread and the printed papers looks unclear .  
1	  Apparently the bluetooth " standard " is not a standard at all . After a great deal of fighting , I was finally able to pair this with my motorola headset . But that was as far as I got . I can't get it connected and constantly get the response that a connection could not be obtained . Once I got connected as a fluke but only for a " good " strength connection even thought the headset was 2 inches away and the connection did not result in any response with the software I wanted to use it with . Connection dropped spontaneously a minute later . Complete garbage . However , if anyone knows of a bluetooth adapter that actually works , I 'd love to hear about it .  
1	  My husband bought me this camera ten months ago as an early Christmas present . While the picture quality is not the greatest , I have found it to take decent photos for the price . It is easy to use , although , like all point-and-shoot cameras , it is at times difficult to get a clear picture due to unsteady hands . My major complaint about this camera is the cheap build . My husband accidentally dropped the camera from about five inches off the ground , where he caught it before it made full impact . Still , the camera will no longer turn on . When I contacted Kodak , I was told that it would cost $ 90 to repair , which is nearly what my husband paid for it in the first place . I am considering their service upgrade deal where you turn in a broken camera for a discounted new one , but after this one broke so easily , I am unsure that I want to spend the money on another Kodak just to have it break like the first one . While the camera takes decent pictures , it has shoddy workmanship and poor materials and can break upon even the smallest impact , and the cost to repair it is simply not worth it . Edit : My mother was able to wiggle some parts in the battery compartment to make it work again .  
2	  Met my expectations : 1 . not too expensive . 2 . it 's plug-n-play3 . the usb receiver can be attached to the mouse when not in use4 . mouse response is good . The only little concern is that the mouse could have been a little bigger / longer so that the inside of the palm can completely rest on the mouse as opposed to just part of it .  
1	  I bought this keyboard for my 83 year old mother . She loved the big print on the keys . Unfortunately , it was not even 6 months old when keys started failing . I would not recommend purchasing this product .  
2	  In the world of plasmas this probably isn't anything is considering buying these days , but i have to tell you I really like this little TV.I selected this TV because I have its big brother . Sadly , just before the plasma boom , I " upgraded " to a fabulous , hundred pound , flat screen television . This little one looked just like , so I bought it . Oddly , this little guy is better behaved than its brother . The clock automatically sets based on a station signal . The big one is supposed to , but refuses . While both sets have sleep timers , this one has a wake up ! I use it instead of an alarm clock . You can set it to come on and go off at a set time and on whatever channel you want . The only glitch is that if you don't press a button on the remote ( any button ) it will shut off in an hour regardless of your programmed time . It has more inputs than the big TV , with one input set available from the front . Cosmetically this bugs be because it doesn't have a cover . I have a VCR and a DVD player hooked up to this set , and the color and clarity of the picture , which is adjustable in many ways , is perfect for my bedroom .  
1	  all i have to say PIECE O JUNK mic broke after a couple months the rest worked but it wasnt very good it sounded staticy oh yeah and the cord broke after my brother vacuumed it on accident but i think a headset should survive after that  
1	  I guess maybe it was my own fault but I assumed all of the new scanners on the market included USB connections . This one is going back ! This is probably an o . k . scanner but most computers offer USB connection for plug and play operation and find it pain to hook it up through my printer .  
2	  These are so great ! I saw them in the Apple store about two years ago for a lot more money . For $ 40 on Amazon they were a super deal , which I pride myself on finding . I am really picky , but the are so pleasing to the eye ! Can you believe it .. speakers that double as sculptural elements ? ! The sound quality is quite good , especially if you 're used to speakers without a sub-woofer . The volume goes up quite high . I haven't even felt the need to turn them up enough to be at full blast . I will be using them with my laptop as well as my iPod . They will be replacing my big home stereo , which I 've hardly used since I got my iPod anyway . The power cord has quite a large " brick " attached . I hope I can hide it behind my desk or TV stand . Also , the on button is in a pretty awkward place ( behing the sub-woofer , among all the cords ) . I don't understand why they didn't put it on the left speaker where the volume buttons are on the right one . Still , I love them !  
1	  I was drawn to the sleek design and thought the price wasn't bad either . I bought it for my office where it doesn't get much use ( until after business hours ) . I am constantly fighting with static and station reception and have had to hang the antenna wires all over everything for a clear signal . Now , at about 8 months , the CD player has completely stopped working . This unit no longer reads , recognizes or plays any CD 's not matter what I do . So , now I own a nice looking , static playing radio that if you 're not careful will trip you up in it 's antenna wires .  
2	  The value of this camera is its size and convenience . It does not take great photos , but for the most part , outdoor pix are not too bad . I compared exact shots from my olympus 2 and 3 megapixel , and the colors from the casio were a little washed out - not true to color . Indoor shots with low light are bad , as the flash is so small it does not produce very good photos . These are the drawbacks . I got this camera to have when I don't want to carry my larger camera and to take places that I would not otherwise have taken the other . It is cool and will draw a crowd . You will need to get an additional SD card if you want to take any number of pix , but they are cheap now . Final note , the usb / charging cradle that came with it is very nice and works well - I did not install any of their software as Win XP immediatley picked up and installed the driver .  
2	  I was able to find a smart card for an older camera . Wasn't sure it was possible thank goodness I found it and it works well .  
1	  It will never work with Win2k . This sucker is going to have the sledge hammer treatment . Worthwhile purchase if you like to bash things with hammers .  
1	  My daughter received this camera as a gift . Koday Easyshare was supposed to be so great , but I don't agree . I am not a novice at taking pictures and have taken many great pictures with my Canon Powershot . The Kodak camera eats up batteries like mad . There is a delay between pressing the button and when the camera actually snaps the picture , which has resulted in many missed shots . It is very sensitive to motion and pictures come out blurry . On top of that the software that you use to download pictures ( and you need the software to download , unlike the Canon ) is a memory hog and bogs down my computer ( 2 different versions installed on two computers ) . Other than the camera being lightweight , I don't have anything good to say about it . I realize this is an older model now ( not when we received it ) , but it 's only two years old and I 'm ready to pitch it because it is so frustrating to use .  
2	  If this thing connected easily with my simulator aircraft every time , it would get five stars . But I doubt this is a problem with the ButtKicker itself . The workmanship is excellent . I had it set up in no time using zero tools . The electronics are well designed from a user-standpoint . I 'm happy with the purchase and would definitely buy it again and recommend it . BUT .. there are frustrations . The problem doesn't exist with the default FSX aircraft . However , I mostly fly addon aircraft such as the PA46T Jet Prop from Carenado and the Citation Mustang from Flight1 . For these aircraft raising the landing gear ALWAYS works fine .. but it 's vibration from the engines which doesn't always happen . I find myself tweaking the ButtKicker controls trying to find the right amount of vibration . But when I do , it 's glorious . I don't want to fly without the ButtKicker Gamer 2 . What I have found works best is to make sure everything is on and working with my flight sim . I 'm in the aircraft I want to fly sitting on the runway before I start my mission . I hit the key to reveal the FSX menu bar at the top . I go into the settings for sound and I basically change the setting from default sound device to my internal sound card . It it 's already selected I change back to the default device exit , go back in and select my sound card again . This seems to work reliably . It 's a hassle but works . ALSO NOTE : I had to go into my sound card settings and make sure that I was maximizing low frequencies to the surround sound channel that my ButtKicker is hooked up to . If you aren't using surround , you may still want to play with the sound settings of your computer to see if it doesn't improve your FSX and ButtKicker experience . TrackIR 5 + AccuFeel + 3 monitors + addon aircraft + Saitek yoke / throttle / pedals / other controls + ButtKicker make for a fantastic simulator experience .  
2	  I bought a pair of these several years ago on sale and use them as my front and rear center channel speakers for a 6.1 surround sound system . they work great .  
1	  I received this tripod as a birthday present . I set it up and used it to take one family photo . My daughter then walked by , slightly bumping one leg of the tripod . I was quite surprised to look at the tripod and find the leg badly bent . Tried to straighten the leg and it snapped right off . " Sturdy steel leg construction " the package says . HA ! Straight into the garbage it went after being out of it 's package less than 10 minutes . I 'll get a different brand next time .  
2	  I upgraded from an old AGP GF6800GTS . I know that the GTX version of this card is supposed to be awsome as well , but let me tell you that I cranked up everything on WOW and nary a stutter or slowdown . For the price , this is a fantastic card that plays everything I have at max settings flawlessly . I purchased the EVGA 680I board as well so if I need a new card I can always buy another and use SLI.I recommend this card to save a few bucks over the GTX and still get steller performance .  
1	  For the price , the keyboard has a nice feel . Unfortunately , the left SHIFT key had a tendency to stick very frequently . Unsticking required pressing the key with significant effort multiple times . I returned it to Amazon for a refund .  
1	  The editorial review failed to mention that this camera is terrible . The quality is poor , the interface is poor , and the feature set is lacking . The Veo Observer offers much better performance and value at a lower cost , and adds pan , tilt , and zoom . There is no competition here . I made the mistake of thinking this thing was a PTZ camera . Even if it was , I would have still returned it - it is that bad - even at $ 200 . One good note - the setup was painless . Too bad 1 star is the lowest rating possible .  
2	  This cable was exactly what I was looking for - at a way better price than @ Verizon Wireless or other sites .  
1	  This cable works to hardwire your GPS , but for my application ( BMW R1200RT ) the cables were too short and therefore useless .  
2	  Just wanted to assure interested macbook owners that this product does in fact work with a macbook pro 13 " ( 2009 unibody model ) at least in my case . I didn't experience any denting or breakage like a few previous reviewers have complained about . Another reviewer got it right , the trick is to get the t-lock and the other two poles to line up ( by twisting the key from the unlock position rightwards ) , insert it , and turn the key again . Voila , very easy , just don't pull on it too hard or you might get some scratches . If a thief however pulls on it hard enough , I 'm not sure how much force the mac body can withstand . I have not been using the product very long , but it seems to be very decent for the price . The cord is just the right stiffness and thick enough to withstand small wire cutters I believe . Now larger wire cutters are a different story , there is no defense against those , but I don't think anybody runs around with industrial size cutters in libraries or wherever you might be using this . I am a bit worried about this anti-tampering locking mechanism though . I don't know what constitutes tampering , and am afraid to mess with it . But I think it should be okay as long as you don't go at it with a lock-pick ( something a thief might actually try using ) .  
2	  The Shipping was fast , and it WILL ship with FedEx NOT USPS . The battery life on this battery is about 5 hours , and now I 'm finally wireless again ! It doesn't quite mach the color for my iBook , But who who cares , as long as it gets the job done thats all that counts ! It doesn't really fit that well but it works as it should .  
2	  I shopped a long time before settling on the Sharp XL-55 . This unit is very simple to use , sounds better than most systems costing several times the price , and is smaller than most . The added benefit of the cassette deck for us old-timers is a big plus . The included speakers sound pretty good , but I 'm gonna upgrade mine to a set of Bose . Reception is pretty good , not great . Pros : Simplicity of a single CD playerCassette deck w / logic controlsActual bass / treble controls , not preset EQ ! Small enough to actually sit on a 12 " shelfSimple , logical remote controlRotary volume control , not push-buttonCons : Cassette deck 's " Pause " button disabled in some modesNo " Scan " on the tuner , so switching to non-presetstations is tedious . External antenna connection doesn't accept rooftopantenna wireAt $ 200 , this would be a 4-star system , but for under $ 100 , WOW ! I am thoroughly pleased .  
1	  This battery is not for canon powershot s100 as they say in the description of the product ! Now I will have to return it  
2	  Pretty good service from Amazon . Shipping was fast as lightning ! Product is awesome ! Actually using it for a samsung D600 cell phone and it works wonderful !  
2	  Okay . 1st , it 's less than 2 bucks . 2nd , it has free shipping . 3rd , it arrived A LOT earlier than I expected it to ( it was supposed to arrive between February 9 and February 29 , but I got it on Friday , January 27 ! ) . 4th , it does exactly what I needed it to do . As the description says , you can't get any better than this ! Very good buy , I have nothing bad to say about this .  
2	  For a system this small , the sound is absolutely amazing ! I bought this purely for the ipod speaker . Everything else such as the clock , alarm and radio are merely small pluses so I couldn't care less about their flaws . I also have the Altec Lansing inMotion im600 portable ipod speaker which I got from a friend for Christmas . It got stellar reviews and justly so for it 's compactness and easy portability . But sound-wise it 's got nothing on this Teac unit . I say it 's not even half as good . So if you 're looking for a clock , alarm clock or radio look elsewhere . This product has many shortcomings in those areas according to my fellow reviewers . But if you want a small ipod speaker with stunning sound quality and not much else look no further than the Teac SR-LXi-B .  
2	  This pen is a great update for my old Graphire3 tablet . The desing its completly improved . Totally compatible . New software , great over all . If you don't have the money to buy a new tablet , this is an alternative for you .  
1	  A true " Coaster Maker " . I bought this unit to have a simple stand alone solution to make DVD 's from Analog sources . Used media from Sony , Maxcell , Verbatim and Fuji - got one useable DVD on a Fuji Double level ( $ 7 each ) . Called Sony 3x they say it is my VCR 's . I hooked up the VC20 drive to my computer and downloaded the firmware update ( Ver . 4 ) Still nothing but coasters called Sony and they again said it was my VCR ( Sony , Panasonic , Apex ) I then tried a different tact - I left the Sony VC20 hooked up to my computer and used WIN-DVD Creator 2 to burn the disk and guess what - ALL the disks Sony , Maxcell , Verbatim and Fuji all play on ALL of 3 of my VCR 's ! I do not think that the CODEC / Firmware in the Sony when operating in the " Stand alone mode " can correctly format & correctly finalize a DVD disk in an Industry standard format . Sony - get your act together !  
1	  I purchased a RipFlash Plus 256 MP3 player / recorder in June 2004 to record voice interviews . Major flaws in its construction and in its download software mean you are very likely to lose your recordings . To make matters worse , customer support is very resistant to issuing refunds for faulty equipment . - It produces decent sound quality , though the recordings have a constant low-level hum in the background . Two main problems with the unit make it very problematic for capturing recordings : 1 ) The software provided ( and required ) to download the sound files to computer over USB is very flakey - sometimes it works , sometimes does not connect , sometimes downloads only part of the sound file but indicates it is " done . " This happens on both of the newer Dell computers that I 've tried it on . By contrast , all other devices I attach to the USB ports on these same computers exchange files flawlessly . 2 ) The RipFlash Plus is able to hold a SmartMedia card and record to it . This would seem to be an alternative to downloading through the USB connection - just remove the SmartMedia card , insert it into your computers card reader , and copy off the files . BUT . . . the ejector button on the RipFlash broke the second time I ejected a card , and appears likely to break on any unit . The ejector button pushes the card out with two very tiny brittle plastic tabs . It takes almost nothing to break one ( in my case , just ejecting the card did it . ) Then , you can't get the card out , or if you do fish it out , you can no longer position it in correctly without the button in place . Regarding customer support . . . when the unit arrived in the mail , I discovered that they had thrown in a " voice activated TV remote " - at no charge , and without any advance notice - a device they don't sell on their site . I can't imagine anything more useless than that so I tossed it immediately . After obtaining an RMA from them and returning the broken RipFlash , they at first tried to charge me a " restocking " fee for the useless recorder . After I put my credit card company on their case , they finally refunded the full amount . Then , they decided they needed to charge me $ 40 for the throw-away remote that they had sent unsolicited , so they made a new charge on my card for it . You might want to consider the options before you decide to try the RipFlash Plus . Rob  
2	  Was in need of some CDs so I could clean all my music off my computer . These will hold almost two entire CDs on them , and they do not seem to scatch as easily as some of the other blank CD-R CDs that I 've bought in the past . Will have to get more so I am stocked up in the future !  
1	  Initially , I was impressed with sound for such inexpensive speakers . But , after only a few months the subwoofer and front LED light both stopped working . They sound terrible without a subwoofer - like fingernails scratching a chalkboard . Now I 'll have to spend more money to get something reliable . Don't get suckered by this speakers , they are no more than a trinket .  
1	  The subject summarizes it . We 'll be grooving to a song , when all of a sudden the music stops for 2 to 10 seconds . It 's very random - it can go 5 straight hours without pausing and then do it on 3 songs in a row . Replay the songs that it skips on , and it works fine . Hundreds of owners of this same model have this problem ( do a Google search ) and Apple hasn't solved any . They say all hard drive-based MP3 players do it . Well , I 've had a hard drive-based Creative for 3 years and a 120 gb Zune for the past 6 months and they NEVER paused in the middle of a song .  
2	  It was the easiest hook-up I ever have done for a home or small business network / router  
2	  Needed this since mine broke . The price was great and the shipping was very fast . Would buy from this store again !  
2	  HP 02 Black Printer Cartridge ( C8721WN ) . This is a GREAT product , and it costs much less than the HP original cartridges . I had doubts about it 's quality , because it was a compatible vs . original HP product . It works fine , and I recommend these cartridges to anyone trying to save just a bit of money on inkjet cartridges .  
2	  Excellent order response from Amazon / Adorama . Great price and more in line based upon the quality of the lens by Canon . It is a hobbyist lens and not a pro lens thus the focus is a bit slow on it ( using 400D slr , the 55-250 seems to be just a bit more responsive on focus adjustment . Not a bad lens and sure beats the manual 70-300 non IS lens .  
1	  Bought this card and was able to get 60 pictures before it died . What a lousy product . Never again will I buy this or any other Viking product .  
1	  This is singularly the worst iPod player I 've ever encountered . I purchased it for use at work , and it 's given me nothing but headaches . The main problems center around the remote , which to say is unresponsive would be putting it mildly . Most buttons have to be hit at least twice to do what you want , and it 's not unusual for a button to do the exact opposite of its intended purpose . Then , every few songs or so , when you 're skipping ahead or back , it makes this BRR ! sound followed by a high-pitched whine , and takes several seconds before proceeding to the next song . I 'm extremely sorry I purchased this device , and I would strongly advise others from making the same mistake .  
1	  I was so excited to get a great deal from Amazon on what I 'd heard was a quality burner . As soon as I 'd taken my new burner out of the box , however , I immediately started to have problems . First my mac wouldn't recogize the device in OS9 ( the platform for the burner software ) .. ) I finally got my mac to find the burner after I rebooted it in 9 only , but thenthe software wouldn't allow me to drag more than one track into the recording que at a time .. Although this may be a great drive , I really have no way of knowing because I haven't been able to burn cds yet . If you 're a mac user , pick a different product .  
1	  This power cord was shipped on May 4 , 2012 and died on July 14 , 2012 . That is a short life for the price they charged . This is the 3rd power cord purchased for my Toshiba Satellite laptop . May change brands when I shop for a new laptop .  
2	  I have this in white . I find it get dirty easily and the shell is not very easy to wipe off . So if you get white which is clean and crip , expect to use some sort of cleaner on it and of course be careful . After only a week , the threads on the shoulder pad are hanging off , they will need a trim soon which makes me wonder how long it will last . The zipper stetches when I zip it closed , it seems like it may pop one day soon . As much as I like the bag , I avoid using it as I don't want it to fall apart . So I have to chose when to use it . It 's stylish and slim ( profile ) but I just with it had a shiny shell so it would be easy to wipe off , more realiztic leater on the shoulder strap . Better Zipper .. like Luggage quailty zipper that didn't stretch . I gave it a good rating for the style .. which as we all know is ALMOST all that matters anyway .  
1	  This is a truly terrible product .. and is the last that I will buy from Targus : I bought the Targus 70W AC / Auto / Air adapter for my Toshiba laptop . Even without plugging the adapter into any device , it powers down just a few seconds after being plugged into the wall . When I can get it to stay powered up for more than 30s , and plug it into my laptop it will randomly cut out . Assuming that I had bought a device that delivers too little power , I then bought the 90W equivalent . Guess what ? Same problem ! I always thought highly of Targus but after seeing how awful these products are , I 'll be steering clear of their future products .  
1	  i have a garmin quest fitted to my bike but recently had the chance to use a tomtom rider for a few days . they do not compare . considering the rider is twice the price , it is no more glove friendly than the quest , and the bluetooth feature is a complete pain . why no simple headphone socket ? the directions were difficult to hear on the motorway , full volume is only about a quarter that of the garmin . with helmet speakers ( of your choice ) the quest gives simple to hear directions , in stereo . the quest comes with full european mapping , for no extra . i will not be rushing to buy one and do not reccommend it as particularly " motorcycle friendly " , obviously no bikers were involved in the development !  
1	  This unit is junk . The CD player quit working after the second day . It 's especially bad since this was a Christmas present . This is my second Sony product to have a malfunctioning CD player . What happened to Sony 's quality ?  
1	  The ads is misleading , it can not match the need for a photographer with long lens . Look at the demo image in product description , What I can tell you is these two lens are all medium length . long lens + body > height of bottom apartment plus 4 inch . So you can not put the lens-attached SLR vertically like the demo image shows . long lens + body = width of bottom apartment . example : a 70-300mm lens attached to SLR camera , i have to either put it in top apartment ( which is assumed to hold jackets , lunch and other stuffs according to ads ) , or i have to remove all " wall " s from the bottom apartment to lay down the camera and leaving " un-walled " little space for two medium-size lens .  
2	  I have been looking for a digital camera for a long time now and was about to buy the Olympus D-490 , but luckly I found out about this newer model . There are three reasons why I went with this camera instead of the older model . This model features a Quicktime video mode that allows you to capture up to 66 seconds of footage on the provided 8mb card . This I thought would be a great way to send short movies to family and friend or just if something big was hapening and I wanted to make sure that I caught it . I also liked the easy USB conection opposed to the serial cable on the previous model . USB is alot faster , so most people end up buying a seprate USB card reader , which costs extra . With this camera this can be avoided . The third and final reason that I went with this camera is the improved zoom range . The D-510 has a 3x opical zoom and a 6x digital zoom . This allows for a longer shooting range .  
2	  nothing better than it but the W100 .. becouse its smallerThan the 300 , i can Load the 100 some how with : EOS 20D , EF-S 17-85 , EF 50 1.8 , EF100 2.8 or EF 70-300 + Flash EX580 & accessories are : Canon View Finder , 2 of 511BP batteries 8 AA 's Flashe of shoe cord , remot wire , rocket blower , 3 CF memo cards with 1 adapter , 2 PC 's of LensPen & still few small spaces for tiny things ; 0 ) perfect product So useful looks smart and cool designe  
2	  I bought this item after returning the Panasonic RX-D29 CD / Radio / Cassette Boombox with MP3 CD Playback ( see my review ) . This box IS different in that it doesn't have MP3 playback . Other than that missing feature , this Sony is a far superior machine . The sound , especially with both the Mega Xpand and the Mega Bass turned on , is wonderful . The physical design is lovely . The buttons ( on the box and on the remote ) are much more user-friendly and intuitive than on the Panasonic . Also much larger . So far , I only have one small complaint ( my only reason for not giving a rating of 5 stars ) : the rather tiny display doesn't have a back-light . It is positioned in the middle of the front , rather than higher up , so if you have the box placed on a table , you have to kneel down and get pretty close to read the display . The ring of pretty , neon-blue lighting behind the display actually makes it harder to see the display because the display appears darker in contrast . This is unfortunate because the display provides much useful information , and I 'd like to be able to see it better . In summary , this box has one design flaw and many wonderful audio and cosmetic features . An extremely good value .  
2	  The Zumo 550 is AWESOME . On the bike it is very easy to operate , even with gloves on . Programming is a cinch , either on the computer and then download , or right on the GPS unit itself . I highly recommend this unit for any biker out there needing directions ! I wired it direct to the bike , and the handlebar mount works very easily , and has the safety feature built in so no one can steal it . Plus , even if it 's stolen , the thief can't use it ! What a feature loaded unit ! The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating is I wish it was a little bigger , and had voice directions , without having to plug it into a bluetooth device , as some people don't have communication devices on their motorcycles ( like me ) . Otherwise , awesome product .  
1	  These are extremely overpriced earbus . I have had 2 sets , on replaced under warranty and they both broke . I am really carefull abou them the sound is just so-so . Better bass that most but Female Vocals and piano sounds are just terrible - they can just a lot of boom boom and completely-un-HiFi tunes . They both broke at the jack , and there is a lot of cable rustling - there are others that are a lot better . I have had Bose Tri-ports , for Jazz Classical and Vocals - excellent . These are just Volume brain blasters . If you want your brain fried , these are it . But it won't hold up for long .  
2	  I 've been happy with every B & W filter I 've purchased , and this one is no exception . It appears to be another high quality filter that is easy to keep clean . For screw-in filters , B & W is always my favorite , though they can be a bit pricey .  
2	  There isn't a whole lot of surprises when you buy something like this , it basically comes down to & # 34 ; it either works or it doesn't . & # 34 ; I got this cable to jerry-rig my laptop to my stereo and it gets the job done exactly as planned . ( I also have another pair in my car so I can listen to the music on my phone using my car stereo ! )  
1	  The audio is horrible and I have returned this product . The manufacturer has informed me that I received a defective product . The customer service is horrible as well . They bounce you around from number to number .  
1	  The thing is I like the display and everything , but the first monitor when I got had a bad pixel in the middle . So I understand it happens , return it and got another one same model . Two days later the same thing happen , and two more days I got one more bad pixel . So I am returning this one as well , but no exchange this time . Just not worth it . Plus you can not adjust it , it stays only in one position . It may not happen anything with this bad pixels , but I don't want to take a chance . It 's a hassle .  
2	  My son lives in a dorm room in Boston with no access to cable . He has a small 15 inch HDTV ( Element - Circuit City Brand ) . He had what we thought was a good antenna also purchased at Circuit City for twice the price of this antenna . He barely picked up any channels . He purchased this antenna and now picks up every HD channel available in Boston plus many other channels he could not get before . The HDTV channels are clearer than my channels through cable . Never thought an antenna would make such a big difference .  
2	  I wasn't sure that the mouse being so small that I would like it but it fits my hand just great and works like a gem . I like when you only have to plug it into the back of your laptop and it works .. !  
2	  I own 2 of the Nikon EN-EL1 batteries and have taken a total of over 6,000 photos with my Nikon 4300 in the past 3 years . About half of the photos are with flash . For my typical use , I get about 50 photos per battery . For vacation photos , I am using one battery , while charging the other . After about 3,000 photos / battery and 3 years , I have not noticed any degradation in the battery life . Good value for the money .  
2	  This is a great price for a 6-foot Null Modem Serial cable ! I really needed this when serialing into another machine , and it really comes in handy ! Many high end rackable switches also need these to console in and administer them directly ! If you are in need of one , this is the one to get !  
1	  While i hear all teh best about this camera my very first impression is that upon opening its its already missing Parts Mainly the stereo headset . if i cmpany cant get it correct at the plant than im not interested it .  
1	  Like many recent reviewers , the unit worked okay but failed within a couple of years . We used the item in our home theater ( for both cable and antenna sourced material ) , so usage was infrequent ( 5 hrs a week ) . There were always issues with startup and shut down . Finally , the unit refused to power on . I 'm used to components giving years of daily usage , so I consider this to be an unacceptable product . I won't be risking my dollars on Samsung products again .  
1	  I purchased this car power splitting device and it works , just not very well . It does not come with a fuse , so if there is a power overload ( and yes , I had one ) , then this product will start to melt until it blows out the fuse in your car . So spend a little extra money and pick up a splitter with a fuse in it .  
2	  Sony MDR-XD200 Stereo HeadphonesI listen to music all day long at work . I really like the 10 foot cord . The sound is crisp and clear . I can really crank the volume up and the other people around me cannot hear what I am listening too at the volume that I am listening to . They are big and bulky no doubt but I will take that for the clarity of sound that I get . The Treble and Bass frequences come across clear . I have not noticed a differences in the Sound / Movie feature . I get all the Highs and Lows . The Sound Quality is almost as good as the Custom Bulit Bose system in my Truck . I have also used these Sony MDR-XD200 Headphones for Gaming and the quality of sound does not change at all . They are well made and sturdy . Some people complain about it hurts after a few hours , my opinion of what they say is ; I weared my Sony MDR-XD200 Headphones for approx 11 hours a day by 5 days a week . , I have not problem with the comfort and they do not hurt . Kudos to Sony for the Sony MDR-XD200 Stereo Headphones . I love them .  
1	  I bought this Celestron T-ring to adapt a Televue Pronto to a Canon 40D . It does work but the fit is very loose and sloppy . It does not make me convinced that the camera is securely supported or that it holds the camera with any precision ( optically speaking ) to the scope . One other problem , at shutter speeds of 1/4000 or faster and using the live-view mode of the 40D , there is an under-exposed strip on the bottom of each exposure . Because I haven't tried the Canon T-ring I can't say whether this flaw is unique to the Celestron but I would recommend spending a few more bucks for the Canon T-ring for the better fit I would assume it has .  
1	  Hello , this is my first Amazon review , actually my first anywhere review . I normally depend on reading reviews but was never so affected by a product , positive or negative , that I felt a need to write a review . My experience with Audiovox 's D1750T DVD player has changed that . I 'll put it as plainly as this : If you buy this product , it WILL break . That is a fact . That says it all , and the rest may get long winded , but read on if you want to know how / why it will break . I purchased this product 6 months ago . After 2 months the hinge on the battery that allows you to set the unit on a tabletop and watch hands-free broke . I thought it was a fluke but was able to get a replacement . Now my second battery has broken in the exact same place , the exact same way , and that 's after the fact that I did my best to handle the unit with the utmost care , since I thought it might have been my fault the first time . It is now clear to me that this is a manufacturing error , one in fact that Audiovox 's Customer Service representative acknowledged yet refused to do anything about since I was outside the 90 days warranty . Unfortunately I 've only found one other person online who 's written about it ( epinions . com ) but that 's out of maybe 6 total reviews I 've found anywhere online . The player gets 2 stars from me because battery issues aside , it 's a decent player at a decent price . The resolution and sound without headphones leave something to be desired , but if you can pick it up for $ 200 or less it would be a good player as far as screen size and general quality goes . But this battery issue and subsequent customer service issue is unacceptable . People need to be warned when they 're buying something that is flawed in its manufacturing and will break . Another warning is that the paint ( ? ) or whatever it is that makes the sides of the unit black has started to flake so now the unit 's good looking design is marred .. insult to injury I tell ya ! Bottom line , I say don't buy it , but if you 'll be using it in such a way that you won't use the battery 's stand ( btw , there 's a stand that flips off the back if you 're using the unit with external power . I 've never had a use for it . ) , then I guess it 's a decent player . I 'll bet there 's better ones out there for the money though . P.S. I finally managed to strongarm a higher-up at Audiovox into replacing the battery for free .. this time . Fingers crossed THIS one doesn't break too ..  
1	  Keep getting confusing messages with U3 that tell me I may have errors when saving a file , but am not told what to do . I have the SanDisk Cruzer mini , but do not have any problems with that product . Am beginning to have doubts about some SanDisk products .  
2	  This is my final GPS unit . It does what I want . It 's easy to set and tracks quickly and efficiently . Sure wish these things could see the satellites inside of buildings . I got it partly to find my car in mall parking lots , but it would also be handy to track back to the correct building entrance . Once it 's moving around under roof , though , it can't track well , if at all . I 'd like it to have a lanyard hole , so I wouldn't always have to wear it on my wrist . I could use it as a key fob or have other options . The computer interface cable has to be plugged in HARD to get it to connect . The Iogear USB to serial adapter cable works well with it .  
2	  We needed over 40 disposable cameras for wedding purposes . I was happy to find these online , so I didn't have to purchase them in bulk at the store . Arrived in great condition . Prior to this , I hadn't purchased a disposable camera in a while , so I would say the resulting picture quality was good . All the flashes worked , I think .  
2	  When I first got this lens , all I could say was " Wow " . It was much bigger than any of my other lenses I own , weighing a hefty amount . I didn't know what to think . It was in testing it out that I got to see how excellent the optics are . Here 's how I 'll simply put it : If the Olympus 50mm f2 macro prime lens is considered a crown jewel in the Olympus optics lineup , then this lens is like having a prime for every mm in focal length is covers . I say this not necessarily for the macro function , but for the portraits . This is definitely The King of portrait lenses in Olympus 's catalog . The only cons are the price & the weight . If you are a portrait shooter and you can handle the weight , and your wallet can handle the hit it will receive , this is definitely THE lens to have . You will definitely not regret it ! samples of work taken with this lens can be viewed @ [ .. ]  
1	  Product works great when it 's not broken . Have gone through two in the last two years . First one had an electronic issue . The second broke in half . Product needs to be improved before I buy another one .  
1	  The trend here is pretty clear . The card is great , until it fails . Ours failed less than a year after we got it ( about 10 months , actually ) taking a day 's worth of photos with it . Up until then , write speed was good , and I considered it a good card . Sounds like a fairly common defect - I will avoid this manufacturer 's cards in the future .  
2	  Easy to put together , viewing the stars in no-time ! The view finder is weak so don't expect too much with that but it can be upgraded relatively inexpensively .  
2	  this is one of the best sony product that i used . i use it for psp , camera , and as usb drive . it 's tiny shape always fill my memcard reader easily . the bad thing is that the card charger sometimes is not really good . that 's it  
2	  Wonderful product ! I didn't believe in such a thing . but honestly , after couple of days using it . I have experienced a huge difference in my laptop performance ! I own a DV9000 Hp laptop ! overheating was one of the problems that I was complaining about ! but now , after using Zalman cooler pad , i am very happy with my laptop performance ! I use my laptop for designing 3D graphics , Zelman help cooling my PC effectively ! its very quit , nice , and uses USB port so no battery or charging needed ! trust me , you will not regret baying this product ! i strongly recommend using it !  
2	  I purchased this scanner to scan thousands of film strips and slides from an old family archive . So far I have only scanned 300 + 35 mm b & w negative film strips . At the 4800 resolution , it takes about 1 hour to scan 2 strips of 6 pictures each . While it is going to take me quite some time to get through all of the pictues , I have been very impressed by the scanner . It generally autodetects the strips very well , though there are some tricks I 've picked up for partial strips or strips with " missing " pictures ( basically place the strip as far from the hinge side of the mounting bracket as possible , paper filler typically not needed ) . One thing that surpised me is that my home theater cannot play such high resolution pictures . I have resorted to using ImageMagick to convert the pictures to lower resolution to be able to display on the system ( knowing DOS commands helps here ! ) .  
1	  I contacted the seller but have not heard back yet . The ipod was supposed to be shipped a month ago but I still haven't received it . I 'm not sure what to do . Please help . Thanks , Greg  
2	  I was considering buying a Canon printer , but felt the Brother was a more realistically simple machine for family use . It works a lot easier in comparison to the Canon . I particularly like the ease of ink cartridge replacement , and now will be using the $ 14.99 set of 2 ea color that Amazon offers . The Black is actually superior to the OEM cartridge that Brother makes . At $ 2 ea . I don't have an issue with ink usuage , and frankly though we do a lot of printing , the ink usuage is much more positive for us compared to our HP multi purpose machine . I also prefer the individual ink tanks . The flatbed copy / scanner design is really an improvement too . A neat idea is to use the LAN connection instead of the USB . You can run a LAN wire into the 640CW instead of USB . This is referred to as a CAT 5 cord . It 's the same cord that connects your computer to your modem or router . Connect this wire to your wireless router . I have a Linksys with 4 ports . Run your installation CD and select Wired LAN option , and the printer then recognizes the wireless router . You can connect the wireless router to multiple printers through LAN connections , format all computers that you connect to the wireless Router with your installation disk , and you can print from multiple computers . You can also make the printer totally wireless , and print off your notebooks all over your house or office . Note that this applies to XP-cannot guarantee it will work with Vista . Note : Vista will require downloading a firmware installation from the Brother Website .  
1	  I ordered 3 cables and one was defective . It wasn't obvious and took me a little while to figure out as the problem was intermittent . I didn't bother to send it back or get a replacement since it was so cheap in the first place .  
1	  Got this printer for a home office and from the minute it was out of the box , it refused to feed paper . I 've tried cleaning the rollers , clearing any obstructions in the paper path , using different paper . Nothing gets this POS to feed a sheet automatically . Currently , I load one sheet at a time , gently pushing the page into the rollers until it grabs which of course means the printout is crooked most of the time . Their support lines are a joke staffed with cheap offshore labor that runs you through the script they 've been given then can offer no help if that doesn't work . For a laugh , try calling the line a second time and explaining that you 've already ' cleaned the rollers , reseated the cartridge and bought special inkjet paper ' . The CSR will patiently wait till you 're done then start at the top of the support script once again ! This thing also hemorrhages ink like a gunshot victim . I actually looked under the printer to see if there was a puddle from a leak it burned through the cartridge so quickly . This is especially frustrating as the print quality is dubious at best - it looks like it was lightly sketched with a # 2 pencil . This printer is well priced but believe me , you 'll more than make up the ' savings ' on the base price buying cartridges . All in all , if you 're looking to print , scan or fax one or maybe two pages at a time you can probably muddle through with this thing but if you plan to use it for more than infrequently you 'll be very disappointed .  
1	  + ' s : small , looks cool , good sound quality - 's : i am running win 98 , pII 400 , 256 ram .. the software ( audio manager ) which is the only way to transfer music is very buggy , slow , and eats up to many resources ( feels like written in JAVA awt ) . 25 % success rate transferring songs over 6 megs . if i turn off the player in the middle of playing a song , the player will not play that song anymore .. ie : it will start playing and then 30 sec in it will jump automatically to next track . - go buy an mp3 cdplayer like pine technology 's  
1	  This kit does the job but , I wish I used heavy ganged wire . If you are running a lot of watts , this system shuts down my system too much and was needed to be replaced with a better kit . Don't waist your money , buy the better kit the first time you will be glade you did later .  
2	  You can always trust amazon . com for your order and at very good price ; I ordered these speakers and got them like in less than a week . I connected 12 gauge speaker wire to these . These babies are priced higher just about anywhere on the internet . These rear speakers I have the crossover frequency set @ 60HZ . And , these are just some of the things I was looking for in my rear speakers , sensitivity 90 dB , handles up to 150 watts , 1 " CMMD tweeter , 6-1/2 " CMMD woofer , 5-way binding posts , bass-reflex ( ported ) enclosure . They look really cool in black with the grill off , " not that cheesy country cherry look " . Alright this is it right here ; when you look at INFINITY speakers with the grill off and take a real good look at their woofers and then you look at a JBL or a POLK you can actually see the difference in the making of a higher quality woofer . It does not look cheap ! Some people say their overrated not ah , look and compare ! you better hurry up & get'em cause their not in production anymore . I 've got them paired with Beta 50 's , cc360 , and SW12 with a DENON receiver to boot ! SHEAR POWER dudes ! I would be curious to know what the reviewer from NJ who said that these speakers are poor .. who 's had them for 4 years .. i want to know what is he using for an AVR , what type of AVR is important how much power are you able to push thru each channel , NOT SHARED , but each channel independently driven .. watts ? weight ? THD % ? the heavier the AVR the bigger the amps , the bigger the amps the more power goes to ur speaker , reason why the need for thicker speaker cable is important and what speaker wire are you using .. im runing a 6.1 , of the three BETA20 's in the rear one has a Monster cable speaker wire and that one is the loudest and are you able to adjust your frequency cross overs on your AVR .. adjust your decibels .. can you adjust distance .. does your AVR hav MultEQxt system from Audyssey . This last item will do it all for you including the timing , automatically ! but u can still do adjustments .. and keep the timing . THD % the lower the # the more quality audio u will hav . PLEASE dont hav a 20lb . AVR and expect good sound out ur high quality speakers or visa-versa . GOOD LUCK !  
2	  After reading all the good reviews I decided to purchase 2 of these . I ordered them before I bought my tv and new entertainment center . Uopon getting my samsung 50 " plasma I read the manual and it said use only hdmi 1.3 cables as substandard cables could cause screen freeze or flickering . It kinda had me worried as it does not say they are 1.3 , but once I finally got everything hooked up they proved to be a huge bargain . These are great cables , 1 is hooked to my digital cable box and the other to our ps3 . Everything is perfect , blue ray movies are astonishing ! Do yourself a huge favor and get these before getting sucked in to paying 100 bucks a piece to get fancy looking name brand stuff ! These cables will perfom just as well . Gold plated connections are not needed , as a matter of fact gold is not even a great conductor , it makes good connections as it does not oxidize , that is all it does .  
1	  I purchased 2 of these units for backup and archival purposes . However , within a few weeks both were so noisy that I had to turn them off . While I like the idea of a fan to keep the drive cool , I trashed both of them and decided on an aluminum enclosure . You can purchase a much higher quality drive enclosure for much less . The plastic is cheap and flimsy , the fan is extremely loud , and the overall quality screams cheap .  
2	  I got my 30gig Zune as an X-mas gift and took it for a test run today . It 's a really awesome mp3 player so far , nice storage for the price paid for it , easy setup and software updating . I even thought that the packaging was pretty neat . Synced right up to the music on my computer and ripped a cd with no flub . Not a very detailed review but I 'm happy with this product .  
2	  I bought this months ago for $ 12.99 ! Included the Sennheiser earbuds . MP3 Music quality is great through those , or connected to quality PC speaker system ( with subwoofwer ) . FM radio quality was fair ( no real antenna ) , and recording Mic or from radio was weak . But I bought it for the MP3 - and LOW price . Of course , the screen is too small for middle aged people such as myself to read without glasses , and the 700 mAh Ni-Cd battery I use barely powers it for 8 hours .. but what do you expect for $ 13 . If I had paid more , I would expect a larger display , and the ability to both play and recharge a rechargeable battery when plugged into PC or other USB power source ( AC wall adapter or Auto adapter ) . ALSO , I expect newer units will accept SD MICRO cards , so they won't stick out from the case . Overall , I would buy again ( for same price ) , or for a gift for someone .  
1	  This is a fake product .. It 's not original Sony .. if u call n ask Sony they will tel you its fake .. check it on Sony website .. it 's fake .. mine 's not even chargin the batteries ! .. i pee on this item and this seller  
1	  I want a multi-purpose faster ( with some zoom ) lens for my Canon XS to replace KIT lens and do not want to spend a fortune . I want faster lens as I want to capture my little ones actions without using flash , and kit lens is no good for that . I know 50mm prime is great , but on APS-C it is equivalent to 80mm , and not usable indoor because of close quarters many times . I want atleast 35mm to start with . Though not veryfast , Lenses those match my requirement are Tamron 17-50 f2.8 and Sigma 18-50 f2.8 within my price range . Good , I got the lens from local retailer so that I can exchange if required , though I have to drive almost 50miles roundtrip to the store . It felt good in hand , much heavier than KIT lense , built is good . Hmm , pretty much all the photos are out of focus , some are okay . None of those are correctly in focus and I was comparing to Canon Kit lens with IS . Kit lens was much sharper . And another kicker , it was struggling to focus in low-light where KIT lens has absolutely no problem focussing in all Zoom ranges . Anyways since it is a bad copy , I drove again , spend almost 3 hour for getting a replacement . I was really hoping I would get a good copy . Oh , boy , again same BS . All photos soft . Then I started experiment with manual focus , and picture are tack sharp , and ofcourse as I expected the photos taken by Tamron are better than KIT lens , and I could use faster shutter speed . Manual focus ring is not good , I have rotate it very slowly / precisely to adjust focus . In further testing , I used liveview ( QuickView Mode ) focussed with auto-focus ( I was using ZoomView on XS LCD ) , then slide it manual mode , then adjusted focus ( slightly turn focus ring to clockwise ) ( Front focus issue ) . Now , it is tack sharp . For the kit lens , there is absolutely no issue . I took several photo where I have lot of fine text on Box in very good lighting with Auto and Manual mode , Auto Mode always Front Focussed . And to their credit it seem this second copy was not struggling to Focus that much in low-light ( still not as good as KIT lens ) . But two copies later , 100 miles drive , 20 + hours of time spend over a week , I end up with nothing . Now , I need to drive back to return it , another 50 miles . In my opinion this ridiculous . Quality control at Tamron seems to be worst than one those cheap chainese toys . One would expect out of two brand new lenses atleast one would be good . As much as I want to love this lens , this is completely un-acceptable . I wonder how-many people really got a good copy the first time itself . It seems only 1 in 3 to 5 , gets a good copy . Anyways , now I am tired , I just want to return it and forget about it . May be when I have too much time on my hand I may experiment with some other lenses . It is possible this is a specific batch issue , and if anyone cares , lens serial starts with 4000 . But bottom line countless hours are wasted and a frustating experience . And Caution : I gave 1 star , but suddenly when I came back to edit something it took two stars ! ? whats up ? NOTE : I used tripod to test focus issues in good lighting . Update : 01/06/2008 : Anyways I went ahead and bought this lens from another local retailer . This copy did not have focus issues at all . But some how it has too much CA , and lens itself is producing much more softer images ( more so than the one Front Focusing ) . It also has more red tinge to the images . I tried comparing with Kit lens at F3.5 , F 5.6 with exactly same settings , and kit lens is always sharper . So 3 copies , first one Focus issues , 2nd front focussing , 3rd very soft images . Guess what I gave up .  
2	  All , Trust me if you are really looking for great low - high spectrum these are great headphones . You just can't get the sound quality out of the bud styles , these are old school but worth it !  
1	  If you have decided to read these comments you may have seen that 15 out of 17 readers found this review helpful . Honesty dictates I reveal that that statistic pertained to the old review . This review of the AT-PL120 has been extensively rewritten ( Aug . , 2009 ) . I have owned and used this turntable for over a year which has translated into experience with this unit , and a few other direct drive turntables . The AT-PL120 tries really hard to pass itself off as a virtual Technics 1200 series turntable . Do not be fooled by pictures on a web page . It 's only similarity is in appearance . The AT-PL120 comes with a quartz controlled pitch lock which does a good job of keeping platter speeds constant . The platter 's drive motor has abundant torque to keep the platter rotating for record cleaning before playing . The AT-PL120 starts up with the quartz lock disengaged leaving the pitch control slider in control of your platter . If you want the quartz lock in control you must press it 's button every time you turn on the turntable . And , a heads up to any budget minded prospective DJs attracted by this turntable 's " Professional " designation , any messing around you do with popping the platter light up and down , pressing speed control buttons , or moving the slider through it 's center detent will result in ' thumps ' that will be efficiently transmitted to the phono cartridge and mixed with the music . The aluminum platter comes with a felt slip mat which has an enviable capacity to attract static . Often when removing a played record from the platter I found the slip mat clinging for dear life to the underside of the record . As for the platter itself , if you tap it 's outer rim with your fingernail you get a bell-like ringing sound for your effort which the felt slip mat does very little toward dampening . I discovered that a home made cork platter mat made from a 12 " x 12 " cork square available from a local crafts store brought the ringing down to a dull thud . The homemade cork mat does not try to cling to the bottom of the record either . Of course , if you want to keep using the included felt mat , a light application of Gruv-Glide to records as per it 's directions does a nice job of controlling static . The included ATP-2 cartridge is intended for heavy duty DJ use as it needs to track at 3 to 5 grams . That was a bit heavy for my taste so I put the ATP-2 aside until I read a suggestion in another review to try a 205-DET stylus in the cartridge . Since the ATP-2 cartridge is factory aligned in it 's included headshell this was simply a matter or removing the DJ stylus assembly and replacing it with the 205-DET assembly ( Audio Technica ATXN5 stylus ) which can track at a much more acceptable and lighter 1.5 grams . This setup has no glaring sonic vices and is very good at finding high frequency sounds that the Shure M97xE pulls back on . It is one I choose often for rock music listening . Going back for a moment to the fact that the ATP-2 cartridge is factory installed - I checked the Technics 230mm overhang gauge against the factory install and found that the ATP-2 stylus was positioned exactly at the point it would have ended up at had it been installed with the Technics gauge . If you plan to buy extra headshells for extra cartridges for this turntable or if you want to install another cartridge on the included headshell the Technics gauge makes the cartridge alignment process very much easier . It is available online and it is not that expensive . This turntable can produce a hum . Higher output cartridges can be played at lower volume settings which will keep the hum from being heard . Records recorded at higher volume levels also help . Certain discount hit compilation albums recorded at lower volume levels to squeeze an extra song or two onto a side may require higher receiver volume levels for listening and may bring the hum to a level where is audible . We move now to the tonearm which has an adjustable counterweight at the rear . Other reviewers have commented that the counterweight rotates too freely . If you look closely you will find a small slotted set screw on the body of the counterweight . If you tighten this screw just to the point where you feel resistance you will have it set where the counterweight can turn if needed yet remain where you position it . Reviewers have also commented that the rotating gauge on the front of the counterweight also rotates too freely and loses all association it had with the most recent determination of tracking force . Mine had this problem . I eventually resorted to forcing a bit of petroleum jelly into the crack between the gauge and the counterweight which let me move the gauge if needed and yet kept it coupled to the counterweight when I needed to set the tracking force . The next subject has to do with the tonearm 's antiskate feature . With the turntable level and the antiskate setting adjusted to zero the tonearm counterweight is adjusted so the tonearm is floating , balanced and horizontal , and away from the tonearm rest . On my AT-PL120 the tonearm will drift to a position just a bit outward from the edge of the platter and stay there . On my new Technics 1200 the tonearm will stay were originally positioned . On my AT-PL120 moving the antiskate setting to 1 hardly causes any tonearm movement at all . Further increasing the AT-PL120 's tonearm setting to it 's maximum setting 7 causes the tonearm to move only an inch toward the tonearm rest before stopping . On my new Technics 1200 moving the tonearm 's antiskate setting to only 1 will start it on a smooth , easy , yet determined migration toward the tonearm rest where it will not stop until it has met the upright arm of the rest . Recently the AT-PL120 's cueing mechanism lost all it 's dampening fluid leaving a tonearm that descended too rapidly onto the surface of the record . I was directed to an online source which sold me a tube of silicone dampening fluid , a viscous , sticky substance which was applied to the post attached to the tonearm lift . It worked it 's way in and tonearm lift control is again active . To the list of tonearm related woes add a broken tonearm latch , which is the black plastic hook that keeps the tonearm secured to the tonearm rest when the turntable is not being used . I was just routinely easing it off the tonearm to play a record and it just snapped off . The latch is held on by a small Philips head screw on the back side of the tonearm rest post , and is easy enough to replace once you figure out how to get a screwdriver tip into it 's slots . Instead of sending away to Audio-Technica for a replacement latch of similar quality I fashioned a workable latch from a section of a rubber coated paper clip and screwed that on instead . I anticipate it will last much longer than the stock latch . My original magnetic cartridge turntable ( a Technics ) is 28 years old and still has it 's original tonearm latch . Go figure . The last subject relates to setting tonearm assembly height . My factory AT-PL120 manual tells me this feature " .. allows for the tonearm to be positioned parallel to the record surface , when using extra-tall cartridge bodies , thick slip mats , or thick records ( i.e. old 78s ) . " Apparently I can raise the pivot of the tonearm if the cited factors force my headshell higher than the pivot to make the tonearm again level with the record . Unfortunately , out here in the real world , my situation was exactly the opposite . With every cartridge and headshell combination I tried on the AT-PL120 the tonearm pivot was higher than the headshell . I could not lower the pivot from it 's lowest physically possible position to level the tonearm as signs of stressing plastic tonearm assembly parts became evident if I tried to urge it any lower . ( And , yes , the Lock was disengaged . ) In fact , my tonearm could never be lowered to it 's indicated zero setting . It always showed firm resistance at a point between Zero and One best described as 1/4 . It is evident that extra-tall cartridge bodies and thick slip mats and records would actually help in making my AT-PL120 tonearm parallel to the record . On my new Technics 1200 series turntable , using the same cartridges and headshells , I can actually lower the pivot to make the tonearm parallel , and there are subtle yet noticeable sound benefits to be gained from this capability . As for the important question of how did it sound , it could actually sound decent . But I wonder how much of that was due to what the cartridge could do for the turntable . The AT-PL120 is better than the lesser turntables hovering around $ 100 ( I have one of those too in a box somewhere .. ) . The lingering question in my mind is how much better would it sound with a higher quality tone arm that a turntable with an MSRP of $ 399.00 should have ?  
1	  When my computer hard drive began to get too full , and I needed access from several computers without having the others on , I decided on a network attached storage device . I purchased this model because it stated that it offered Internet based document access , supported two USB devices , and you can set up shares , permissions , etc . I was not able to get it to share files over the Internet , the documentation on their website is criptic at best , tech support kept pointing the blame on anything else ( router , modem , even my computer .. ) , but never got that working . BTW - figure on two hours on hold before you get to speak to any technician at Buffalo . I was able to share other USB hard drives , and printers through the USB devices , however I was unable to set up a scanner thru the USB connections . Now , after about 4 mos . of use as a glorified external hard drive , the thing crashed . Buffalo offered to replace it , but not guarantee any of the data , so I had to take it to one of those hard drive recovery professionals to get all my data back ( which cost about twice what it would have had I had a Windows based NAS rather than this Linux - who knew ? ) . Buffalo has refused to reimburse me , so I will probably take the replacement they send me and list it on eBay . I am not certain of the reliability of other NAS , but this one fell well short of my expectations .  
2	  After read the reviews , I am afraid my TV will come with a total dead one . I have tested it immediately once it was delivered . It works fine as TV and monitor . The picture is not as good as brand name 's . But what could you say with this price ? If you have a limited budget go for it .  
2	  I would recommend this radio to anyone . In fact , I just ordered one for my father for Christmas . The reception is the best I 've ever experienced . Overall the sound is powerful . The bass is deep . The treble is lively . The product has some weight to it and really feels like a high quality , solid design . But best of all , the controls are simple . It 's very easy to set the alarm and turn it on and off . Even when you are half in a daze in the wee hours of the morning it 's easy to operate . I also like the fact that the standard snooze is tem minutes but with each press of the button the snooze time increases five minutes . I 've had it for four months and it 's worth every penny in my opinion .  
2	  These DVD + RW 's work great with our Gateway DVD player . And you can't beat the great low price .  
2	  I just want to start from saying that this is not $ 1000 or more DSLR camera so I did not expect to see high quality pictures when I first bought it . However after taking few images in full sun I was pleased with image quality taking into account small lens and price of the camera ( I paid $ 56 for refurbished one with 90 day Nikon warranty ) . All pictures came out sharp with true colors . I did not see single one that was blurred . Macro worked fine too . In low light condition story is a little different . It appears that flash fires always with the same power so you need to keep approximately 5 " to 6 " from the subject all the time to avoid under or overexposed pictures . I got better results ( in low light condition ) using museum mode ( BSS is on ) . There are lots of things I like about this camera : size , metal body , lens built inside , nice features like 4 assists modes , 15 scene modes , D-lighting , picture editing , voice recording , date imprint , color options , excellent movie modes and many , many more . Everything works as it should ( I checked them all ) . It is easy to use without reading manual ( may be to me becasue I own Coolpix 5700 ) . I could wish only for manual mode . I read a lot of complaints about blurry pictures , noise etc . One can set ISO to low value and use tripod to get good pictures . Do not expect that tiny lens to pass enough light so camera sets low ISO and short exposure time avoiding blurry / noisy pictures . I do not think that you can show me better camera in that size and in this price . There is really nothing not to like about this camera , you just need to read manual and experiment with settings to get good results .  
1	  I purchased these headphones for use in the office . The integrity of the headphones is fine and the setup was fairly easy . I was excited to try them out . The sound quality of the headphones is terrible even with them 3 ft from the sensor I still get static . I tried a number of distances but even as far as the edge of my cube they are breaking up really bad . This product will be returned to Amazon .  
2	  This lens is permanently fixed to one of my 1DMkII cameras because it 's the perfect focal length for most general situations . This lens is super-sharp and super-fast . One of the best lens in my bag .  
1	  This is my 3rd Garmin GPS device .. and I 'm disappointed in both the reliability and the support . After 5 weeks , the Bluetooth feature worked only sporadically and then the unit just died . I called support and after close to 45 minutes on hold , talked to a rep . He finally agreed to have me return the unit via UPS overnight and that a new unit would be returned to me via UPS overnight . I sent it in and they received it on a Friday . I had to call again to determine when it would be returned .. and received a replacement unit about a week later after sending it in . That second unit worked for five days and then died . Called support again and after a 40 minute wait , talked to another rep . That rep thought it was a software problem and recommended I download new software . But first I had to wait 48 hours for the internal battery to fully discharge .. apparently there 's a software bug that blocks the screen from displaying data . Why they shipped a replacement unit with " old " software is a complete mystery to me ( and to the rep ) . It seems to be working now and we 'll see if it remains working for more than a month . I 'm surprised about this as both Garmin devices I 'd owned previously were pretty much trouble free . And I 'm really disappointed in the lack of " service recovery " that Garmin displayed .  
1	  in that the disc only recorded on both sides for a short time . an error message appeared that the second said could not be use to record after about 4 or 5 uses .  
2	  I ordered this through Etronics . When I got it I didn't notice it at first but soon realized that they had sent a 32D46 which is identical to this model except that the screen is not flat . I checked Etronics web site and they list the 32D46 at the price advertized here and they list the 32DF46 at $ 499 . What I don't know is whether Etronics being listed here selling this model is an honest mistake or an intentional deception but it was no mistake on Etronics part ! The packing slip clearly showed that they had crossed out the 32DF46 and replaced it with the 32D46 ! What was * REALLY * irritating is that they didn't even bother to notify me of the change before shipping it , if they had I probably would have canceled the order . Now if I want to get what I ordered , I 'd have to ship it back to them probably at my expense plus pay the difference in price and then probably the cost of shipping the correct model to me . In all an extra $ 220 in shipping charges plus I 'd be without a TV while waiting for delivery of the correct model . With all that in mind , I 'll likely just keep it despite that it isn't what I ordered . But I will make sure Etronics and Amazon know my feelings about this mis-listing and my disappointment at not getting what I had ordered . The bottom line is . If you * really * want the flat screen 32DF46 , DO NOT buy from Etronics ! You won't get it ! This is a great TV though , other reviewers are right that the tuner is slow , but that doesn't bother me since I 'm not a channel surfer anyway , when I sit down to watch TV it 's to watch a specific show or a DVD . Don't know what other people see wrong with the picture , some have said the colors were weak . I actually had to turn down the color a little . No weakness here ! I love the digital reception capability ! I can't pickup analog signals too well but the digital signals come in extremely well . Using just a bare wire attached to a coax cable I could pull in most of the local stations , imagine what a proper antenna will do ! Once I have that set up and receiving all the local stations which is all I 'm interested in , the cable is history ! I also like the Stable Sound feature , it 's really annoying when you 're watching TV and a commercial come on and blasts you into next week . Doesn't happen with Stable Sound , the volume stays where you set it . Very nice feature Toshiba ! Over all I 'm very pleased with this TV , just wish it was the flat screen model I had ordered .  
2	  with this product , there is a learning curve .. as with all dvd players , you have to adjust the settings for your liking .. the price of this player and the quality I get from it is amazing .. I have to agree with the reviewer who said he needed to set it up for best results .. if you are the type of person that can not figure out how to set up electronic devises , THEN READ THE MANUAL ! the hd tv I have only displays up to 1080i .. but the quality isn't very good .. that 's because it is interlaced and I am used to pro-scan .. so I receive a better picture at 720p .. so play with the settings and you 'll be happy at the price point .. and as for running it directly through your tv .. don't expect the sound from a tv channel .. IT IS A DIFFERENT SIGNAL ALL TOGETHER ! run it through your stereo for best results .. for 50 bucks you can't beat this player ..  
2	  Very pleased with the quality of both video and picture capabilities . Blows my HP built in webcam away . Bargain price for the red version . Highly recommend this product .  
1	  I had this attached to a PC in the garage , and it died after a couple of months . Not sure if it is was a problem with the environment - dust , moisture , etc . I liked it for value / functionality , but be warned it may not be suitable for rugged environments .  
1	  This is a link from the Coby website . Mine does not ' spin up ' so can't read disks after 2 months of ownership and maybe 15 hours of use . " To obtain warranty replacement , return the product freight prepaid to the address below within the duration of the warranty . Please enclose the product , copy of receipt , detailed description of the problem and a money order in the monetary amount found on your warranty card . The money order should be made out to COBY ELECTRONICS and covers the cost of return shipping and handling . " They want me to pay a HANDLING fee on top of return postage - and maybe more if they determine that I somehow caused the problem . Forget this company . Bad Coby , Bad !  
1	  Sent these back . They were out of alignment so everything was double vision . The field of view is very narrow making your subject difficult to find . Every time you move them you have to refocus and the focus mechanism had a no movement gap when changing directions . This was aggravating . I will be looking for an alternative .  
1	  It seems that this is a real problem . This card doesn't work with most VIA chipsets ( that means AMD processors ) . My computer freeze often and only the reset button is available :) . I tryed all the drivers found on Internet . The results are negative . So , there is anybody who wants to buy a lazy soundblaster ? I think this is the worst soundblaster I had .  
2	  This worked great for me I don't know what all the hate is for I mean it does say it is specifically for the sidewinder in the title , great creates a lot of precision and makes the game very realistic .  
2	  The Tripp Lite Isobar Ultra first drew my attention when I went to work for a local communications company . I noticed that in every one of our offices and in almost all of our customers ' businesses , equipment was plugged into one of these puppies , from the smallest they offer to the largest . I have witnessed lightning storms that have literally blown sockets out of walls , and yet the equipment plugged into the Isobar has remained intact . Granted , some of the Isobars didn't fare as well as the equipment they protected , but they did their job . Having witnessed the quality of this product , I trust it in my own home . Everything from my computer to my entertainment center to my paper shredder is attached to an Isobar Ultra . I highly recommend it for it 's quality and performance .  
1	  I had to buy a new battery for my camera because my old one was flashing the charger and after I called the company they said that I would need to buy a new battery . I looked on the website for the camera and it would be about $ 40 so I went onto Amazon and looked at the same batteries for about 70 % cheaper and after paying for it and for shipping I get the battery and it also didn't work . I also bought a new charger also with the same problem so I had to end up buying another broken battery or charger and a new camera . Very unhappy with this purchase .  
2	  I didn't think I would be too into the whole Tivo thing when I bought this for my husband , but WOW , it relly does change how you watch tv ! I just wish I would have bought the 80-hr . one , so I wouldn't have to wonder when shows might be deleted to make room for new ones . This one works excellent though , it did stop and reboot a couple times since we had it , but I 'm sure it needed to do so to run properly . Nothing erases when this happens , it just takes about 5 or 6 minutes to start up again , everything is still there when it comes back . Just so you know if you by one , you do have to pay for monthly service and it does need to be connected to a phone line ( I had to run a 50 ft . cord long the ceiling from my kitchen since our living room doesn't have a hookup ) .  
2	  Shipped fast and advertised . No problems . Easy install electronics . Looks just like picture . Seems like a good deal . Packaged well .  
1	  The seller advertises this as the original replacement part from HP , its no such thing , when you get yours id suggest you test it with a multimeter to make sure it provides the right Voltage for your laptop so as not to fry it with this cheap chinesse PoC . It will get hot , very hot within a couple hours of use so beware of placing it over rugs or clothes . If you smell it from a close distance it resembles of burnt electronics . I 'd stay away from this adapter and seller in the future .  
1	  While the price was inviting , I paid twice as much for shipping . 2.98 per cable to ship are you kidding me . I was planning on ordering 6 or so for future use , but after I saw $ 35 in shipping fees I decided not to do that . It is still cheaper than I can buy at my local electronics store but I think their shipping calculations are crazy .  
1	  This product arrived with two out of three leg joints snapped in their sockets . The plastic 's so brittle it didn't survive UPS . Disappointing , especially as I bought the big binoculars , the ones requiring a sturdier tripod . Having unwrapped a potentially useful item , I now have to rewrap a bundle of scrap .  
1	  I ordered the camera case because it was listed as an accessory for a specific camera . It did not fit , but luckily I knew someone with that size camera that was able to use it . Before an item is listed as an accessory it should be verified that it fits that main item .  
2	  If you are like me , you can name a dozen items that you own that you put in the category of " could not or would not like to live without . " My iPod is one , my Panasonic LX-3 camera is one , my Jim Thompson canvas bag from Thailand is one , my Tag Heuer Carrera automatic black-face watch , my Logitec Anywhere MX wireless mouse , and this monopod , which I have had for years , is one . It is very useful and beautifully engineered and constructed . It is not for heavy equipment , obviously , but for a light-weight camera it is easy to carry around and just perfect . You won't be sorry . What a deal at this price !  
1	  I purchased this LCD new in Oct . I had problems with the picture immediately . A tech came out and could not fix the problem by inserting a new board . Next the TV set " died " no power , picture or sound . Panasonic customer service is awful , awful , awful . I have tried repeatedly to get the set replaced to no avail . I have called time and time again and received nothing but the run around . I am now waiting for a power board to come in . It will take 30 additional days . I have owned a $ 1,700 for 5 months and it has worked for 30 days . Panasonic customer support is a joke ! I would not purchase any Panasonic product again . I would suggest buying a company that stands behind their product . If anyone wants a more detailed review feel free to contact me . @ auciello @ tampabay . rr . com  
2	  I needed a smaller Boom Box that would sit on my night stand w / o taking up too much space . And also one that was portable enough to take from room to room as well as outside . This one fits the bill exactly . If extreme volume is important to you , this is not the boom box to purchase . Like the box the speakers are small therefore the range of volume is limited . I 've been very pleased . Amazon 's price for this model was a little higher than on another very popular site . However , it qualified it for free shipping and handling which the other site did not offer . This made the Amazon box a few dollars cheaper . Others have had problems with the quality . I have had the box for three months and it is holding up very well . I Plan to purchase at least two more in the near future .  
2	  These are probably the best headphones i have ever bought in my life . The sound is pretty good , i 'm sure there are better but given the price they stand up pretty well . Where they don't stand up though , is durability . Expect them to break , and to be very sad when they break . They 'd be a lot nicer if they weren't made out of plastic . I would shop around and maybe look at some metal headphones ( I assume they exist ) or other reviews before you buy them .  
1	  These were replacements for a pair of Koss headphones that broke . I went overboard ensuring the same thing didn't happen here and bought the Panzer tank of headphones . These things sound * really * nice , but they have two problems . - As said many times , they are extremely heavy . Between the weight of the phones and the excellent seal that they create on my ears I can hear and feel my pulse beating in my head . It 's actually very distracting after the novelty wears off . Also , I can feel the central bar on top of my head ; the phones are so heavy I feel it weighing more and more until I have to take them off . - To listen to these phones on a computer or ipod you need the adapter . If you jiggle the adapter at all you get feedback crackling . I haven't had a stereo in almost a decade , so every time I use these I have to tiptoe around the connector . I work in a loud environment and this makes these phones more trouble than they 're worth . So if you are a cheap audiophile , go for it . Sound is great on these , and they are quieter than my " noise-cancelling " headphones . But for iPod / mp3 players they are nearly useless . You spend so much time worrying about touching the connector .. Even plugged into my laptop at work I have to pay attention to how my wrist moves the cord to avoid crackling . As I write this my head is starting to hurt and my pulse is pounding in my head again . Lame sauce . I 'm going to replace these .  
1	  Bought the 25 ft which worked fine , however the 14 foot cut in and out with signal and only after I replaced it was everything working as expected . Unfortunately , probably more trouble to actually return it .  
2	  Really cheap . works great . elsewhere its $ 199.99very happy with this purchase .  
1	  I 've had this camera for a couple of years now and though it has never taken very good photos , it was good enough for the snapshots I take ( not much of a photographer ) though quite pricey at the time I bought it . I have never used it much but in the last year it intermittently refuses to turn on . It doesn't matter if I have fresh batteries in it or not . Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't . If I take the batteries out and put them back in that will sometimes get it to work . Regardless , Kodak knows about the problem as I am not alone with this issue but they are doing nothing about it . Frankly , I think Kodak has terrible low end and mid range products ( I also have a Kodak AIO that I spent a fortune on that is hardly used and needs new printheads ) and their customer service reps are in denial . I 'm not sure why they call it " support . " Once upon a time when I was young Kodak had one of the best reps around but not anymore . I will never buy their products again . I suggest that you get a better camera from Sony or Cannon . They 're better quality for your money .  
2	  I just bought this set for ~ 50 euro and I can almost compare it to a full-size audio speaker set of 10 times the price . Of course it does not have the depth as the more expensive sets but bass as well as treble is great . Very clear sound . I wish i could have bought something like this when I was young and had to buy large , unwieldy speakers . Nice thing also that these kind of speakers can be used on anything with a headphone connection .  
2	  I 've used SanDisk cards before for my digital camera . I trust the brand and will continue to buy SanDisk cards .  
2	  i bought this camera for my sister who is obsessed with coach purses . she cant thank me enough . if buying for a female , definantly purchase coach carrying case . This camera is so tiny ! its a great gift for any age over 13  
1	  I purchased this player ( RP2520 ) while on vacation . I had dropped my faithfull and workhorse AVC Soulplayer DMP-01 ( basically a Re-branded Rio Volt SP100 or SP90 ) while exercising . After five years of service , I needed an MP3 player to get me through my 20 + hour drive home . I only had MP3 CDs with me . I went to three ( national chain ) stores on my last day of vacation and this RCA was the only one that had easy folder navigation ( all my MP3 CDs contain albums , each in their own folder ) and it came with a car kit at the cheapest price anywhere . It seemed like a good value at the time . Well , you get what you pay for . The unit plays audio CDs without skipping at all , but MP3 CDs will lock and skip .. and I burn all mine to CD-Rs ( not CD-RWs ) . The problem gets worse as you get near the end of CD . Now , any album I have that is only encoded at 160kbps or less ( which is not very many ) plays fine . VBR ( variable bit rate ) and 192/224/320kbps encoded MP3 have trouble after about 1-2 songs . It 's as if the buffer gets full , and it 's all downhill afterwards . I use high quality name-brand CD-Rs ( Sony , Verbatim , TDK , etc ) . It doesn't matter which brand . MP3s all skip . Audio CDs and Audio CD-Rs all play fine . Strange and sad really . I tried returning the unit for a second player .. it did the exact same thing . So back to the store both units went . I guess I 'll try to find a used Soulplayer or Volt SP100 / SP90 / SP250 somewhere . My Soulplayer never skipped on me once ( too bad they don't make ' em anymore ) . I 've heard good things about iRiver players too , maybe I 'll have to look into those as well .  
1	  Whilst this product revolutionizes the way you access and browse the internet and is great for multiple access points ( we have 2 laptops ) it falls short in a number of areas . The primary problem is that that it interferes with all phones - even non wireless fixed lines . For our cordless phone ( we are on our 3rd ) we have tried the 900mhz , 2.4ghz and the latest 5 + ghz cordless phones . It is hopeless . Anyway , when it comes down to it I 'd prefer to loose the phones rather than my wireless connection so i guess we are stuck !  
1	  The 4330 camera was wonderful when new , but when it was 10 months old it started acting funny and when contacted kodak they recommended new batteries and holding the camera steady for correcting the sometimes blurry picts , the camera was purchased for a friend in June and her birthday was middle of July , a couple months ago it started acting up and lately it is hard to get to turn on and when you do it turns it 's self off and then wont come back on for awhile , Kodak says if you send back for 200 dollars can fix it but like others on Amazon . com it will only start acting up in a few months again , After paying $ 300 dollars for a camera it sucks when it is not dependable nor backed by the manufacture , would not buy another Kodak product if was only one on market  
2	  nice metal box , great upgrade from the Netgear EN104tp i was using previously .. but im somewhat jaded as every thing on my network that ive bought instead of been given is netgear ..  
1	  I just followed the instructions on the bottle and used this on my LCD computer monitor . It left streaks all over my monitor . My suggestion is to use a microfiber cloth and distilled water . You might get streaks doing that , but you will with this product as well ( and water is a lot cheaper ) . Don't waste your money .  
2	  The Sony CMT-NEZ30 offers a good amount for a stereo this size , as it truely is tiny , and is great for those that dont want to sacrifice a lot of space , or have a mini-system that looks like a kids toy . This is perfect for your bedroom , kitchen , office , or den , as once again , it is small , and it even looks great sitting on top on your furniture as its speakers have a simulated walnut color to make it blend in . As for the sound quality , it produced a nice clean sound for the size ( the speakers woofers are only 3 1/2 inches ) , and it has lots of features such as a loudness / bass boast button , and seperate bass and treble controls . The 30watts is a perfect size amplifier to produce decent sound levels for a small room . It does have some disadvantages though . First off , even though the sound quality is good , the bass reponse is a bit flat , and even though you can cut the treble down , its a little bright on the high end , but once again , I only reccomend this for a small room , if you are looking for a micro system that is going to produce deep bass reponse for you living room or dorm room , then I dont reccomend this . Once again , if you want something that sounds better then a boombox , and looks better too , then this is a great system , and even though Sony is usually overpriced , this is a great buy , as strange as it is , Sony Audio is always usually resonable priced , unlike their TV 's or Playstation 3 which cost a bloody fortune . Still the best in its class for the price as the Panasonic Micro system which is a bit smaller then this , and about ten bucks cheaper , sounds horrid , and has no volume , so this is the way to go for a micro system unless you feel like shelling out a thousand bucks for a Boise . ENJOY  
2	  Personally , I like most all of the Pentax camers . I 've had a few before this one , and they all functioned great . Teh Optio T20 is awesome with its toutch screen , great quality in it 's pictures too . The T20 has decent functions in its menus , although it could use maybe a little more . The only draw back to this is the lack of a view finder . But , if your looking for a large LCD screen on the back , your not going to find many with a viewfinder anyways . And if your looking at the size of the screen for the T20 , your not going to find one better . Great quality , brillian colors ..  
1	  The SECOND time I removed the iPAQ from the case the Velcro stuck to the case and would not stick to the iPAQ again . What do you do then ? Without Velcro , the case does not serve its purpose - or the hand held bounces around inside . I have contacted Sumdex , but have not heard from them yet . Velcro is great but ..  
1	  This design didn't pull enough heat away from my Sony VAIO laptop that always ran hot - not sure anything in production now would work perfectly , but I know this one didn't .  
1	  Turns out the cleaner solution is DISTILLED WATER . Cloth covered " brush " not really large enough to get a good handle on it . Could so as well with a towel and water . NOT WORTH THE PRICE >  
2	  Living in an Amazon dist . city ( Phoenix ) shipping is really fast . I can order something on one day and it will be at my house the next day . I 've even had Amazon deliver something with what appeared somebody 's personal car , on a Sat . This router setup was extemely easy ( using WPA2 ) and the range is great , full coverage on a 2500 sq / ft house . So far no problems at all , it should be noted that it is powered by an APS UPS system , so it 's always powered on with filtered / AC / battery backup .  
1	  Canon 250D 58mm Close-up Lens for A700 , A710IS , G1 , G2 , G3 , G5 , G6 & EOS SLR CamerasI was quite pleased to order this pack . Imagine my disappointment when I received it and found I couldn't use it without an accessory adapter . This fitting is not available for shipmwnt to Canada , so I am left with a package that cost me more than $ 140.00 that is useless to me . I feel that the vendor should have noted the delivery address and highlighted this problem . I would really like to be able to use these accessories that I received .  
1	  The reviews for this camera are great . The video is indeed incredible , beyond anything i 've experienced with a consumer camcorder . But there are big problems if you really want to enjoy the video you shoot . Before I continue I will give some background on my family . I am a 33 year expert in television production . I have produced and edited several television shows . My daughter who also intended to use the camera is an IT professional who is helps corporate users with software and hardware problems . Neither of us could get the video shot on the camcorder 's RAM 's disc in a usable form on either a Windows PC or a Apple IMAC G5 . After repeated calls to Panasonic 's technical support they were not able to resolve any of our major problems . They person who was in charge of training others at their support system admitted they did not even have this camera or the stripped down D250 model at their facility to test or train with . Even though their manual has more than 10 pages dealing with using the camcorder with an APPLE , they said they would provide no support for Apple owners . On the Windows side the camera can not be even recognized if you have the popular ROXIO software on your computer . Once that was removed we got video but no sound . With the MAC we got the video and sound in , but there is no way the video could be converted to be able to work with APPLE 's iMOVIE or iDVD software . In this day and age where hardware is getting so complex , poorly trained customer support is inexcusable . By the way I own two Panasonic DVD Recorders , two other Panasonic DVD players , and a Panasonic portable DVD player , so I was certainly inclined to want to say good things about this company . I returned my camcorder to AMAZON today .  
1	  I find that most of the prior criticisms are accurate . Most of the cool extras , the media sliders , the little screen , etc . are " gimmicks " that don't work properly and offer little functionality . The keyboard has a nice feel once you get used to it , but if you let it sit for more then 5 minutes , it must go into some kind of battery conservation mode and when you type something it repeats the first letter keyed . I have not been able to find and disable this " feature " . The chief problem is the mouse . I simply have never had a Bluetooth Wireless device that really worked . The mouse inexplicitly hangs and stops working . This problem will continue for seconds or minutes at a time . Sometimes you must open the mouse software and fiddle with the connection settings . The mouse also is heavy and feels blocky in my hand . That 's a personal preference though . The unit does look great however , and if you rank style over substance you might like it . If you are like me and are trying to get as much done in as little time as possible , having to stop and fiddle with something as simple as a mouse is unacceptable . Finally , be careful installing the included software . It includes a lot of unnecessary and undesirable media software which wants to run in the background , bog down your system , and continually try to direct you to Logitech pay sites .  
1	  Summary : This joystick is junk . Spend a little more money and buy something better . Although it has a great feel , the hardware is of the lowest quality . They don't last and are constantly loosing calibration . Furthermore , the certain features like the throttle slider , never work properly ( full throttle on the joystick doesn't make full throttle in the game ) . Also , the software is poor . Both the drivers and their task-tray application are sub-standard . Looks like Logitech outsourced everything about this joystick . Cheap junk !  
2	  It did take a bit of time to figure out how to use it although it appeared to be quite simple at first . The instructions say that the iPod Shuffle need not be turned on if the speakers are plugged in but after struggling with it for a while I realized that the Shuffle had to be turned on or otherwise there will be no sound coming out from the speakers . But after you figure out how to work it , it is actually a very good product . There are several speakers for Shuffle out there but the prices are often higher than the price of the Shuffle or for the cheaper versions , they don't sound very good at all . This one , however , is excellent . The size makes it truly portable . The sound is great . I think it is plenty loud for speakers this size , and the quality is very good . If you are not looking for Bose quality ( then again , why would you for the price you pay for this one ) , then this is truly excellent . I was very apprehensive at first , but I am convinced . This is worth your money and you will enjoy it very much . One drawback is that , since it has a place for everything ( storing the shuffle itself and the ear piece ) , there is no place to store the electric cord and plug . I will mention that it does take batteries if you are travelling in the car or so . It would be nice though if for later version they can include an adapter for the car as well .  
2	  at first I was very skeptical to purchase this strip from reading all the bad reviews It got . The reason why I got it is for my Mame cabinet , as an easy all in one switch solution for when I power on the cabinet . On the control outlet I have my PC hooked up , and on the white outlets I have my marquee light , speakers , and monitor hooked up . I did have to adjust the little sensitivity nob on the side a little to get it to work properly , but it literally took two minutes to find the right sensitivity . Now all my peripherals turn on and off when the PC turns on and off . I 'm not sure if people aren't setting it right or aren't even trying to set it to begin with ( make sure you read the instructions , the setting knob is allowed to make up to 1 full turn . don't go over that or force it , I only needed a half a turn for my setup , also the instructions state that if you are trying to turn on lights , they have to be at least 40 watt for incandescent , and 7 watt for fluorescent ) . To me it seemed super easy , maybe I was just one of the few lucky people who didn't get a defective strip . Either way I highly recommend it if you are looking for a solution to turn all your peripherals off at the push of one button .  
1	  The earpiece and mike are good if the connection would stay in the radio . I am using this with my MR350 . Not sure if it is because the connector on the headset is so large or the rubber cover on the radio , but the connection continuoulsy pops out of the radio at the slightest touch , leaving the mike open and no one able to communicate with you . Not sure if this is just with these radios but I would not recommend this set with the MR350 's  
1	  Contrary to popular myth , this is NOT an MP3 player . It only plays a proprietary format . The PC desktop software will convert MP3 music to the proprietary format - and it will rip CDs to the proprietary format - but it 's still a proprietary format . Additionally , after you have gone through the trouble and effort of making one of the mini-CDs it is only usable on Sony products . If your next MP3 player is an MP3 player versus a Sony lock-in , your mini-disks and the data they contain are useless . You 'll have to go through and reconvert all of your songs . Even more irritating is that the software can only be run if you are logged in to the administrator account . Given Sony 's root-kit fiascoes , do you trust them ? Since the unit was purchased for my daughter , she has to ask permission to be logged into the computer each time she wants to make a new disk . My daughter finally decided that she really didn't like the mini-disk format and wanted a flash memory based MP3 player . We purchased a Sansa .. and had to convert all of her songs again . ( We are happy with the Sansa ) .  
1	  I initially bought my archos and was very excited to use it but then I began to use it and things went down hill from there . They say you can excercise with this thing but that is total BS . Every single time I have run with my archos is conks out on me . They actually replaced my first unit and it still had the same issues . Tech support is useless and the co . doesn't stand behind their products . If you are thinking about getting one of these , think again and pay the extra money to get a product that works .  
1	  Terribly written software . The installation process was a nightmare . After installing the application I tried to install 9 CDs worth of maps . After each disc the installer crashed so I had to restart the application repeatedly . It got stuck on on disc an was never able to complete the installation . With the maps I did install I found the navigation and software interface to be SLOW and not intuitive . It was a waste of money and I have returned the software to the seller .  
1	  I got this filter before I understood the difference between cheap filters and ones that actually work well . I was getting such great results with my new 50mm f / 1.8 lens during the day , but at night i was getting a lot of ghosting and flaring in my pictures . It took me a while to realize it was because of the filter . After doing some online research , I decided to remove the filter , and my pictures were all suddenly better with that lens . The glass was affecting my picture quality ! The glass used is cheap , and not very good quality , so it can actually degrade your pictures . It works well to protect the glass on the lens from scratches or dust , but it 's a much better idea to pay $ 20 more and get a good filter that will actually help you get better pictures . If you don't want to pay the extra for a decent filter , you might be better off just leaving the filter off . I reccomend Hoya Pro1 and B & W ; filters ; and in the 52mm size , the price is very reasonable . Once you start buying nicer lenses that require 77mm filters , that 's where the good filters really start adding up . But again , you aren't going to want to put a cheap filter on a $ 1000 lens . I know this review might sound negative , but if it helps someone capture a memory better because they decided to get a little nicer filter , it will be worth it .  
1	  I bought this drive for a custome built computer . I have used a few maxtor HD 's before but I havent used one in any of my own computers . This hard drive worked for about 4 months . then my computer started crashing randomly . I thought it was because I had a virus ( and incident with Kazaa ) so I tried re-installing XP . During installation , setup said that some files wern't installed but i could go on and run XP without some . After installation the computer still randomly restarted . a few days later when I booted up , I headrd a horrable grinding noise and my comp quit working all together . Yes it was the hard drive all along . dont take chances with maxtor . western digital has much more stable and dependable hard drives  
1	  The product description says it works on " almost any surface , " but I have yet to find a surface where it works other than a white counter top . Switching back to the Microsoft Laser Mouse 6000 , which actually does work on any surface , and returning this useless mouse .  
1	  This antenna does only work with old school Sirius devices . All Sirius XM devices use a different voltage that the one supported by this antenna . Buy the Pixel PRO-600 instead .  
1	  Maybe I 'm new to this printer ink game but in my experience I get printer ink cartridges that have the electronic chip on them that allows you to insert them into a print so they start printing immediately . They do say in the title tag here WITHOUT CHIP , but I didn't pick up on it and just wanted to warn any future buyers that in order to get these to work you 'll have to use razor blades and double stick tape to transfer the electronic chip to these ghetto little ink cartridges . Canon doesn't make them and I doubt they 're even legal . What kind of third world company sells ink without an electronic chip . I give it an extra star for me being an idiot and not realizing that WITHOUT CHIP means without the essential printer ink cartridge electronic chip that all ink cartridges should have .  
2	  I have been looking all over the place for this cartridge . Most stores don't have them anymore . Thanks for not only having it in stock , but getting it to me so quickly .  
1	  I wanted something to improve the 2 bars of my Dlink DIR655 router . This certainly was not it . It took my bars down to 0 to 1 and at times-NONE - . You cant move it far , as the cable is only 3 feet . Maybe it worksfor some people in certain circumstances , but not for me . I returned it .  
1	  I 've owned Skullcandy headphones before and didn't have this problem , but these headphones just aren't very loud , even with the subwoofer deployed . The whole reason I listen to headphones is when I want to blast music , and these just don't do the trick . EDIT : THESE HEADPHONES STOPPED WORKING AFTER LESS THAN A MONTH OF USE . THE CONNECTIONS IN THE CABLE CAME APART IN SEVERAL PLACES WITH NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR ! DON'T BUY THESE !  
1	  This product sucks . We have a superfast DSL WAN that works awesome . However , when the Linksys router gets plugged in ( routing three computers ) our BW drops from 272.8 kbps to a range of 22.5 - 40.0 . We checked it on ( an internet site 's ) BW tester . Even if all three of us were up and running - we still can't multiple 40 x3 and get 272.2 . We lost 150kbps using it !  
1	  I live in a high rise , and I think there are too many other signals floating around . The UFO worked sporadically at first , and now , not at all . I 've tried changing the batteries , moving the transmitter , attaching the " eye " in various locations , but no dice . Too bad , because I really wanted this to work .  
1	  I just returned from China . While there I had to request an adapter from about 1/2 of the hotels because this one didn't fit . Also , while you can force a 3 prong plug into it , it is too difficult to do and then remove for this to be considered usuable for a 3 prong plug . I wouldn't buy again and depending on the cost and trouble may return this one .  
2	  We purchased about 10 of these for our school . They work well with the wireless system . Need to be attentive to the installation instructions . A good buy .  
2	  I needed to connect a new Vista 64 computer ( parallel port-less ) to a legacy ( Designjet 220 usb & network-less ) engineering plotter . A replacement plotter would have cost several thousands of dollars . Two 16 ' Tripp Lite cables ( without an additional power source ) did the trick . Works flawlessly .  
2	  I am not the photography end user of this product . I purchased as a gift . The photographer seemed pleased . Amazon handled my order with their usual proficiency .  
2	  Worked excellent i haven't had a single problem with them at all ! I can walk all the way down the block with good signal still and the battery life is im impressive . A rich bass along with great tremble definitely buy these for listening to music off of your computer or anywhere else .  
2	  I researched filters and this one is well rated and at a good price . I have had several of them and have saved my lense a couple of times . Shipping was a bit slow , but still acceptable timing .  
2	  This thing rocks . It changed the way I think about life . The world is a much better place .. Everything is clearer now ..  
1	  Elite Screens sell at a very good price , which sold me on this one . Well , I got what I paid for and it came broken with the center rod ( on which all the winding is done ) was disengaged and unusable . This was the second Elite Screen I have had which had this problem , and after doing more checking I found it is a common problem . I recommend considering other companies at this low cost end of the screen market .  
1	  I bought it because it was priced well and had the HD upconvert feature . Recording was no problem - no issues there . My problems were with playback . The player began showing the alternate language subtitles on store-purchased movies . I could not turn OFF this feature - it had a mind of it 's own . The last straw was skipping from chapter to chapter - in random order , again on store-purchased movies . This piece of junk now resides on the garbage , where it belongs !  
2	  Within just 10-15 minutes of comparing the Logitech V450 with a Microsoft 3000 , I noticed that the 3000 simply feels more natural , more substantial , and more supportive in my large paw than the V450 . ( The V450 , however , feels like it 's heavier and thus a smoother tool to use , probably due to taking 2 AA batteries vs . the 3000 's 1 AA battery . ) Here might be some reasons why the 3000 fits better to me : - The front ( button ) half and the rear ( supposedly palm rest ) half of the 3000 's top surfaces slope at a greater degree than the V450 's . - The tallest point of the 3000 probably is shorter than the V450 's , but is situated more towards the buttons than the V450 . - The 3000 appears oh-so-slightly taller than the V450 along the front edge , above the buttons . - The side rubber grip surfaces also feel better with the 3000 . This combination of very subtle physical dimension differences somehow seems to give the 3000 an edge over the V450 for big hand / long finger support . I have more places and ways , in more hand positions , to adequately " rest " my 4th and 5th fingers with the 3000 vs . the V450 . Also , wheel scrolling with the V450 feels crippling - which can't be good , since that 's my clue that prolonged usage may result in lovely things like CTS and what-not . Strangely still , the V450 is the longer mouse , with a taller ' peak ' and a longer button surfaces . Although the Logitech V450 gives me more of a kick , because of the laser precision tracking ( mouse movements feel more organic than the 3000 - and I could probably make good use of it on glossy Starbucks tables ) , of the battery metering , the weightiness , the cool , slick USB micro-receiver ( * half * the size of the 3000 's ugly one ! ) that slips surreptitiously into the slick , black underside of the V450 , and that the V450 actually comes with 2 AA batteries ! , and its superior fit and finish over the 3000 ( the fit and feel of the 3000 seems it was injection-molded out of some sub-par industrial-strength manufacturing process ) , I must * very reluctantly * go with the 3000 , even though I 'm not the biggest MSFT Hardware fan . So , there you have it , You Big-Hand Notebook User .  
2	  I have tried in the past to use on-ear headphones , but my hair covers my ears , and it doesn't really work . These clip-ons seemed like a solution ( IEMs get uncomfortable after a while and block out all outside sounds , which I don't always want ) . Looks : god , if these aren't the best looking pair of headphones this side of 200 bucks . Granted , I feel obliged to preserve their brushed-aluminum beauty to the extent that I will only store them in the fussy ( but high-quality ) case that comes with them . Even the corrugated-plastic packaging was pretty . Sound : my only other pair of phones are Klipsch Custom 2 IEMs , which are fantastic , and at half the price , I expected nothing like the sound that comes from the ATH-EM7s , which are pretty damn good , and as good as it will get for $ 50 . Besides on-the-go listening , these phones are great for when you just want to listen to music loud and don't want to " appreciate " so much as " rock out " ( which can be a painful experience with IEMs ) . Comfort : finding the right position for the earpieces takes some time ( but not nearly as long as it did for my Klipschs ) , but once you do , there is a significant amount of leeway in the comfort zone , and they will stay comfortable for a long time . I only hit the comfort wall after wearing them for hours on end multiple days in a row . Ergonomics : the cord can be a hassle ; it 's heavier , and all the weight rests on one ear , which can irritate it . It is also longer than necessary , I think , but makes sense if you listen to music from your computer often , instead of a portable player . Quality : it 's made of solid metal with some rubber bits , I doubt the feel could be any classier than it already is . The cord has a habit of twisting around itself , but is effectively tangle-proof , and seems sturdy . A bonus : one of the screws came loose the other day , and the unit attached to the earpieces was jiggling ; I took out an Allen key and tightened it . Power to the people !  
2	  This is just a great buy ! Come on , a 16GB Corsair Flash Drive for $ 20 ! You can't beat that . Not to mention the nice protective rubber housing just adds to the quality of this product . A little bit of peace of mind in case you drop it or get liquid on it .  
1	  Are you kidding me ? I get a bag full of shredded paper and they 're flimsy already but then I go and pull them out and they get caught inside the machine and tear down the side , what 's the point ? I wish I could get my money back on these things because they are GOD AWFUL ! I now use Costco trash compacter bags that fit perfectly and don't tear when you pull them out , a little more expensive but worth it . Probably more plastic in ONE compacter bag than in 100 of these stupid bags .  
2	  I panicked when I needed a fan for my dell desk top . It 's an older model so I wasn't sure about being able to get the proper parts . But here it was ! I ordered it and had it within the week ! LOVE IT ! My computer works awesome again ! Thank you ! Genuine Dell CPU Case PC Fan 92mm OptiPlex  
1	  We got this CD player / radio for a wedding gift ( from our registry ) . The tuner doesn't get a lot of stations in our area ( we have tested this brand at circuit city since we got this one to see if it was just ours or if all of them were like that ) . Also , our tuning knob seems to be stuck , so we get ONE station really poorly . So , it has only been useful to us as a CD player so far , which really wasn't what we were looking for .  
2	  For the price , these speakers sound GREAT ! They have great bass and treble , and sound great even when you turn them up all the way . I may buy more and replace the rest of the speakers I have throughout my house . They were easy to install , and look great too !  
2	  First of all , I 'm not an audiophile or am not aware if I was one . However , I do listen to a wide variety of music including rock , pop , ( a lot of ) classical , hip hop , so I 'm your normal average Joe . And here 's my short take : Like what everyone 's been saying , the built quality and the sound quality are extremely good ! No complaint in these departments . I did take off one star because of the discomfort . I have average ( if not smaller than average ) head and ears , and these cans are just barely circumaural . The right cup barely fits comfortably over my ear , but the left one does not ( guess how I know my ears have slightly different sizes ? ) . So after about an hour of being pinched , my left ear would become red and irritated , and well , that can certainly distract me from enjoying music . I 'm hoping that after a while , they will loosen up a bit , but as I already have them for about 2 weeks , I don't think there 's much of that , so I 'm considering returning it for another different pair . I 'll give you an update later . To sum up , if you have larger than average ( I 'm curious to know that the official & # 34 ; average & # 34 ; ear size is ) , you will experience discomfort during and after use . I would suggest that you try them out in a store before buying them . I didn't do that and so regetting it .  
1	  While this is a good looking product it has a fatal design flaw . The edge of the light has a piece of plastic that is visible from the side . The problem is that even when the light is pointed down at the keyboard you 'll see the bright edge of the light and no matter how you position it the glare is bliding in low light situations ( which is the only time you need the damned thing ) . A piece of electric tape will solve the problem but I 'd suggest you look at another model .  
2	  I bought this product a while back and it has yet to dissapoint . Great value for your money , by the far the best and most resistent external hardrive . Once you get it , you won't need anything else .  
1	  I purchased the Z22 about a year ago after my Tungsten expired . I loved the Tungsten but decided to go with the Z22 in order to save a few dollars . Unfortunately , I was very disappointed with this decision . Reliability is a major concern ; the unit periodically stopped working properly . The screen would go blank for a few days and resetting the unit would not remedy the problem . Eventually , the problem would fix itself . Also , the touch screen failed to properly work . Finally , after less than a year , it stopped holding a charge . I just purchased a Tungsten E2 and could not be happier . Upgrade and go for the E2 .  
1	  I bought this to make an HTPC from a Zotac Ion motherboard / computer . It would bluescreen after a few minutes . I played with using one stick , changed the order , loaded several versions of operating system from Windows 7 to Vista to XP 32 bit and 64 . It would operate LONGER in safe mode , but still would BSOD ( blue screen ) Swapped with some older Corsair 1G sticks and works fine . It might be just a compatability . They are working fine in an Asus motherboard but I never was succesful using the 4 Gigs in the Zotac .  
1	  Less weight ! only 21g instead 25 grams compared to the Original Canon battery . Tested this battery many times , only 75 % of capacity , die quickly ! the battery is made in china said has 1400mah but much less than 1120mah ! Not happy with this battery from SterlingTEK on Canon S100 camera , only 40 minutes of video at most !  
1	  This is more of a NOTE to would-be buyers . I bought this due to all the good reviews and the description that it 's for Uniden cordless phones using model BT-446 battery . When battery arrived , it turns out this battery had a specific list of Uniden phones listed on its packaging . My Uniden cordless phone using BT-446 was NOT on the list ! Why that list is NOT part of the product description is anybody 's guess . Allowing MY stupidity to take over , I still tried to see if maybe it would still work on my phone . Bad move . It burned my phone in just a few minutes . Now I have one less phone . Again , that part is MY mistake . If Amazon still does not show a list of phones that this battery works with , just remember tocheck the packaging when you receive the battery and don't do as I did . Return it if your phone is not on the list .  
1	  I purchased this neoprene slip case to use for my 17 " notebook because I couldn't find any better ones . Though it fits , it 's not the greatest notebook case I 've had . So if you can find a better one , slightly higher in price , it might be worth it over this particular one .  
1	  Battery lasted maybe a week , wasn't new : package looked new , but scamed ! Try to stay away from 3 party vendors ..  
2	  Great frame . Easy installation of the Kodak Software . Nice outlook - not looking so plastic like the picture here . All options works fine . It recognized all networks around , and i didn't have any problems with setting up my local Wi-Fi . Then you can easily go online to the Kodak EasyShare page and all albums you have there can be previewed on the frame . Otherwise it has internal memory , which is not enough for anything except the initial tests , but all memory cards i used was working fine . The only one " problem " is that the slideshow is really slow , but it 's not so embarrasing . Good choice for everyone .  
1	  I bought this drive myself , because the space I was using on my laptop ( 20GB at the time ) wasn't enough . I needed to archive some things to make way for new . At the time , the laptop I had did not support USB 2.0 , but it did have Firewire . Wanting to make sure it was as fast as possible , this was the cheapest method to accomplishing what I wanted to do . Unfortunately , the saying that & quot ; you get what you pay for & quot ; has never been more true . As a drive ? IT 's great . It 's fast , efficient , great storage for the price . AS a product ? It sucks . Like many others , mine started making the loud noise too , and the only way to get it to stop is to bang it . Not very comfortable with continual banging of a storage device . A lot of my information has sensitive parts , so I can't send it to the shop to repair it under warranty , because of privacy laws . I bought another drive , a US Logic with less space and no Firewire ( I have a better laptop now that supports USB 2.0 ) , and it 's not as fast as the other , but it does what I need to , and quietly . If you need external memory ? Don't buy ACOMData products .  
2	  Doesn't have the option of a Large capacity cartridge .. but easy to install and prints quite well for a single cartridge / multi-colour set-up .  
2	  I have tried the knockoff version of this and it wasn't worth the money at all . The fake ones tend to break or really not fire when you need them to . I ordered this one and it worked like a charm . Every time I pushed the button it fires without issue . It could be a little longer but I still love it . Don't waste your time with the fake versions of this product . If you 've spent the money on a good camera then don't take the chance of missing the shot .  
2	  Truly superb sound . I 've retired my CD player in favor of downloading songs from itunes .  
1	  It 's been 6 weeks since I ordered this product and I have still not received it yet . Because I live in Hawaii purchases take longer to make it here , but I wouldn't have order this item if I knew it was going to be shipped by slow boat from the East Coast .  
2	  For ( .. ) bucks there is simply no way you will do better than this . After reading a review in Maximum PC I decided to give them a try despite hearing many horrible labtec speakers in the past . You cannot spend less than ( high price ) and come away with a better 3-piece speaker setup than this . Because of the price and great quality , I 'm even thinking of buying another set and hooking up a 4.2 ( 4 sats 2 subs ) setup .. Amazing subwoofer , great satellites , even more amazing price . Buy these now .  
2	  If you listen to music a lot and care enough about sound quality that you rip your CDs at a higher bitrate than most MP3s ( or you rip to FLAC or similar lossless ) , you 'll get a lot out of these affordable , well-made , low profile headphones . They fit well , are easily adjustable ( they have a nice touch where the posts that connect the cans to the head band are free to rotate and slide up and down , making getting the fit right a no-fuss affair ) , and most importantly , they sound great . The best way I can describe it is you will notice better " spatial " separation with the instruments and voices in the music - it 's much easier to hear the sometimes too subtle for earbuds sounds , like a high hat or a little down in the mix flourish from a keyboard - something that previously was lost in the noise but now cuts through clearly . It makes a big difference . I also like that they are hand-made in the U.S. , and feel pretty solidly built . You won't be disappointed with these , unless perhaps you are one of those guys who claims he can tell the difference in sound quality between different grades of speaker wire ( puh-leeze , spare me ) .  
2	  It plays as it should . My old Sony of many years finally , " let-go . " I was prepared to buy another Sony Carousel but was put off by several consumer reviews . Two of the reviews touted this Onkyo and I followed suit . So far , It 's performed quite well but I have yet to put it through all of it 's features . This unit is to be recommended .  
2	  Excellent , strong and light weight tripod for the average enthusiast using heavy lens / camera combinations . Easy to set up and take down . Good quality for Amazon 's reasonable price .  
1	  This Sony NPFF71 battery is giving very low backup time . I am getting only 45 minutes of video recording time on my DCR PC108E Handycam . This is a 1560mAh battery . It should give 3 to 4 hours of video recording time .  
1	  We purchased and set up this system 1/3/06 . It is sleek and the sound was fantastic . However 31 days later the subwoofer fan began making an awful noise . The warranty choices were send it to N.J. or drive it 100 miles round trip for repair . We drove it 100 miles for repair . After 20 days they advised they couldn't fix it even after installing a new fan . Another 100 mile round trip to pick it up . On 3/2/06 we shipped the subwoofer to N.J. and got it back on 4/5/06 . By 6/12/06 the subwoofer fan had stopped intermittantly many times and with it all sound from the speakers . We again drove 100 miles and returned the whole home theater system for credit .  
1	  Just received the response shown below after me second email to Canon regarding my S400 . It seems familiar - exact wording that I saw on another website claiming ignorance about a problem . I have now filed a complaint with the California and New York Attorney General 's Office and the New York BB . I strongly suggest all of you with this problem to do likewise so we can build a fire under Canon . If your camera has this problem and you haven't yet posted to this site let us hear from you . We should also start posting to other shopping websites ( dealcatcher , epinions , etc ) as well as the photography sites , including their Letters to the Editor . We need to make others aware of the way Canon has turned this problem into a profit center . - Thank you for contacting Canon product support . We value you as a Canon customer and appreciate the opportunity to assist you . Please note , Canon USA does not monitor , confirm , endorse , or attest to the accuracy of any information posted on third party websites . It seems many customers are overwhelmed by the barrage of information ( or misinformation ) being posted on unregulated , non-Canon websites . Unfortunately , this is not something over which Canon has any control . We are able only to confirm the performance of the camera based on ourown testing .

2	  This was a gift for my niece when she was 18 years old . She said to me that it was a very nice gift .  
2	  This lens works just as expected . Easy to use and contributes to some very high quality photos . Check out $U$ to see some photos .  
1	  It was not mentioned before hand that this item does not work with windows vista , i guess that is why it is so much less expensive . It is useless to me now since all my PCs are on vista . Thank you so much for the lack of infomation . signed NOT PLEASED  
1	  I bought a MySky in February . When it arrived , from the first time , it woudld not work : It would lock up whether you had it look for birds or you entered data manually . I sent it back . Waited weeks . Got replacement . It worked once . Next time , buttons failed to work and parts falling out of battery door . I sent it back again , had to pay this time because I had it more than 2 months ( never really got to use it , it was cloudy during the midwest floods ! ) still have not heard or seen any sign of a replacement after a long wait . Do the magazine reviewers get special units ? Checking online I see that nearly everyone here as well as on other forums has been unable to get a reliably working unit .  
1	  .. and if you used this alarm clock you most likely slept through it ( recorded history ) . It has a " volume " feature where 0 has no sound and 1-14 all sound pretty much the same in volume . I have never been so let down by anything other than Starwars Episode one .. but it would be a close tie . It is very random on deciding when and if to allow Ipod control via its buttons , its alarm just decided it would work when and if it wanted to .. and it has kept time worse than any other clock I have ever had . I am not sure if I could ever trust Ihome again because this is a horrid horrid horrid clock .  
1	  It 's the MOST TOXIC-SMELLY product I have ever received in my life . The toxic and chemical smell is so horrible that it smells DEADLY , yes , it feels that it could kill you or others if you smell it over an extended period of time . The smell is first felt after opening the package , and after careful inspection , I think the smell is from the plastic part of the lock , including the handle of the keys . I guess the manufacturer wants to save cost at any costs , so it uses some poorly recycled and toxic plastic ? The worse thing is that the smell is so strong , it actually spreads through the whole house ! I immediately threw it away , and then spent sometime to pack it in a plastic bag . Otherwise , it would contaminate my bathroom . One day later , I filed a return , but apparently I need to pay $ 5 + shipping in order to get only one cent back . This makes it nonreturnable because I 'll pay more to get less money back . I suspect that the seller already knows that the product is defective due to its smell , so it sells it dirt cheap just to get rid of the product ! The seller is very unethical ! These locks should be all thrown away , not resold again !  
1	  .. I had a pair that I bought out of desperation ( a quick fix ) once and consider them to be the worst of the many different ear buds I 've gone through throughout the years . Tinny , with very little range or bass I refused to use them after one time . The absolute worst . If you ever think about buying these elsewhere don't bother . They are .. not worth the material they are made of . They are really bad .  
1	  Energizer should be ashamed to put their name on this useless piece of junk . I bought this laptop battery from Circuit City and 2 months later it could not hold a charge . When I attempted to contact Technuity or Batteries . com ( or whatever the fly-by-night company that produces this battery is called ) they informed me that I would have to ship the battery back to them in Indianapolis and include a check for $ 5.45 . When I questioned them about " FREE " replacement they just laughed . When I inquired about this business practice , they just told me to read the fine-print of the warranty . So , my recommendation is .. unless you enjoy damaging your laptop and spending money for a useless piece of plastic , stay away from this battery . Buy the Sony brand and pay the extra money .. atleast Sony will be more professional when responding to your concerns . Finally .. Note to Energizer - Cut these guys from your product line , you have already pushed me to only buy Duracell products from this day forward .  
2	  great experience with Amazon and JW Music . Delivery was problem free and on time .  
2	  I 've been an audiophile since the late 50s , I own three HOME THEATER systems , one built using a pair of 168 pound Klipschorns , arguably one of the best speakers ever built ( currently $ 8000 per pair ) . I don't know how I missed these headphones from Koss one of the early developers ( over 50 years ago ) of headphones with the Portapro design over 25 years old . Paul Klipsch and John Koss were from the golden age of audio . I 've owned a number of headphones from Koss , from Bose ( the leader in noise canceling designs ) and have listened to many different headphones in all price ranges and owned headphones costing over $ 300 . These are the best I 've ever heard ! And they only cost about $ 30 bucks1How is this possible ? Well I think I know . In speaker design , accurate bass reproduction is the most challenging . Accurate is the key word ; loud booming bass isn't all that hard . It used to be called " juke box boom " . It 's now a fad in " boom boxes " and butt kicking car boxes . Some people think it 's the end all and be all . Actually it 's loud distortion that muddies and distorts other frequencies . Accurate music sounds real not hyped ( although some rock concerts are super = hyped and that 's what 's real to some ; and that 's OK if that 's what you like ) . True high definition sound reproduction , however is crisp clean and well defined . You can hear the sound of the sticks hitting the skin of the drums , the bass fiddle strings being plucked and you can distinguish and locate one instrument from others in the band or orchestra . Bass frequencies are big powerful wave forms that can obscure other frequencies and can cancel and distort themselves . There are three basic speaker designs that try to prevent this . The waves from the back of bass speakers can easily cancel the waves from the front of bass speakers because they are out of phase with each other and are extremely hard to dampen because of their powerful and long wavelengths . Bass reflex speaker enclosures attempt to turn the waves produced by the back of speakers around to be in phase and augment rather than cancel the waves emanating from the front of the speaker . However , to do this with great clarity at very low frequencies in a bass reflex design requires a very long folded horn design ( think bass tuba ) . Klipshorns use the walls of a room and must be placed in corners . They also require very substantial and heavy enclosures that won't vibrate ! Higher frequencies need much smaller horns and are far easier to design without canceling frequencies and to prevent vibrations . Thus " tweeters " are very small next to " woofers " . Bass relex and folded horn enclosures are efficiency champs and can produce high sound levels at very low power . They are the speakers used in big old movie theaters . Another design is the " acoustic suspension " speaker that attempt to absorb and eliminate the back waves by stuffing a smaller but very sturdy enclosure with a lot of absorbent material . This is harder to accomplish than with the bass reflex design but results in much smaller enclosures that are very inefficient and require high powered amps . But that can be placed in bookshelves rather than stand in corners and be the size of refrigerators ! Both of these designs have real problems when used in headphones . The third speaker enclosure design is seldom seen anymore . It 's called the " infinite baffle " - it takes the out of phase waves from the back of the speaker and vents it to the great outdoors or the inside of a big closet filled with a lot of clothes ! The Portapros are basically an " infinite baffle " design - the least distorted of the 3 designs ! While an infinite baffle design may cause your neighbors or whoever wants to use or lives on the other-side of your closet to purchase a shotgun , headphone speakers use very tiny speakers that are coupled directly to your eardrums ( yes they can damage your eardrums or produce tinnitus at high volumes ) but produce relatively low levels of sound at even short distances outside of your ears . Noise canceling headphones use electronics to cancel outside noise by setting up an out-of-phase signal . Wear them in a buzy city and risk being run over by a honking truck ! However any sealed enclosure around your ear creates distortion not found in an infinite baffle design . Its really difficult and costly to eliminate distortion with designs that are not infinite baffles . Thus , the very low distortion crystal clear high definition non-noise canceling sound " leaking " marvelous and cheap Portapros ! Ecstasy , if you love quality sound reproduction . And yes they are now available in a new design , almost completely black - blue inserts and silver headband included - and more importantly with sturdier cloth covered wires .  
1	  I didn't like this product much . This product doesn't have good bass and not conformtable as well . Hence decided to return this product and go for different one .  
1	  great price but u get what your paid , it only last 6 months and then is dead , company support do not respondits a disposable stereo  
1	  Do not put your laptop on this product without a good gripper pad under it to hold it in place ! I LOVED it for the 20 minutes I got to use it . BUT with my 15 " laptop it was top heavy and unstable . The bottom was too smooth on my smooth tabletop . It was bigger than I thought and the edge was just over the edge of my laptop table . A little jiggle and the whole thing slid , then fell over ! SCREAM ! My laptop is DEAD and being shipped off for a new hard drive . SCREAM !  
1	  I tested these units at a group shoot and had multiple problems with the unit inconsistently maintaining contact with the camera 's hotshoe . I tried 3 different models of Canon bodies . Another photographer tried them on his Nikon bodies and had the same problem . The owner of the units said he has the same problem and used gaffer 's tape to reduce the problem . Even with the gaffer tape , failure was about 25 % of the time . By adjusting how I held my camera and placing my thumb on the unit providing preasure to maintain the contact , the unit functioned normally about 85 % of the time . We had ten different photographers use the unit and all had the same problem .  
1	  How could I give you my opinion on the product that I have not received ?  
1	  I bought this in early 2003 . DVD drawer will only open with the remote . Now half of the remote functions won't work and there is no other way to access things . My center speaker stopped working ( no dialogue ) . It is not the speaker . But the remote won't work when I try to change the mode to a different output . So is now useless .  
1	  I have one of these drives and use it to free up some of my hard drive space . I truely am amazed at the ability and capacity of the Clik Drive . The only problem is .. you can buy a new drive at about the same price as the used drive is listed at . All the same features and a whole lot cheaper . Just look around a little more for it else where .  
1	  I am not happy with this product . It does a marginal job humidifying a room . In fact , you need to have it on the high setting to get any affect . The problem is that the motor is very noisy at that setting .  
1	  I received mine for christmas and it is awful . It did not come with a disc and I have windows vista which has been nothing but a nightmare . I hate it and would never ever recommend this product to anyone . I wish I had never received it . It is the worst thing I have ever had to work with . This Coby product is awful and I am putting the word out about this product , please do not waste your money on this product because this is a piece of junk !  
2	  I won't go on and on like the other reviews because I 'd just be repeating the same information . I print alot for biz purposes and have found this to be a great printer for my needs . The price was really right , I could not find one at any retail places ( even on sale ) for less than $ 50 + more plus gas . Free shipping was a nice perk , and I had my new printer in less than a week not counting the weekend . No tax ? COOL ! I 'm not a " techno " person and I find it easy to operate . In fact it does so much more than my last printer I 'm amazed . The quality of the prints is excellent , fast printing ( for large quantities this is nice ) , and quiet operation in comparison to my old one which use to terrify my cats . I haven't quite figured out the fax , but then I haven't taken the time to do so either ( I work alot of hours ) . I got a Canon camera for Xmas , and feel that this printer was a good choice as a compatible piece of equip . for photos . My other printer was a real pill in getting it to work properly in this way . Anyhow , I read the reviews here before I purchased and had the thing up and running in about an hour . Like I said , I 'm not mechanically inclined so I am very happy . I find that the positive reviews here are accurate . I 'm stickin ' with Canon .  
1	  Despite the description stating its for 96-02 Cadillacs , it does not work with my 97 Seville . After I started to assemble the wiring , I happened to notice that on the package , it did not note it was compatible with my car . Being the optimistic guy that I try to be , I still wired everything together only to notice that sound only came out of my front driver door . I did some research on this , and on my car . It turns out , that my car has an amp for the speakers , which this harness did not support .  
1	  Sure , buy this printer , if you want to spend hours and dollar $ to get the quality of prints from your digital camera that almost match the quality of prints from [ a ] one-time use Kodak camera available at any grocery store . And don't expect to use it with your computer - the only use for this printer is to plug in a memory card , print an index sheet , and then print those expen$ive sheets . Don't waste your time or money .  
2	  I know this bag has gotten some bad reviews . If you need a bag to carry your Wacom tablet solo , with a handle and all , then this is not the bag you need . I wanted a thin sleeve to protect my tablet so I could put it safely in my laptop bag , or store it outside . Its not going to hold the mouse , but for me , I knew that was going into my laptop bag . It didn't give the last star because there is a pocket on the inside of the bag that i think is a bit on the low quality side , but the rest is pretty solid . My recommendation would be to evaluate what you need in a bag . If you just need a lightweight protection for your tablet , then this works . If not , then look elsewhere ! Simple ! :)  
1	  Earlier i ordered same product around in the end of March .. To my surprise the quality of that cable was so good .. so i again ordered same product for my friend .. and to my surprise this time cable shipped to me was really thin in terms of thickness .. also the Video Result was not good .. compared to the same cable I purchased earlier .. don't understand .. what happened ? Same Cable Brand .. but different products at two different times .. !  
1	  Before I purchased the Panasonic P7105 printer I reviewed Small Office Home Office ( SOHO ) printers made by Samsung , Hewlett Packard , Minolta , and Brother . My goal was to spend no more than $ 230 . Though the printers in this category offered decent print quality there was one option they did not have and that was automatic duplex printing . The most affordable printer that offered this feature was the P7105 , so I increased my spending limit accordingly . I was also pleased that the printer came with 16MB of RAM and the company offered a $ 20 ( 2000 page ) toner refill kit . Affordable printers often make up the difference in original savings by killing you with higher prices on the consumables such as the drum and toner . The printer did not set up very easily and I eventually went to their web site and downloaded the latest drivers . Once I was able to print I was very disappointed in the print quality . Even after ensuring that the toner save mode was off and the print quality was set to its highest setting , the print just seemed too gray and this was using 99 + bright white paper . The printer was noisy and the duplex feature was not smooth at all . The printer also had a memory problem and the uninstall did not work . When I called tech support they sent me to the Japanese web site to download a special uninstall program ( which also crashed ) . The Tech also told me if the uninstall program did not work then to call back and be prepared to spend an hour on the phone cleaning up my system ( their tech support is non toll free , so to fix their defective product you have to use your phone bill ) . They eventually told me to return the system . Even if I overlooked the memory problem , the printer was still of very poor quality . It felt cheap and flimsy . Since I could not find a local dealer who sold one , I brought it off the Internet site unseen . If you are considering this printer I would highly recommend trying to find one local so that you can see first hand the quality or lack there of . I eventually spent an additional $ 50 and purchased a Brother 1650 and the difference is day and night . If auto duplexing is not important then there are some good buys for under $ 200 . If you need the duplexing feature then I would highly recommend the Brother 1650 .  
2	  Just received my microwave popcorn popper last weekend and wanted to chime in - albeit early - on what I 've found so far . Of the 4 or so batches I 've made , it takes about 2 minutes , 30 seconds in MY microwave ( YMMV ) . I 'm not sure I understand , like , or care for the little paper " concentrator " thingies , because I believe a product like this should NOT come with disposable ( and required to replace ) parts , but so far , it cooks 99 % of the kernels I put in it , and the popcorn comes out great ( for a non-oil type popper ) . I 'm trying to be a little healthier , so I don't use oil . I also have the other type of air popper which is basically like putting kernels into a hair dryer , but with this microwave popper , because of the steaming aspect of the bowl itself , the resulting popcorn isn't dry and so far , at 2.5 minutes , hasn't scorched . Also , unlike the " hair dryer " style air popper , unpopped kernels don't fly all over the kitchen . In short , aside from having to occassionally replace the " concentrator " paper parts which irks me , the Presto PowerPop Microwave Popper does exactly what it says and considering there 's only one bowl to clean ( the popper itself ) , I like it ..  
2	  Perfect for the person who needs 2 batteries charged . Only thing i see that some may not like is the batteries charge one at a time . But if you just want the luxury of not having to worry about changing batteries after one is charged , this is what you want .  
1	  I absolutely positively do NOT recommend this device . The on-screen interface is difficult to understand . The randomizer function limits itself by sections of the alphabet ( if you select to play all songs randomly , it will only play tracks from the first few letters of the alphabet and never get to the latter half ) . The interface software you are required to use is clunky and nearly useless - it is only marginally better for creating playlists than the terrible device UI , and there is no synchronization between your device and your music folders . Perhaps most shocking - and this should have warned me about this player the moment I got it - is that selecting " power off " brings up a small screen that says " Bye Bye ! " with an anime emoticon , of all things . All of this could be tolerated if not for one major problem . Despite the device having a whopping amount of storage for a small amount of money , it is 100 % not supported by ANY entity . [ .. ] I thought that since Polaroid partnered with Digital Media Group , having their name on the product meant they would support it in some way - no dice . The representatives on the phone insisted that I call 1-800-MP3-PLAY ( it took a long time before I finally convinced them that they had the wrong number ) and that they couldn't help me . I finally resorted to contacting the person who sold this to me , who did some research and found that Digital Media Group had been sold , and the new company refused to support these devices . In summary , do not buy ANY " Polaroid MP3 " product . They are completely unsupported and not user-friendly .  
1	  They sent me a kodak camera battery , aside from that I gave them one star because it got to my house on time .  
1	  I 'm sorry to post that I never liked this camera and it 's always a toss up as to whether I 'm going to get a clear photo , especially outdoors . I can take 50 landscape photos and half of them will be blurry and I 've tried everything . Now I 've been getting the ' lens error ' where the lens won't go in , won't go out and I 've missed so many shots fiddling with this . I 'm real disappointed in this camera and I 've had less pixels and a lower priced camera that performed better . I 'm looking for a new camera in the same price range and may go back to the brand I used before that never let me down .  
1	  My usb port was about 1.5 feet from the mouse and the mouse still did not pick up the signal . Tried it out with 2 sets of mice and the same results . Went back to Best Buy and got a logitech ( V200 ) that worked right out of the box  
2	  I was very lucky to get this mouse - used - from an Amazon vendor about 2000 miles from my home . I paid roughly $ 25 for it . The mouse is excellent . It has the ability to go from page to page in an enormous document ( enormous : almost 2,000 pages ) very very fast . There is an adjustment on the bottom of the mouse which influences the speed of this . It is comfortable . Sensitive and smooth . On the downside , the installation of the software ( downloaded directly from Logitech ) took a long time and tried my patience . However , once running , it offers excellent choices for button commands . If you have a desktop arrangement for your computer , consider the practicality of getting a cordless mouse with a corded keyboard . For details on that , please see my review of the Logitech " Wave " keyboard .  
2	  A great use for storing important files and other types of media . 60GB is a lot of space .  
1	  I sent it back . I bought it because of good reviews . My advice . Don't buy it .  
1	  The Panasonic RF-SW70 has a lot of bells and whistles , but the sound quality is about a " C " with the bass turned on , and unpleasantly tinny with the bass turned off . The plastic earphones were uncomfortable and kept popping out of my ears . There 's an annoying beep every time one changes the station . Of all the portable walkabout radios I 've tried , this was the least intuitive / most complicated to use . I had to sit down with the instructions to figure out how to use the bass function . I worked with the instructions for 10 or 15 minutes to try to pre-set some favorite stations , and was still unable to figure out how to do this . Likewise the lap timer was confusing . It 's a stop watch one can have beep every 1 , 5 , or 10 minutes , but I wasn't clear on how to work it . Many people will not need this feature . There 's also a " city function " to receive better reception on FM broadcasts from weaker stations . Ironically , I was able to pull in these stations only when this function was turned off . Other features include :* a secure belt clip * tapered shape for holding in the palm of the hand * light-weight ( 3.6 ounces including headphones ) Overall I was not terribly impressed . With mediocre sound quality and confusing functions , I find other radios to be better buys .  
2	  it works fine , and the price is right . I 've used the car charger and the wall wart and both are fine . The cable is a bit short but it works . If I ever need another I 'm coming back here to order it .  
1	  i recieved this product about a few weeks ago , hooked to my ipod and got barely an audible from it , checked everthing to make sure i was hooking my ipod up properly same response . i will not recoomend this product to anyone else .  
2	  This was my first GPS and overall I am very happy with the Nuvi 360 . I do have two small complaints : 1 . The volume is not loud enough to here clearly over the engine and road noise . 2 . The screen is not bright enough in bright sunlight .  
1	  This TV looks great on all of the high definition channels . However , it will give you a headache watching all of the other channels . I decided to return the TV after 1 week of having it , and found out that Amazon will not accept returns on TV 's under any condition when larger than 27 in . Sony will not make good on the return either . Read the Amazon fine print carefully , and make sure you look at this TV on an Analog and / or Digital channel ( the vast majority of cable channels ) in the store prior to commiting to its purchase . I 'm stuck !  
2	  I have a Kodak EasyShare and this camera . I really love this camera . The smaller size is a real bonus and photo quality is fine for a casual photographer .  
1	  I bought several of this items as a gift . Stay away if you want them for yourself .  
2	  This UPS is sturdy , heavy , and no-frills . It works the way that I would expect it to . I would recommend this product to others .  
2	  I have owned my new Macbook Pro for two months now .. I always had Dell ( four of them ) I find the Mac faster and it has much clearer grahics and lots of features which I am still learning .. I am very pleased with the purchase and recommend it if you can afford the extra money .  
2	  The Garmin n & uuml ; vi 360 is an excellent product . I used to have a StreetPilot C330 and upgraded to this one , so i 'm not new when it comes to Garmin GPS navigator . Pros : Excellent software and features , usability and design . Cons : Low speaker volume on Text-to-speech voices .  
1	  I expected an external drive and it is an internal drive . It will cost me a fortune to get it installed , so I won't use it .  
1	  Mine was good for about the first two months . Then for some reason card stopped working at all . I 've worked with these things enough to know how to use them . My 8gb Transcend card fails .  
1	  Printed documents are not evenly colored . I did clearn up the cartridge again and again using the " clean up " command for my printer , but it didn't solve the problem at all .  
1	  Product does not last time stated 8.6 hours . I Charged both batteries per instructions on package after each use . Actual battery time was 60min recording time or less than the tape . Very unhappy with sellers service . Gave me the run around about order I returned and never answer phone but one time . Package states warranty . Calls back on different phone to tell me check warehouse . Called phone number listed and listen to a automated phone service any options selected returns to sales voice mail . Emailed many times and received automated response .  
2	  I bought the box to use for my portfolio case . Had matboard cut to size and then used photo corners to mount my presentation pieces . It 's nice size , and fits perfectly in my carryon luggage . My only problem with this order was that the shipping was late and it took a few phone calls to Calumet before they resolved this problem . I 'd still order from them again , though , the product is that good .  
1	  These headphones sound WORSE than the one 's that came with my Ipod touch . There is no low frequency response . Turn the volume up and you have piercing high frequency only . I regret purchasing these headphones  
1	  I was very disappointed with the whole experience . Firstly , the machine never worked and also the accompanying directions and brochure was most inadequate and very poorly written . Furthermore , it took great effort and persistence to finally return the songwriter for another machine . I hope my next experience is not as trying !  
1	  After one year using in my home the internal system pull-down was broken . Its a poor little plastic piece less than $ 1.00 value . If you contact ELITE screen manufacture they ask you have to buy a new one because they don ` t sell the plastic piece . Really a poor product , poor after sale attention . After all for a $ 100.00 price cost What we can receive ?  
1	  Just had to stop installation with boxes all around the room and no TV to watch because this stupid company doesn't have a note in any of their sales literature and doesn't include a needed adapter kit ( 4 inserts ) to allow mount with 8M screws - I have a Samsung LED and it requires 8M mounting threads . Instead of just including the inserts - probably a bucks worth - they printed a page in the manual to tell you not to return product to store and a number to call to get the inserts - I called and they said to call back Monday - Friday to tech support . I will never use an omnimount again so rating should be ZERO .  
2	  I got these fans to change out the blue LED fans that came with my antec900 case . It is now all red LED 's and it looks the same just red now . I recommend this fan if you want Red LED 's . Also i have own these fans ( three ) for over a year and none of them have any noise issues at all .  
2	  I have had this computer for almost 2 years and have not had a major problem . After having it 4 months , however , I could not take the slowness anymore . So I decided to upgrade the Ram memory from 512 to 2G . It was so worth it . Anyone considering purchasing this product should definitely upgrade the memory . I purchased 2G of memory for about 40 dollars . You may be able to find it cheaper . And the installation of the memory was simple . You just have to unscrew the back and pop of the little memory door and insert the new memory into the computer . I would suggest this computer for anyone . It is very reliable .  
1	  I purchased this headset less than a month ago . I use it to Skype for work . The sound quality was good while it lasted . It seems to no longer work . I can still hear the other people on the call , but no one can hear me . We 've run tons of diagnostics and tried it on different computers but it is not functioning anymore . I 'm going to try to get a refund . I 'm really disappointed !  
2	  I got this for a great price and have had it for about four years now and it still works great . Lots of memory .  
2	  This is a fantastic device that any small business owner or home owner should install in conjunction with a good UPS . Even if your UPS says it has power conditioning get this . It will do a much better job and the part that actually bleeds off spikes in power will last longer . The ones in your typical store bought , or even nice UPS , units will wear out in a year or so depending on your situation and you will never know that your device is getting constant fluctuations . This is what kills and or causes people to replace electronics all the time . They almost always think they have bad electronics when in fact they just have bad maintenance habits caused by simple ignorance of the problems you must address in regards to your home / business power supply . If you have power that fluctuates in your environs you are literally cutting the life of your computers , televisions and more in half or worse . With computers many of the problems you see in regards to slowing down and constant little hardware failures ( Hard Drives being a big one ) are caused by this . Buy one of these and a good UPS for your new big screen and you will have it for 8 years instead of 4 before it needs replacing . That kind of savings right there would buy you enough of these to protect all your electronics . However there seem to be some who do not understand what this is and think it will also apply power to your line .. It will not provide your device with additional power when a device peals off a large spike in current . It will just protect the device from the harm that can be caused by the irregular voltage that happens with such an occurrence . When you see that pull that lowers the power through out your home you may not notice the large spike and extreme lows and spikes that occur through out the event . This protects you from that . If you want to insure compensating power is provided you need to add a UPS as well . Hope this helps .. Keep this device because it will save your electronics since you obviously need to increase the capacity of the feed and wiring in your home . I just moved into an old home last year that had the most cobbled together electrical system I had ever seen . I was told that is pretty normal in the old days . I have a huge number of very valuable electronics so I paid $ 8,000 to have new mains brought to the house and isolated new circuits through out the house where ever electronics would go . Even then I had brown outs when my A / C cut on . I had a house surge protector installed at the circuit box , a special power compensation unit added to the A / C and have put these devices and APC 1500 UPS 's through out the house to guarantee smooth power no matter the problem . It may seem extreme but compared to replacing equipment or God forbid making a claim that would cost me several times that improvement cost in increased premiums . Pay the money and do it right or regret it later . This is one of those situation where it is not a matter of " If " . It is a matter of " It is happening right now as you read this review " . Buy it now . It is cheaper than a night at the movies for the family . Jeff  
1	  I sure wish I had read these reviews before I bought this printer . I know for a fact that every time it sounds like it 's charging or whatever , it is spilling ink onto that pad that 's inside . I had to quit using it because it had about a 1 inch black wet line running down the page , the paper would fall apart it was so wet . Then I would tell it to print like 3 pages and the black wet line faded some , but it was still huge and dark and unusable , then when it finished printing the 3 pages it would do it 's little charge thing ( aka drinking ink ) then the first page I would print would have this sopping wet 1-inch line going down the middle . On top of that , Canon told me all I had to do was take it into their nearest shop and they would put a printhead in for me . Well , I 've done that before on a previous Canon printer . This place is 100 miles from my house , one way ! I had to take it up there and they refused to even mail it back to me . I told the tech if all it needed was a printhead then I 'll buy a new printhead and put it in myself . Ok , I spent $ 75.00 on a printhead and it didn't make a bit of difference and I couldn't return it , because I had opened the box ! ( anybody want to buy a cheap printhead ? ) So then I thought instead of chunking it I would use it as a scanner or fax machine , HA that was a joke too , when the ink ran out ( mysteriously evaporated , cause I wasn't printing anything ) , it locked up the whole machine ! I tried to fool the thing by filling an ink tank with water , that didn't work . So since I had 5 unused Canon ink cartridges on hand ( all black ) I opened all of those brand new expensive ink cartridges and put them in and this thing KNEW they were not the right colors and it continues to be locked up . Another thing , don't think you can try generic ink cartridges either , it knows they are generic and won't print ! I 've had it , now it 's going to the garbage dump . I 'll never buy another Canon , 1st time shame on Canon , 2nd time shame on me ! :(  
1	  First the picture indicates the lid and the gray bottom are connected " hinged " together . Nope - 2 separate pieces . It barely stays together - the slightest bump and the clear lid slides off - heat escapes - wasted energy . Second , the giant 1970 's bobby-pin shaped clips are a joke - good luck getting them to hold the curler and your hair long enough to curl - plan on buying clam-shaped plastic clips and third , the curlers are not covered in any way to protect hair from direct heat . This set will not " travel " ! This wasted time-convenient purchase buys me time to shop for a GOOD curler set . Hello - Revlon - it is time to utilize current , energy efficient and healthy technology ! It IS the 21st century , ya know ?  
2	  I had my doubts when I first bought one of these . But now I am hooked and have bought several to give away as present to friends and family who own laptops and it makes a huge difference . No more overheating ! Absolutely worth it !  
1	  This device is not properly grounded . It is not floating and it is not tied to earth ground . Instead , both the case screws and negative terminal are + 22V referenced to earth ground . Connecting an oscilloscope ground clip to the negative terminal was enough to create a big spark and fry some components . Thankfully , Amazon was accepting of the return and I got the HY3005D instead . The HY3005D , though probably made by the same company , is able to be connected to earth ground without causing a short .  
2	  I upgraded from a 10/100 switch to this D-Link DGS-2208 about a month ago and I love it ! Moving DVD ISO images from one computer to another is now much faster ( of course , both computers have gigabit nics ) . The switch was always the choke point in the process but not any more .  
1	  Used about 3 or 4 times , and sound now only comes out of one ear . Too much hassle to return .  
1	  I have had this player a little over two months and I have some very dissappointing and disconcerting news for my fellow consumers . First , I bought this on impluse and now I 'm reaping a bitter harvest because my Rio Nitrus is basically an mp3 zombie , allow me to expain . I bought it remanufactured off of Overstock for about $ 75.00 ( msrp >$ 150 ) and had misgivings from the start ; impulse purchases tend to be ones you regret and this was out of character for me , I even considered sending it back without opening the shipping packaging but when it arrived curiosity got the better of me .. damn ! Well surprise , when I opened it I found it in pristine condition and it did not appear to have ever been owned before , and I really scrutinized the whole package , it really looked perfect . ( If I may back-track for a moment . After my orignal order I went immediately to Amazon to check-out consumer reviews and I was rattled , lots of negative comments and pretty unanimous . So when I got it I really , as I 've said , wanted to send it back but .. . Anyway , I gave it a shot and boy am I sorry . ) After a very short time the player would start-up and then shut itself off ( while trying to listen to music ) at random intervals and then sometimes on again .. and then off again and on .. etc . I 'm sure you get the idea ! Then just the other day I went to delete some old songs and download some new ones and my OS kept crashing and continues to do so to this very day . Yes I tried the firmware updates and all other applicable software fixes , they were totally useless and I even reset the player .. worthless . So , in review , I cannot delete old or import new files , my player turns off / on at random intervals with increasing regularity with each passing day so the handwriting is on the wall , my player is on its way out , eg . zombie mp3 ! Finally , what I believe to be a trace of irony . Seems like once you have one of these infernal gagets it 's hard get on withoutone so i 'm shopping again and now that I 've got religion i 'm doing the requisite research . Turns out all these gagets ( drive or flash ) log the same or similar complaints regardless of price if they have been owned for any modest period of time and owned by any number of consumers . Bottom line .. the man is sticking it to you , good luck . As for me I will play mine till it dies and then I will toss it into the GOM just as far as I can ! PS . I thought I read or heard somewhere this company is ethier folding or getting out of the digital music player biz . Have a nice day !  
1	  EPSON PERFECTION V700 SCANNER - FAR FROM PERFECTIONI have owned , loved and recommended Epson products since the 1980 's . The quality was always great , as was their technical support , customer service and customer satisfaction . Because of this , I have owned ONLY Epson photo printers and scanners . I do own another brand laser printer , a Brother , I love it . I have actually intervened in a sale at Best Buy where the salesperson was pushing an HP photo printer on a customer and told them to buy Epson , as there was no comparison in the quality of the print , the product and the support . The customer ended up walking out of the store with the Epson printer . My satisfaction with Epson came to a halt the other day when I experienced a problem with my still under warranty Epson V700 scanner . I scanned approximately25 photos and the carriage stopped moving , red light flashed and it was dead . I called tech support , they kept asking me the same stupid questions over and over , and finally decided I had a hardware failure and the unit needed to be serviced . They referred me to an authorized Epson repair service in my state , and told me to contact them to have the unit repaired . I asked about shipping , they said that Epson would take care of it . The next morning I called the authorized repair service , no answer , left messages , no calls back . Called about 50 times , only got voice mail . Finally I got someone on the phone who told me that I must ship the unit to them by FedEx or UPS for repair . I called Epson 's tech support again , and they told me they will not pay the frieght , that would be on me , even though the unit was still under warranty . I checked the cost to ship with insurance , about $ 50.00 each way . Needless to say , I am not a happy camper , either with the performance of the scanner or the fact that I have to shell out another $ 100.00 for a scanner that was obviously defective out of the box . I will not purchase an Epson product again , nor will I ever recommend their products to friends , colleagues , family or strangers at Best Buy . Too bad Epson hasn't maintained the high standards of quality , customer service and satisfaction it did in the past .  
2	  The Tripp Lite cable works better than any of the other manufacturers cables we had been using . I have not had a bad experience from this vebdor . I rate it a 5-star .  
1	  I got this player from Best Buy and thought that I had gotten a good deal . The battery life is very misleading . A charge overnight is supposed to give you 12 hours of battery life . With normal menu usage and about 600 songs the battery life dropped to maybe 2 hours . For the first two and a half months the player was fine and there was no trouble . Now my player freezes up within minutes of turning it on . The tech support from Creative is practivally non existent . I will have to send it in for repairs and hopefully have a better time . Thank God I bought the service plan from Best Buy .  
2	  Too many splitters were degrading my cable signal . This booster installed without a hitch , and my television and digital phone clarity increased immediately . However , my cable modem was unable to start / maintain a live Internet connection , even when connected directly to the booster . To fix this , I connected the modem to yet another coax splitter to cut the boost back down . Now things are working great . * because it did the polar opposite of what it promised for my cable Internet signal .  
1	  I purchased this HDMI cord for my Sony Bravia 32inch 1080i Tv , and i was totally disappointed . 1 . It made my TV show horribly ( even in HD ) 2 . It kept jumping everything i would try and watch something and 3 . I could usually watch my TV on 2 different outputs , with the HDMI cord in i could only view it on 1 channel . It was basically a big waste of time . I dont know how there are all these " Good Reviews " on here , because i missed how " GREAT " this HDMI cord works . Keep your money PLEAASE !  
2	  I want to see more AC adapters like this for most radio products just like the FR-200 such as the Grundig G3 , G5 , G6 , G8 , S-350DL . Those aftermarket AC adapters DO damage these radios , I want something that meets the specs and makes the product last longer . I had to get a OEM approved power supply netbook from here , why can I just simply buy an AC adapter for my special portable radios ?  
2	  Another fine quality lens from Canon . The detail achieved is fantastic and gives anybody a leg up on achieving super shots .  
2	  I had two different PCI adapters , trendnet MIMO and Netgear 54MBPs . They both gave me a lot of problems . This adapter is easy to install , works great . Much faster than the Trendnet or Netgear . Stay away from Netgear adapters . A lot of bugs . Bad software . This adapter is much cheaper than the Netgear and works better . I am very happy with it .  
2	  this could definialy be and ipod killer if they would just make it a little less fat . Other than that this player KILLS IPODS its got radio , wmv format , mic , all the good stuff . I dont think i even have a complaint .. hmm the touch pad is a little odd when u fist use it but after like an hour it becomes natural . The sound quality is xilent ! as far as i know the wmv format is much smaller than the mpeg video format so you could have the same size players and the zen would be abble to hold more than the ipod ( video ) . I personaly already have all my music ( only like 150-200 songs right now ) , star wars ( ep3 ) and full metal jackt on mine and ive only used 1.8 gigs ! in mpeg format the videos were at least twice the size as wmv . Oh one bag thing is it doesnt seem to suport . gif images , but as far as i know it converts them .  
2	  This is a very nice album . It holds the 5x7 photos that very few albums accept . I used this for my son 's wedding album , taking candid shots and having 5x7s made . It was difficult finding an album besides the magnetic albums , which I 've had bad experiences with in the past . This album is much sturdier than many others , and does justice to the wedding photos stored inside .  
1	  Ghosting and static all day , every day . If you need a replacement cable , find one with better shielding .  
1	  Not only did this machine fail to play my DVDs but it made a clicking sound when the DVDs were put in there . It only plays music CDs . This machine does everything BUT play DVDs . My advice to you is to never buy a remanufactured product , spring for the few extra dollars your peace of mind will be worth it in the end . I am still waiting on Amazon to either replace the player or give me back my money .  
2	  As this product was advertised to be designed for the Nikon cameras , I was a little hesitatnt to get it for my Canon Rebel XTi . But the price was good and several of the reviews implied that it would work with other cameras ' flashes ; so I took a chance . It works great ! It even includes instructions for what you need to do to trim the part of the diffuser into the hot-shoe of the Canon Rebel XTi 's . The Canon Rebel XTi ( maybe others , too ) hot-shoe has a very small micro-switch right at the anterior end of the hot-shoe 's right channel that , if depressed , disables the on-camera flash unit . So you have to trip a very small little square of the diffuser 's hot-shoe insert to make sure that the little micro-switch doesn't get inadvertantly depressed . When I first go the diffuser , in great haste to try it out , I had neglected to do that little trimming . The result was the my on-camer flash refused to work . At first I was frustrated and just little angry . Then , with a little experimenting , I found out that I could get the flash to work if i didn't push the diffuser 's tab so far into the hot-shoe . That got me to pondering if there might some sage words of wisdom in the instructions ( which I am natorioulsly bad about * not * readin ) and low ' n behold , there were very nice , clear , and definitive instructions for exactly how to use the difusser with my Rebel . A couple of little snips with some scissors and everything was perfect . I have now taken about 200 pictures using this little device and I can say that it is truly amazing ! It folds flat and fits nicely and without bulk into my shoulder camear case ; so I have this little difusser with me at all times . I normally use an off-camera flash and difussers on it ; but at times it is just not practical to use that off-camera flash . This little difuser really fills in the gap and my flash photos have taken a noticable and pleasant turn for the better . I would gladly and heartily recommend this diffuser to anyone looking for a difusser for their on-camera flash .  
2	  Advantages1 . Light in Weight - the Canon EF 400mm f / 5.6 L USM Lens is light in weight compared to the other Canon telephoto lenses . This is a huge advantage for bird photography , easy to maneuver when taking flight shots , not too tiring when trekking . 2 . Excellent Optical Performance - as a member of the Canon L Lens Series , the Canon EF 400mm f / 5.6 L USM Lens ' overall optical performance is outstanding . 3 . Fast focusing - thanks to the Ultrasonic Motor ( USM ) , the 400 f / 5.6 L internally focuses very fast and very quietly . 4 . Sharp Images - the Canon EF 400mm f / 5.6 L USM Lens performs superbly in the sharpness department . Even wide open , the 400 f / 5.6 produces very sharp images . 5 . Good Vignetting Performance - even the corners of full fame shots remain evenly colored without displaying any tendency to vignetting . Disadvantages1 . Image Stabilisation - one of the compromises of this budget lens is that it doesn't have image stabilisation ( IS ) . It can still be very successful for " handheld " or so-called " grab-shots " provided that a short exposure time and / or a higher ISO is used . When used together with the high quality EOS DSLR 's recently introduced by Canon , this disadvantage can be compensated . 2 . Water Resistance - another disadvantage of this lens is that it isn't 100 % water resistant like its more expensive cousins . ConclusionThe Canon EF 400mm f / 5.6 L USM Lens is hugely successful for bird and wildlife photography and especially for flight shots . It offers a good level of performance at a relatively low price . Canon EF 400mm f / 5.6L USM Super Telephoto Lens for Canon SLR Cameras  
2	  When I was much younger , like 18-20 I had a pair of Koss Headphones that I bought at a local music shop for like $ 15 . I 've never had a pair of headhpones i liked that much again . They technically still work , but I broke the connection between the headphone and the head band . I 've been using SennHeiser 201HD 's at work for a few years now . BUT the bass was never terribly pleasing . I had decided to buy a more expensive set of headphones and was reminded of my old Koss Headphones over Christmas . These things are amazing . The base response blows the Sennheisers out of the water ( and yes , I know they are twice as expensive ) the comfort unbelievable . I have even taken them to a local radio shack and they sounded better ( TO ME ) than the 249.99 Beats they had on display . I gotta say , these things rock . Frequency response is unbelievable in a cheap pair of headphones like these .  
1	  i think it came quick but the product box was totally smashed and ink was damaged and couldnt be used  
1	  This Power Adapter appears to be identical to the one that is supplied with theBelkin Wireless G Plus Router . I bought two of these routers from Belkin , and the power adapters that came with them both failed within two years ! Power adapters like this don't normally fail , so it is likely that they failed due to a faulty design or poor quality components . However , it is also possible that the above Belkin router design requires more power than this tiny adapter can provide ( 5 Watts ) . My power adapters never felt like they were over heated though , so I believe the adapter is simply not reliable . Therefore , if you buy this router , be prepared to buy a better power adapter !  
1	  The tuner on my LCD is awful . White stripes going across the screen all the time . It delivers the same result using the Composite signal ( A / V ) . Using the component ( Cr , Cb , Y ) gives a decent image only , but it is not HDTV , so forget about the Progressive scan DVD players . It will work as a computer monitor only if your video card detects it right , otherwise you will end up with black lateral regions without image . Not a good buy . Moreover , the company will only exchange the monitor for you if you have more than 3 dead pixels . Mine came with 4 to 6 bad pixels - lucky me ! Absurd !  
1	  When you buy something from Amazon , they give you this little idea section that says " customers that bought this . Also bought that " Well , I took their advice and got this item , it was the wrong size for my camera . So either the customer that bought that item and their camera screwed up or amazon messed up . BTW , I have had this happened 2 other times so i think it is amazon being very confused ! BTW when you try and return it be prepared for amazon to make you pay s & h ; cause they say " It isn't our fault " . Maybe they should get the recommendation section fixed or start taking responsibility for suggesting something wrong . I never buy anything in the suggested area !  
1	  I purchased the Monster-brand ScreenClean product with Microfiber cloth shortly after I purchased a state of the art HDTV ( Samsung 1080p LCD ) . I had been pleased with the quality and performance of my prior purchases of Monster-brand cables , and thought I could rely on receiving a similar quality product . I begin using the ScreenClean product with the accompanying Microfiber cloth , as directed . I was shocked to discover that the product left a visible chemical residue on the entire LCD glass . This is a brand new , expensive HDTV , which has been damaged by this product . In its present condition the TV is not usable , and has been rendered worthless . If I cannot remove this residue , I will need to purchase a new HDTV.I contacted Customer Service at Monster , but never received a response to my complaint . I believe this product is defective both as to the design of the formula and cloth , and the manner in which it is manufactured . The product should be recalled and either re-formulated or discontinued .  
1	  I got this gps two years ago , although it will work pretty well for a while , it will start tofreeze and you will have to reset it and lose all stored info in order for it to work again . But the main reason not to buy it is YOU WILL NEVER FIND ANY UPDATES , Even if you talk to a service rep from LG . FAIR WARNING . Buy a garmin .. At least you can depend on them . ART  
2	  Lost my wife 's lens cover . Thank goodness I found this one . Not expensive at all . I 'd rather pay to replace the lens cap than a scratched lens .  
2	  Finally a DVD player made in USA by a USA company . It is not only the best DVD player but the instruction manual for the Advance Setup Guide is in excellent English with explanations for each sellection on the menu . The complete manual is for the ALCU and is not necessary to let you setup for the best picture and sound . I have owned 2 Sony , 2 Samsung upconverting , 2 Panasonic upconverting and they don't do as good a job with the HDIM outputs on my HD Sony LCD 40 " KDL-V40XBR1 ( 1080i ) . I used a 5 port HDMI-Switcher to compare the picture . ( It is also highly recommended , ) Dr. D Peace , Texas  
2	  This is a FAST switch . It allows me to transfer data between my 3 computers so quickly that hard drive transfer rate becomes the limiting factor ( although I guess that should be a given since it IS gigabit and only one of my computers is running a RAID0 ) . My only qualm is that it does not always properly detect 1Gb vs 100Mb connections , and after running for a couple of months refused to allow a 1Gb connection at all on 3 of the 5 ports . Thankfully I was able to fix this by cycling the power ( unplugging it then plugging it back in ) but this really shouldn't be necessary . It was cheap and therefore certainly worth the money I spent on it despite its minor irregularities .  
2	  I got this for myself after the holiday season with some $ and gift certificates I had received . ( I didn't buy it here . ) It 's SLICK . Yes I use an Altoids tin as a case . Yes it always gets comments from every single person I show it too . Yes it 's slick . Picture quality is O K. I find the autofocus a little finicky , but there are so many options to choose from when taking photos that I 'm sure with a little practice I 'll get every picture looking perfect . I find the battery to run a little on the weak side , hopefully their next version will be more robust . But so far , so good . I 'd recommend it . It 's just too cool .  
1	  Bad connection signal . Usually , I can't get my image signal transfer to a projector or TV . It 's really annoying when you try to use it .  
1	  Seller lost this package at their facility and it took 2 months to receive it . I bought it as a gift and i 'm glad it took too long to get here . it 's flimsy and gets really tangled really easy . avoid at all costs .  
1	  I am on my second VCR of this same model and am going to return it for a different brand , don't waste your money on this machine . It cannot record or play tapes correctly , my old Magnavox that was falling apart did better than this one .  
2	  I was a little concerned with some of the negative reviews some people have had on this product , but I have been very pleased - no issues . My set up is slightly different since my desktop computer has a HD connector and my desktop has a SVGA . I ended up not connecting the desktop monitor to the KVM - it goes directly to the monitor . I then push a button on the monitor when I want to switch monitors . My monitor has a SVGA input which I connect the KVM into . Therefore when I want to switch from laptop to desktop , I hit the scroll lock twice and the input button on the monitor and the switching works great .  
1	  I 've had my MP390 for two years and have used it very lightly ( less than 4 reams of paper ) . Last week I received a " Cartridge Jammed " error message . I went through the online Canon tech support who instructed me how to unjam the print head which I did successfully . Now the printer makes a noise that sounds like a mini machine gun and it still has the " Cartridge Jammed " error message . I was told it was a hardware problem and it would need to be serviced . In the same tech support email I was offered a " customer loyalty discount " if I wanted to purchase another Canon printer . And I would want to do this why ? For this printer to break after approximately having only run 1700 sheets of paper through it really is inexcusable . I won't be buying another Canon , ever .  
1	  My review is that when you by something , and you always stick with a brand you trust j . v . c and your d . v . d player goes south within 3 months and 1day that really sucks but i thought it was just bad luck untill i seen your reviews on this product thank you john  
1	  I found out that the product you buy here ( great by the way ) is without the clip board and comes with old batteries . It was impossible to get service from this dealer . In the company 's site there are also extra refills , pens and batteries and the service was great .  
1	  When I first got this bag , I was so excited to use it . It has a good amount of padding on the inside and the bag itself feels durable . I purchased this on 8/13 and my zipper liners already broke . I can no longer use the zippers and they fell off track . I may have gotten a defective one but I would expect a bag at this price wouldn't fall apart in just a month . I hope customer service is good about this .  
1	  I ordered the first 5950 scanner from Page Computers . It arrived in two days . I couldn't get it to work after several hours of trying and working with the software setup . Called Tech Support at Microtek & they said the glass was warped on the scan bed & to send it back to retailer . I had to pay for return shipping & requested a replacement scanner . Took one month to process the return & get me a replacement scanner . Replacement scanner had the same problem . Now I 'm having to return the replacement as well and pay for more shipping . Sent letter and email to Microtek asking for help and didn't receive any reply .  
2	  I purchased this product to hook my Xbox 360 to my Creative Labs Audigy2 ZS . I 've successfully set up my Xbox 360 to output Dolby Digital into my computer and then into my speakers . The cable works . You can see the light coming out the other end when it 's hooked up to my Xbox 360 . I haven't encounter any problems with it and it 's worked flawlessly since I purchased it . The only complaint I have with it is that the wire is a bit thin , though I guess that was expected from the title of this product , though it was thinner then I expected . I don't know exactly how thick the wire is , but if I had to guess , the diameter would be about 2mm . There 's nothing wrong with being thin . I just feel that I melt accidentally snap it or something , but so far it 's been pretty sturdy .  
2	  I don't share the sentiments of the previous four reviewers of this product , but hey I havent even had the DVD Recorder even a week yet , but so far , I love it . At $ 98.74 @ Walmart the price was right , and it does seem too good to be true , I hope I don't live to eat those words . But I record my favorite shows / movies and they play flawlessly , I transfered my old VHS tape home videos onto DVD they play fantastic and will preserve the footage for generations . Now generally the cause of malfunction for a product causes usually range from not maintaining the product properly , they include an instruction manual for a reason , not just to tell you how to work the darn thing . But all and all I love my ILO 's DVD Recorder and I can now say I will use old VHS Tapes as Paper Weights .  
1	  I purchased this system for my father , as a father 's day gift . It arrived [ .. ] in a timely fashion , as always , but then I waited and waited and waited for DirecTV to get in touch with me for installation ( as indicated in the information provided on this page . ) When I finally got tired of waiting , I called them , figuring it was some sort of glitch . What I got was a rude , arrogant , don't know nothing don't want to know nothing attitude from the customer service person I spoke to who assured me that they did NOT provide installation . That was something I had to get from the place that sold it to me . And no matter how many times I tried to explain , the response was always , " No , you have to contact the place where you bought it . This isn't our problem . " Well I did contact the place where I bought it to tell them to take it back because I was not about to take this any further . And to Amazon 's eternal credit , they took it back , no questions asked , and apologized for the problem . In my opinion , they had nothing to apologize for ; they did what they were supposed to do . It 's DirecTV that fell down on the job . So ask yourself ( as I did ) do you want to be tied to a company that has such a loose definition of service ? The prospect of months or even years - assuming they ever bothered to hook up the system ; I have a friend who is still waiting nearly 10 months after recieving a system as a Christmas gift - of trying to get them to respond in case of problems , was just daunting . So I called DISH , they hooked up a system within 3 days and have always been polite and helpful when there have been problems or requests on this end . HUGE difference , and one I recommend you take into account before you commit to something like this .  
2	  I ordered this camera without any lens . I had all the lenses from my Canon EOS IIe which is a full frame 35mm film camera . All of the information I have read stated my lenses were compatible with the new camera . Naturally the first thing I did when I received the camera was to try all my various lens and they worked perfectly . I am very happy with my new digital camera and the flexibility it allows me to shoot in various situations . Anyone want a good buy on a Canon EOS 35mm IIe in excellent condition ?  
2	  In the past I purchased a SanDisk Ultra CF card because I was told the speed was much faster then the standard CF cards . So , I paid the premium and got the Ultra card and it works great . Recently , I needed to purchase another CF card and thought I would save some money and buy the EP Memory 512MB CF card . ( .. ) After receiving the card I immediately installed the card to see if I made a mistake . After using the CF card I could not see and difference in how either card worked . I am not saying that the Ultra is not faster , I am just saying , I could not tell . If you are a novice like me with digital cameras , you really do not need to spend the extra money for a faster card .  
2	  I wanted an mp3 player that was pretty good , not too big , and NOT an iPod , and this is perfect . Works great . The screen can be hard to see in direct sunlight though . I haven't had any problems with it , and it transfers music really easily .  
1	  My Windows Laptop has burned every kind of DIsk - and generally works great . Except with Verbatim . To date , I 'm getting it to accept / acknowledge about 1 in every 5 disks I try to burn . Save your money and get something else .  
1	  Do not buy this mouse ! I have not found a PC that it works with yet . The response speed from button clicks is so sluggish , I can not use it . No amount of tweaking the control panel settings will enable this mouse to be useful .  
1	  First I would like to say that I did not purchase this from Amazon . I did purchase this for my Macbook Pro as it stated that it supported Mac computers . That is not the case if you have a newer Intel Mac running osx 10 . x or better . There are no drivers and none of the universal drivers will work either . Avoid this product if you happen to have an Intel based Mac .  
2	  If you 're looking for a way to plug your PS3 ( or other HDMI out video console ) to an HDCP capable DVI monitor look no further . Note however that DVI does not carry audio signals , so you 'll be gaming without sound regardless of if the monitor has speakers or not . If your monitor does not have HDCP capabilities it will not function with a game system that requires it . It 's not a cable issue , it 's a monitor issue . Good quality works @ 1080p without any hickups so 5 * ' s from me , especially for the cheap price :)  
1	  I have no idea how this product is supposed to perform . I purchased this unit against the recommendations of others , due to over 20 years experience with Kenwood products in my home , at work and in my car , but this was an unmitigated disaster . I accepted the limitations in connections ( no HDMI , no upscaling , little flexibility ) for the size and supposed features . I connected everything that needed to be connected , double checked all speaker connections to ensure no shorts , turned on the unit and it went into standby . After 3 hours of rechecking all connections , swapping out cables and resetting the unit , I still didnt get anything other than fault / stand by . I went so far as to disconnect everything , and the unit went into standby . I expressed my frustration to the Kenwood customer service people and they recommended I check my cables . When I mentioned that the unit faulted with nothing connected , they sent the address of a service center , 20 miles away and recommended I take it there for service . Not being an acceptable answer , I sent an email to Kenwood customer service , the response to which was the equivalent of " Who cares , send it back then . " without any acknowledgement of the inconvenience or frustration of thinking I could get a quality product from a company I trusted for a long time . One would think the units are at least tested before leaving the factory , but apparently not . I returned the unit , went back to the recommendations of others and will be phasing out the rest of my Kenwood products simply for the reason of the uncaring customer service . If you get one that works , great , good for you , but why risk it ? Better to buy a product that has all the connection flexibility you need for now and future use .. stay away from this one unless you like frustration .  
1	  I bought this about 1.5 years ago , and from the get-go it would glitch on really bright events onscreen , like explosions . Now , even though I have rarely used it during the time I have owned it , I got the H07 error . This means that the motor has seized , so I have to trash it . Please do not buy this DVD player .  
2	  Microsoft did a great job with this webcam . Video quality is great and it works well in low lighting . My favorite thing of all is that the webcams design allows it to basically sit on any type of LCD monitor imagineable . I just switched from a 20 " to a 22 " and it fits no problem . Love it .  
1	  I bought a set of these headphones 2 months ago and they already quit working . They were very uncomfortable and never seemed to fit right . The cord began to come apart almost immediately .  
1	  My advice is to not buy this motherboard . Its refurbished and costs MORE than buying the entire laptop it goes to .. with an operating system ! Even if you just need the motherboard it would be cheaper to buy the whole thing and take what you need . So again , at the time i 'm writing this there are dell lattitude 's for sale on amazon that cost lest than this motherboard . oy .  
1	  I purchased this router because it was on sale , and I was forced to return it after it failed to function consistently . It took me nearly two hours to configure . After returning it , I got a Linksys and it was 5000 % easier to install and didn't have any of the problems this had . Yes , D-Link has good customer service , but they hire so many employees for that department only because they know their products are bound to fail and the customers will send frequent complaints .  
2	  We 've been using this brand of cartridge since we bought a couple of used LaserJet 4000 printers . The print quality is great , and cartridge life is pretty good . At 30 % of OEM cartridge price it 's a fantastic buy , and we 'll be buying more soon .  
2	  This is the ONLY screen protector that fits the new Palm Tungsten T3 . All of the others are slightly too short . So , it 's simple : If you want a screen protector to protect your T3 , this is it .  
1	  Can't use this item as an all purpose voltage regulator only came with the cable to hook up to a computer outlet . I 'm overseas and isn't not worth returning . I will have to buy a special adapter to hook it up to my tv or electrical appliances , as this why I purchased the item .  
2	  After reading the reviews , I figured why not - I 'd only be out $ 2 if they weren't what I was expecting . Well , I got the cable , hooked it up to my gaming system and TV and lo and behold - worked great ! Very happy and even happier that I 've found a place that I can purchase an HDMI cable for this cheap . Highly recommend this to anyone not wanting to spend a lot more $ at their local store .  
2	  This is a very nice camera with a very good zoom range . A tripod is recommended if available over the image stabilization modes provided . With a tripod , the image quality at both ends of the zoom range is great for prints to 8x10 or possibly larger . With a 4 Gb memory card , the camera will take over 1100 high resolution pictures or near half an hour of 20 fps XVGA video . White balance is OK , but for shooting backlight , snow , xmas lights , be sure to use the scenery modes rather than standard picture mode . However , the dynamic range is good enough you can salvage mis-shots with photoshop , etc . It would be nice if there were a cap available to cover the lens when stored . The battery life is nothing to write home about , and transferring files using usb or pict bridge seems to really drain the camera . Advise getting a spare battery and the optional DC power supply .  
1	  I enjoy running and mountain biking with my iPod and iPod shuffle . I wear over-the-ear ear-bud headphones every day and own quite a few sets . My current favorites are some inexpensive ones branded Phillips ( though I have seen other company 's names on the same model ) but I have been unable to find them recently , so I got these Sony 's to try . Big disappointment . The sound is really quite poor . It is tinny and high , almost piercing at higher volumes , and totally lacks bass . Plugging my old earbuds into the same device without adjusting the volume and comparing it to these Sonys just underscores how poorly these perform . The fit is also lacking . When running , there is nothing which breaks the revery of hitting your stride like constantly having to shove an earphone back in your ear . They hang over your ear like overcooked linguini . I could even excuse the poor sound quality if they stayed put for more than 1/4 mile of running . I would only give them 1 star but they look kind of nice , so I decided to be generous .  
2	  Portability is great - one size fits all vehicles . Good map grid for negotiating thru traffic construction areas in unfamiliar territory . Voice is nice for verbal directions ( a dial volume control might be better ) . Bean bag base is safe & secure while in transit . Have not yet used the traffic update feature . I would recommend this product to friends and others .  
2	  These are my first pair of earbuds with the little silicone cups that block out external noises . This technology really is a big improvement over the cheaper foam covered earbuds . Not only do you not hear a lot of noise around you , you don't need nearly the volume from the player which saves battery life . Thats a general comment that could apply to any noise blocking earbud . The V-Moda indeed have deep bass , and required me to adjust the equalizer profile to de-emphasize bass and max out trebble , compared to the foam covered earbuds that were replaced . These will deliver all the bass you want , but do not deliver the chrystalline tinkle-tinkle highs that you may be used to from your high-end home or car stereo . Still , that only took me a day or so to get used to , as the horns and cymbal crashes can still be heard .. just not like you are standing next to the instrument . Judging from what you could pay for earbuds these days , these seem to be a fair value and are a big , big improvement over foam earbuds .  
2	  I bought these speakers so I could play my guitar along with the music on the media player on my computer . They sound great . Supprisingly deep lows , crisp but not brittle high end and smooth in the middle . They look good too . Too bad there are still so many wires .  
2	  After researching on the internet for a video capture device , I finally decided on the Plextor ConvertX ( PX-M402U ) . I 've only had it a couple of days and am happy with the results . Setup was very easy and within a couple of hours I captured 2 hours of video from my analog camcorder and had made a DVD with transition effects and titles . Quality of playback was as good if not better than the original ( I captured in standard play - wondering if I captured in high quality if it would look even better ) . The only complaint I have is that my computer froze once while editing . I believe that was due to such a large file and I keep hitting buttons thinking the system wasn't responding . Overall I am pleased with the product but make sure your computer meets all the requirements . My CPU runs at about 95 % usage while editing .  
2	  Kingston Data Traveler 100 4GB USB 2.0Nice design , and good price per GB  
2	  How do you get pictures and movies on your email ? I have windows XP and can't get things loaded onto the computer without it playing on just the camera .  
2	  I accidently left my ultra powerful magnet which is used for magnet fishing on my tv . I turned the tv on and messed up my tv pretty good . I didnt think it could be repaired even with this device but after one round , my tv was back to normal again . Believe it !  
1	  i was very excited to receive this in the mail . but right when i opened the box BAM this thing is HUGE ! i have a 7 1/8 hat size and a shaved head . this is too ridiculously big its embarrassing to wear out . theres better smaller over the ears here on amazon . wouldnt recommend this one  
1	  The screen is the exact size of my display area but the little sticky tabs they give with it are all but useless . You 'd do better with scotch tape to hold it in place . In my opinion a waste of money .  
1	  18 % transmission piece of white plastic nothing else , waste of money . same material as the incident dome on all light meters . exact same item for <$ 10 and in sizes that actually fit your camera . MeNon white balance camera lens cap .  
1	  I replaced my Belkin Wireless-B USB adapter with this one ( I am using these with a Belkin Wireless-G router ) . Big mistake - transfers are nearly twice as slow and the signal is lost intermittently . I tried to contact Linksys to address these issues by phone , waited on hold for over two hours , and was finally disconnected . I then sent a detailed e-mail to tech support describing my problems , but received no response . The Belkin-b is cheaper , faster and more reliable than this adapter , and Belkin has great tech support , if needed .  
1	  No it breaks too fast , The fan blades hit the housing so the blades break off one by one , where 's the quality ?  
1	  Linksys / Cisco is lying to consumers by providing three different products with totally different features and warranty periods , yet describing the products the same model number . Please permit me to present my credentials : I am a computer systems professional of 15 years and former loyal Linksys customer . I can't use Linksys at work , but at home network / lab uses about a dozen of their products . My setup includes BEFCMU10 , BEFW1154 , WRT54GS , EZX516W , AS2TNC , BEFSX41 , EG1032 , WPC54GS , some in duplicate , and a few others not in regular use . Before today I would confidently recommend Linksys products to the numerous relatives , friends , and neighbors who seek my advice . Now that Linksys has engaged in deceptive practices I can no longer recommend their products to anyone . The problem is that Linksys apparently now uses " version " numbers to designate completely different products . The result is that what you buy might not be what you heard about ! Complaints and confusion here on Amazon are caused by these differences . Both the model numbers and the UPC numbers are the same . The products , however , are as different as if from different vendors . The original ( EG005W ver . 1 ) had a possibly noisy cooling fan , from what I have read , but it has the same form factor of the earlier stackable Linksys series and no other major complaints apart from fan noise . The EG005W ver . 2 does not have a fan , yet has the same form factor as the earlier stackables . It has 16 LEDs showing power , link / activity , speed , and duplex . The power supply is 12v / 2A . It has a TWO year warranty . The EG005w ver . 3 is a totally different smaller form factor and totally different specifications . In fact , everything is smaller : It has only 6 LEDs , a 12v / . 5A power supply , but worst of all , only ONE year warranty . According to the packaging of both , ver . 2 and ver . 3 are otherwise technically / specifications identical , but this is insufficient to distinguish versions ( or brands for that matter ) . In all fairness , I know from my numerous Linksys purchases that they , like other vendors , make incremental improvements to products that merit different version numbers , but not for different model numbers . A great example is the WRT54GS ; later versions are pretty impressive yet incremental improvements . The problem here is that this the three versions are TOTALLY DIFFERENT . Ver3 is hardly more similar to Ver2 than the HP J9077A # ABA , the NETGEAR GS108 , or the D-link DGS-2208 , notwithstanding number of ports . So Buyer beware !  
1	  This is a redundancy purchase . Amazon was cheating on the " Frequently Bough Together " advertising . The Antenna came with a mount kit .  
1	  I like the idea of the product . However , maybe I am missing something here , I could not get two of the seven buttons to work . They are the " Play List Song Select " and " Play List Random " buttons . I 've read the manual and searched Scosche 's website and could not find a solution . The basic functions of the other five buttons do work . These are the Volume Up and Down , Track Forward and Backward , and Pause / Play / Sleep buttons . However , I could not do " press and hold " to move forward or backward within a track . According to the manual these should work . Also , from my remote although I could put my iPod to sleep , I could not do the reverse action of waking it up .  
2	  This is a good strap . I use it on a Nikon D60 and it may be overkill . The card pockets are convenient if you want carry extra cards or a Nikon remote but otherwise inhibit your ability to slide the strap smoothly if you carry over the neck and shoulder . Minor inconvenience . So , if you don't need the pockets and have a light camera a lighter strap would work as well . Very comfortable and the pockets could be cut off if you really don't like them . When used as intended the ends of the neoprene padding tend to snag on cotton clothing . It would work better if some nylon cloth was sown over the ends to prevent this . So , I use the strap with the neoprene padding up which lets it slide up my shoulder better . I believe this backwards from its intended design but , it works better for me and the neoprene still distributes pressure . Allows all day carry with comfort .  
1	  The same thing just happened to me-I plugged it in , it worked great , I turned off the car and unplugged everything to go into a store , I came back and plugged it back and the ipod won't turn on . I didn't notice any sparks , but the ipod reset instructions are not doing anything . perhaps this is a bad batch ? has it happened to anyone else ?  
2	  The case is great . It is a perfect fit for the Ipod Nano . The leather is good quality and it looks a lot more expensive than the affordable price on Amazon . The shipping was prompt and I am very satisfied with the product . I would order from this seller again .  
1	  This set of headphones has great sound quality , however , it 's only marginally better on paper than its Sony counterpart . Because it has problems with a very brittle headband , and will very quickly crack and break away entirely into sharp pieces of hard plastic , I cannot recommend these headphones except for review for product safety . Every time I have to send away my pair to get repaired I have to pay for shipping to Sennheiser , and I am without the headphones for weeks as a result . Save yourself a headache and possibly further physical injury and consider getting the Sony headphones ..  
2	  This is by far the best electronics purchase I have made in a long time . I purchased my first DVP642 about two months ago and I have thoroughly enjoyed it . It plays just about everything you throw at it . Unlike some other reviewers , I have had no problems with DVDRW 's . I only use high-quality media which could account for my success . I have a friend that also owns an DVP642 , and he was having problems with just about anything burned ; he bought better DVDR media and no longer has any problems . This is a truly wonderful player that does what it says . Make sure that you load the firmware update as soon as you get your player . It is also VERY easy to make this system region-free . One of the other wonderful aspects to this player is that it converts PAL - & # 62 ; NTSC on the fly . I can't say enough good about the Philips DVP-642 . I have already recommended it to all my friends .  
1	  The Headphone was defective , i.e. , was only Mono even though it is spec 'd as a stereo ( & I believe it is that - based on others ' usage ) .. so returned .. am going to try others before coming back to this one .  
2	  I purchased this three pack to test out a vintage Polaroid I found at a thrift store . The battery pack is built into the film and it works just fine . I wish that film for these cameras was not so expensive ; however , I understand why it is . I was not disappointed with this item .  
1	  I bought the CR79 because I wanted something that would look nice in my paneled livingroom . I chose this model specifically because of the external speaker outputs . I thought that if I did not like the sound quality of the built in speakers , I could hook up my own . Let 's take the features of this item one by one , in the order of from the worst to the best . The CR79 has the cheapest looking turntable I have ever seen . It would be very easy to break something just by inattention . I put a good quality stereo record from the 60 's on it , and the sound was like something from the 1930 's or 40 's . My wife described it as " music in a can " . The AM / FM radio is better , but the sound is all in the mid-range , lacking any real base or clear highs . The reception wasn't too impressive , either . The tape cassette was considerably better . But I had never before seen one where you have to open the door by inserting your thumb into a hole and prying it open . No button to push to eject ? The CD player has better sound than the phono , radio or cassette , but wouldn't you expect that anyway ? Even so , it still lacks range . The CR79 's best feature is its appearance . There 's no denying it looks nice sitting there in the living room . It looks well put together , and does not dominate the room . The wood finish looks like a rubbed oil finish that might not be all that durable . A coat of urethane would be a good idea . It 's too bad that the Chinese manufacturer of these units did not make them sound as good as they look . This unit is overpriced for what it delivers . It is not a sound system at all , but really just a home decoration item . I returned it to Amazon the next day and ordered the TEAC DC D6300 . It is everything the Crosley is not and five dollars cheaper as well .  
2	  I have a 30 gb ipod , and have had several mp3 players before . This 2 gb device was purchased for my jogs . It performs wonderfully . There is a short learning curve to organizing songs into folders , but I love the sound and the tiny featherweight package is easy to carry about . The radio is not as good as the one on my old iaudio , but still it picks up the local stations well enough . If the radio were a bit stronger , it would get 5 stars . Highly recommended for joggers .  
2	  This TOSlink to Miniplug is the perfect addition to my home theater . I use it to attach the Optical headphone jack on my Mac mini to my Yamaha 5.1 receiver . The mini connects to a HDTV LCD via DVI-HDMI cable and needs a separate audio connection . Sound quality is excellent with this cable ! And the price cannot be beat ..  
1	  For this price I would rather buy Radeon 9800 , Radeon 9800 will Over clock at Pro , And the diffrence with ATI and Nvidia is huge especially with AA enabled .  
2	  I purchased this Alphasmart Dana for my nine-year-old daughter to help her with her homework - and she absolutely loves it ! She uses the built-in Alphaword ( word processing ) program which appears full-screen , and she prints via infrared to any one of several IR printers we have in our home ( an HP 990 , 995 , 450 portable or Photosmart 1315 , to be more specific ) . She saves all of her work to her own 32 MB SD memory card . The Alphasmart turns on immediately ( unlike a PC which needs time to boot up ) ; the batteries last for days ( and she even knows where to plug in the recharger when they get low ) . The unit is easy to use and very durable . Everything she needs to word process is self-contained in the Alphasmart Dana ; and she never needs to sync with a PC in order to use it ! ( The Alphasmart , incidentally , will also print via a USB cable - but that isn't nearly as much fun for my daughter as printing wirelessly . ) She composes her writing assignments while sitting in a chair or on a sofa . She uses a lapdesk ( that we purchased from Levenger , a mail-order company ) when she works on our bed . Needless to say , she loves the Alphasmart Dana because it allows her to use it just like " Daddy 's laptop , " which she easily prefers over sitting at a desk and typing on a standard PC.I also use the Alphasmart Dana for my own word processing ( to write product reviews such as this one ) while I 'm waiting for my daughter or her brother at their sports or music practices . I have my own SD memory card to keep my work separate . And I like how I can import the text into a MS Word document open on my computer simply by hooking up a USB cable and hitting the function key marked " send . " ( Any receiving PC can accept the data - and doesn't need to have the Alphasmart Palm desktop installed in order to do so . ) The standard dictionary and spell checker which comes with the Alphasmart Dana is fairly inadequate . I 've downloaded the Noah Pro dictionary and thesaurus from PalmGear . com , and both are significantly better . The formatting capabilities of the Alphaword program have been generally sufficient for most of my daughter 's assignments . For those times when an extra level of " prettiness " is required , my wife will normally upload the text to a MS Word file , and format the document accordingly . Neither my daughter nor I use the other Palm features ( such as calendar , address book , to-do list , or memo ) that 's included . ( I use my Palm 515 for those . ) We use the Alphasmart strictly as a friendlier , more durable - and less expensive - version of a laptop computer . In this capacity , the Alphasmart Dana has performed wonderfully . My daughter now loves to write - and does so without any prompting . The Alphasmart Dana has proven to be an excellent investment . I highly recommend it !  
1	  I bought this mount because I wanted to be able to adjust both the vertical and horizontal alignment of my new HDTV panel . The product description says this item can handle up to 50 pounds . My panel is about 44 pounds and the vertical adjustment simply cannot handle the weight of the panel . I used the " heavy load " bolt that 's supposed to take care of this but it doesn't even come close . The TV doesn't just slip down a bit . It just sags against the wall . I can't imagine this mount could hold up a panel over 20 pounds without assistance . FWIW , the mount does feel sturdy and it can hold the panel securely . I 'm using a block of wood to offset the bottom of the panel from the wall . I 'll replace that with a V-shaped brace that acts as a cable guide and will let the horizontal swivel function of the wall mount to work properly . Also , the screws included with the mount were too small . They didn't fit my TV and the screw heads were so small , they slipped through the larger 100mm mounting holes . The lag bolts provided had little hex heads meant to be tightened with the included allen wrench . Terrible . Who wants to screw nearly 3 inches of bolt into a stud with an allen wrench ? ! ? I replaced them with 5/16x3 " lag bolts and used a socket wrench . I understand they 're trying to make a simple installation but there 's no way to get around the fact that the holes for the mount need to be drilled into the stud . Anyone who has a drill will have a proper set of wrenches for driving proper bolts . I only gave this two stars because , after a trip to the store for proper screws , and with the addition of a bracket to provide the proper offset , this mount seems like it will hold my TV off the floor and allow me to swivel it from side to side . However , I wouldn't recomment this product for any panel over 15 pounds . 20 tops .  
1	  Easy to setup to watch a DVD , but once you try to hook up additional devices to it - watch out . 1 - Manual is way too basic . It provides some help , but doesn't provide full explanations on how things work . It points to things on the remote and DVD player , but doesn't explain what its used for or how to use it . 2 - Website provides no support . Questions answered are akin to the manual . The same very very basic ' plug power cord into power outlet ' solutions . Even searching for something like ' component video ' yields * no results * ! How can that be , there are ports right on the back of the player and there are no instructions on how to use it ? 3 - Phone Support . Very nice people , but really didn't know how to use my machine either . Firstly they didn't understand my question . They were asking me things like ' tell me what buttons are on your tv remote ' .. um .. ' 1 .. 2 .. 3 ' ! ? ! ? Even after understanding what I was asking , they didn't have an answer , and coudlnt ' transfer me to someone else . They couldn't say ' I Don't know ' but kept running in cirlces . * How can a manufacturer put a product out in the market and not tell you how to use it ? * As you can tell , I TRIED ALL AVENUES OF SUPPORT TO NO AVAIL . So basically , I still don't know how certain aspects of this machine work . In short , I will never buy another samsung product again , since they dont ' tell you how to use it . Its amazing that they can spend all this money on differnt channels of support , and to have absolutely no value .  
1	  Look great on paper , but the optics on the first one I received were misaligned , giving a double image that would not converge . Assuming that was a fluke , I exchanged the item . On the second one , the plastic piece housing the axial rod around which the oculars rotate when changing interpupillary distance was split down the middle , rendering this one useless as well . Perhaps I would have had better luck with a third unit , but clearly there are some major problems in manufacturing and quality control .  
1	  This keyboard folds out well and I liked the feel of the keys . However , the IR connector needs to be in direct connection with the IR port in the PDA . For the iPaq , this port is at the bottom of the handheld . The 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area . In order to have the proper connectivity , you have to turn the handheld on its side . This then requires another software program download ( not freeware that I can find ) to rotate your screen to the landscape view , unless you can read sideways without getting a headache . Before buying this product , check your handheld to see if your IR port is between 4-8 o'clock - if so , this may be a difficult keyboard to use .  
2	  The Nextar C3 works as good as I expected for the price I paid ( $ 149 ) . I will recommend it . I had it for 3 months got to move from Tennessee to upstate New York . The directions were right all the way up and I been using it to get around in my new state and no problems so far . PROS : - Price-Size-It acquires satellites faster than my Garmin . - Usually gets me within 10-20 feet of my destination , if the destination is in the map . - More stuff than you need like a remote control and mp3 player . CONS : - * The maps seem to be about 2 years old . I was living in a 2 year old development and the Nextar C3 kept telling me I was off road . - The lighter power cable is to stiff ; I wish it had a straight cable instead of a phone cord looking one . It pulls on the device and I 'm afraid it might break the plug in . So I only use it to recharge The charge lasts for about 6 hours of continuous use .  
1	  This is horrible quality . It buckles under the weight of anything and it isn't very fashionable either .  
2	  just what I needed for my mum and dad for them to be safer in the house . Both have mobility issues - so this gives them some peace of mind  
2	  These earbuds aren't bad at all and really nice for average buds and for the price . I bought em couple years ago and I still use them .. because they still work unlike some other ones . Straight 2.0 jacks never works for me cause they always get damages the way I use them but this has L shaped jack and it works perfect for me and the joints and the wire itself is very flexible so they don't break down easily . Only thing I personally didn't like was the the length difference .  
2	  Most of the reviews on amazon were so poor , I was hesitant to order . I have to say , I 'm glad I took a chance on the iTrip . 5 star rating , and here 's why : Design - Beautiful-It matches the shapes and lines of the ipod mini perfectly . - No batteries ! Takes power from the mini 's battery ( no noticeable difference in the mini 's battery life ) - Shuts off with 60 seconds of silence ( exactly when the mini shuts off ! ) - Indicator light on the top right ( flashes when connecting to radio , stays full when connected and playing ) Performance-Good in most areas , especially on the east coast-Not too good in densely populated areas , like NY , LA , etc . - Quality of sound is excellent where I live ( New Jersey ) - Can change stations directly from the miniReviews-Besides amazon reviews , ipod lounge thought differently . They gave the iTrip mini an A- ( Highly Reccomended ) Conclusion-If you 're an iPod mini owner who needs FM transmission , I think that you 'll be happy with the results you get from Griffin 's iTrip mini . Overall , it 's a great accessory to add to your mini . And for 21 bucks from Amazon , it 's a must have !  
1	  This player is advertised as USB 2.0 and it is NOT USB 2.0 . The transfer rates are very slow , they act like USB 1.1 . Other than the poor transfer rates this is a good player . Tech support personel for RCA / Thompson are dumb as rocks . They tried to tell me the audio bitrate of an mp3 affects the transfer rate from computer to the portable device . They also said that MusicMatch made the trasnfers faster which is not true as well , as the device is made for drag and drop functionality . If you want USB 2.0 DO NOT buy this player . Also check out the circuit city website link here about the same issuses other people are having 4th one down on this page $U$ one down on this page as well $U$  
2	  I don't think u can find any other type of projector with this price ( cost only US $ 499 ) . I used Viewsonic LCD monitor , too . Overall , I am very satisfied with Viewsonic quality-control . I think , I will continue to look for Viewsonic products FIRST in the future if I need something to buy . I like this projector very much .  
2	  Super camera . Great picture and sound for such a little camera . Posted first video on Youtube .  
1	  Tick , tick , tick , tick , tick .. it will get you too ! It lurks within . The dreaded H07 ( after four years ) finally struck my Panasonic down . Based on the dozens of messages below , there is no recourse . Thus , I 'm taking a hammer to it this evening - should be fun ! If you own one , it 's only a matter of time . If you just bought one - take it back ! Run to the store ! Panasonic is laughing at you .  
2	  I grew up with a big base scanner . This one is one eighth the size and picks up so much more . I programmed in over 50 local frequencies from the Internet and the scan features flies through them , so you don't miss much . The manual may seem a little intimidating but once you know the basics , the scanner will be easy to operate . Some of the transmissions cut off and on periodically but I live out in the boonies , so that may have something to do with it . I live in an area that is susceptible to brush fires and floods , so this will come in handy . Quick delivery too , by the way . Thank you , Amazon .  
2	  I replaced my Etymotic 6is with these because the Etys developed a short in the cord . My immediate impression was that these do have superior sound quality to the Ety 6is . I 've never heard the Ety 4s , so perhaps these are more comparable to those - and the Altec Lansing IM616 's comparable to the Ety 6is - a common assertion I keep running across on the ' Net . The IM716s have a bit better bass in the HD position ( and A LOT more in the Bass position ) than the Ety 6is . They also sound a bit more detailed . Quite nice considering I got these for about the same price as the 6is . As for eartips , I dislike foamies so I didn't even try those . I don't like the 3-flange tips that come with the IM716s because they have to be pushed farther into the ear that I 'm comfortable with in order to provide decent bass response . Fortunately the eartips for the Ety 6is also fit the IM716s , so I was able to put some 2-flange tips on the IM716s - comfortable fit and good sound ! I don't know whether any of the filters for any of Etymotics ' models fit the Altec Lansing ' phones ; I suspect not because the barrel that holds the speakers looks larger on the Altec Lansing ' phones than on the Etys . My main complaint about the Altec Lansing is the inline module that allows the listener to switch between Bass and HD modes . The module adds considerable weight to the cord . This wouldn't be so bad if the clip on the module was designed well , but it 's a shallow metal clip that isn't easily attached to clothing . ( In contrast , the clip in the middle of the Ety 's cord is a plastic alligator clip that allows you to open it up and " pinch " it on any kind of fabric area you want . ) Having a clip like this - particularly in the position it is in - is not good for exercise clothes . The module and the clip would have been much better with a better clip design and a better location on the cord ( much closer to the jack that plugs into the player instead of a foot away from the listener 's ears ) . The end result of this poor design is that when I exercise , the cord is left to flop around . Given the microphonics issues involved in many IEMs , having a cord flopping around like this is far from ideal . Overall I am happy with my purchase . I definitely prefer the sound quality of these to the Ety 6is , though I do like the design of the 6is more .  
1	  Less than two years ago , I bought an Orion / Sansui TV . Less than a year later , it blew up . Was under warrantee , so they had to pay for it 's repair . The digital board was shot among other things . Now less than a year after that , it blew up again . Called Orion assuming that the replacement parts from less than a year ago would also be under the same 1 year warrantee , but was shocked to discover they only put a 90 day warrantee on their replacement parts . So I told the lady very nicely that she could at least pay the $ 35 to have my set looked at by the repair shop and she wouldn't do it . So I told her they were gonna lose one way or the other . I obviously bought a lemon , and they wouldn't stand behind their product , nor their parts . I told her she could help me out , or with my remaining 30 or 40 years on this planet I would tell everyone I know to NOT BUY ANY ELECTRONICS FROM ORION . I assured her that I would be certain to persuade enough people to not buy their product that they would be worse off than standing behind their product now . She chose this route : DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ORION . IT IS JUNK , and they will NOT stand behind their product .  
2	  Took a chance on this $ 2 HDMI cable and its mind blowing how great it is . I compared it to my friends Sony HDMI cable and saw no difference in quality from his $ 70 Sony cable and this $ 2 cable . This cable is great for the money . Definitely getting your moneys worth with this cable .  
1	  OK , I 've been holding off with this review until I 've used the Nitrus for a couple months just to be fair . The small size is great and the 1.5 GB is enough space for me to have at any 1 time . The USB 2 interface moves files to the Nitrus quickly and the battery life is excellent . For those who have been comparing this to the IPOD , I think you 're nuts . I don't have an IPOD , but I can't believe that the Nitrus sounds better . The sound is tinny , even after tweaking with the equalizer . The headphones are most likely an embarrassment to Sennheiser . I 've already ditched the headphones for a pair I already own . The Rio Music Manager software is clumsy at best . It allows me to choose certain features ( such as " least often played " when choosing Content Deletion properties ) , however , when synchronizing it tells me that this feature isn't support by my $ 249 player . Again , I would be shocked beyond belief if the IPOD 's software package were as clunky as this . Lastly , there is no clip for the player . I either have to hold it or put it in a pocket or set it on something . It is very light and when the headphone cord is pulled slightly , the whole case goes flinging . Seems like a $ 2 clip would have been included , but it is not . My only hope is that perhaps firmware / software upgrades will solve the sound quality and music manager issues . I may just use some rubberbands for a clip somehow . All things considered , I would shell out $ 100 more ( really only $ 80 after buying my own headphones ) and buy an IPOD .. Sorry Rio , but it 's just a disappointment .  
2	  THis router works great for the two computers that we need wired for our house . For some reason ive had trouble connecting more than 2 uses to the router though .. but the third and fourth arent needed . Good router . Good price .  
2	  I normally don't review items , but I was so impressed by this little thing that I felt compelled . I 'm a DishNetwork customer who uses a 2 room DVR . Our house isn't huge , but its quite a way from our bedroom to the living room where the actual DVR sits . We 've been fighting with our 2nd room RF remote from Dish for years trying to get it to work consistently . We 're constantly adjusting the antenna , replacing batteries , and trying any and every remote control position to try to get the signal to the DVR . While looking for a solution to another problem , I ran across the Next Generation remote extender so I thought I 'd give it a try . Wow ! It worked perfectly right out of the box . We placed the emitter in our entertainment cabinet in the living room , placed the battery transmitter in a universal remote in the bedroom , programmed the remote with the IR codes , and voila , we were controlling the living room DVR . It works flawlessly every time . If I could rate this with 6 stars , I would . I 'm ordering another unit so I can control the upstairs DVR from my downstairs office . Now my only question is whether or not a second unit will interfere with the first . I guess I 'll soon find out . :)  
1	  Update : After writing an email to the President of Samsung USA , 2 PR people that work at the firm responsible for Samsung 's account I finally got a response from Samsung other then telling me to wait and they would get to it whenever . All in all it took me four + months and several hours on the phone to get a refund . I have to give them credit , once I wrote the people mentioned above someone called me the next day and shortly after my conversation with her I finally received a shipping label in my email to send the monitor back . I received the refund 3-4 weeks later . Last time I ever buy Samsung . - Poor product with no customer service . First as promised to Jennifer ( Executive Customer Service Supervisor ) : the phone number for Exec Service # 800-522-7341 & fax # 973-529-0293My first three ( 3 ) 305T monitors had problems right out of the box and my fourth ( 4th ) worked for 8 months and then died . ( Please note that all of these monitors were purchased brand new from three different retailers : Amazon , Newegg , B & H ; Photo ) . Monitor # 1 didn't work at all . Monitor # 2 : had a row of dead pixels that went from side to side of the monitor horizontally ( my screen looked like it had a divider between the top and the bottom ) . Monitor # 3 made bubbling noises whenever it was turned on . Monitor 4 worked great for about 8 months and then one day started rapidly flashing ( not a typical flicker , but more like the monitor was going on and off ) so bad that I had a terrible migraine after about 15 seconds . Now I 've had the joy ( sarcasm ) of contacting Samsung 's Executive Service ( ECS ) . I first contacted Samsung executive customer service ( ECS ) September 12th and informed them that ideally they would like my money refunded . A few weeks after I had performed the steps requested by ECS ( faxing my receipts in , etc ) I called to check the status , and apparently my claim has been closed ; no explanation could be given as to why . As a result I was forced to start over ( this is early October ) . Skip ahead ( past several phone calls and once of Samsung " not being able to find the receipts I submitted to them " ) to November 12th , I am approved for a refund since Samsung has no 305T monitors in stock to replace mine with ( never mind that fact that this was my 4th one and I have provided Samsung with all of my receipts ) . I 'm told that I should receive a shipping label to send my monitor back and should have a refund within 14-21 days from the Nov . 12th . As of this morning ( December 8th ) I have yet to receive a return shipping label and have heard the same pitch from ECS reps over and over again ( " I am not sure what the delay is , but I will contact the refund department and CC their and my supervisor on the message . " ) . So today I try a new tactic : I ask to speak to an ECR supervisor . Jennifer comes on the phone and tells me quite rudely that I " need to be patient " and that I " have only been waiting since October 12th " . I inform Jennifer that I actually called in September 12th to which she interrupts me and informs me that date is irrelevant and that the delay is caused do to the ( untrue ) fact that I exchanged the monitor with a retailer originally ( and I need to be more patient ) . Next , I tell Jennifer to look at all four receipts I submitted , as she will notice that none of the monitors were exchanged and each was made in separate purchases . Jennifer pauses for a minute and then tells me that the refund department does not typically issue refunds , they typically issue exchanges , so that is the reason for the delay and that I need to be more patient . ( If you do a little research you will find out that others have been told they will receive refunds , so that process doesn't seem to uncommon . ) We speak a little bit more with the end result being : I still don't know when I will receive a refund , but apparently I need to learn to be more patient and how much time it takes is irrelevant ( at least to Samsung and their Executive Customer Service rep supervisors , such as Jennifer ) . Also , as I promised Jennifer I am posting the direct line to ECR : 800.522.7341 & ECR 's fax 973.529.0293 in case anyone wants it . My next step : I guess will most likely filing a small claims suit against Samsung if I don't receive anything by the end of December . I hope this information helps . If anyone has any advice / tips it would be greatly appreciated  
1	  I bought this battery for my laptop and after two days of use the battery is completely dead . I tried to contact amazon to get it replaced and they sent me on a wild goose chase .  
2	  I have never had an issue using Hewlett Packard ink cartridges . Remanufactured ones have given me grief in the past and I will not use them .  
2	  I was looking for a memory card for my cell phone which has a music player on it . For a 1 gb hard drive , there is no better buy . It was easy to use .  
1	  I can confirm that the cartridges shipped with this photo value pack have a fraction of the ink capacity of normal cartridges . While there is nothing at all that indicates this in any of HP 's marketing materials ( bad HP ) it becomes clear when you install them . The ink level gauges on the printer show much smaller bars for these than the regular cartridges - and indeed they do run out very quickly compared to normal cartridges . Face it - HP is all about making very large profit margins from selling ink , and they aren't dumb . If you want to buy an ink combo pack of full cartridges you can search amazon for HEWLETT PACKARD 02 COMBO PACK - you will find this listed as of today at $ 60 and not that much of a discount vs . buying single cartridges .  
2	  This card works like a dream . I use it to store almost everything including uploaded videos and photos made on my cell . And the transfer time is pretty fast . I have another that holds only about 128mb which works great also . But the 1 gig allows me to backup much more stuff . And the price can't be beat . I plan to purchase the card with 2 or more gigs now . It costs a little extra but definitely worth it .  
1	  Make sure you will not need to return the product . Price $ 5 , Shipping $ 5 , if I wanted to return - shipping non-refundable + 20 % restock fee ( product in original packaging ) . Otherwise , out of 2 purchased products total $ 20 , I was going to get a refund of less than $ 8 .. Rip off if you need to return ..  
2	  I got one question , for those who have bought these earphones , does these specific earphones break ? Or at least are about to ? I have tried 7 different eaphones and headphones . Some of those earphones ' cable broke right off . For the behind the neck headphones , i got one that broke at 3 points ( superglued them , but gave up on the 3rd when it broke at the neck ) , and 3 of them couldn't be heard in 1 of the sides ( L ) , i think because the L like thing that connects the plug and cable broke connection .. so are these headphnes about to break , or did break ?  
1	  Bought IPOD 15GB for my daughter . After 2 months the LCD cracked without any accidental injury to the unit . Apple refuses to provide service under warranty claiming the damage could not possibly be due to defect . They will repair it for $ 250 which coincidentally is the price of a new unit . Based on this " superior " customer support , I would advise against buying any Apple product .  
1	  This product has received some good reviews , but I have to say I don't recommend it if you 're not a very savvy geek who enjoys assimilating lots of byzantine technical detail . The manual is laughably filled with IEE 802.11B jargon that you 're supposed to be paying THEM to simplify for you . Alas , they think you 've signed up for a Master 's level course in electrical engineering . When you click the Help button in their software , it brings up boxes that say ' Paste the help text here . ' Don't you just love paying for unfinished software ? Get another brand , I 'd say . There is a paucity of support information on the Linksys site , and what is there is only really readable by engineers . When you call their tech support , they are brusque and say they 'll have someone call you back . Ha !

2	  It does what a switch is supposed to do . I 've had it almost a year and have not had any trouble with this device . I forget it is there doing its job .  
2	  I bought this because of the video review the previous buyer made and he was so right ! I love this keyboard and mouse combo , and it came with the batteries , too . So easy to start using with the little " plug in " it came with .  
1	  I had this computer for 3 months . At first I was satisfied with the preformance aside from the endless built in pop-up . Then the cd writer started malfunctioning so I was unable to save many files . Then it overheated and destroyed the hard drive ( and unsaved files ) . Technical support was a joke unless you enjoy calling India and trying to understand or being understood by the ESL boys . HP refused to replace this lemon , only offered to repair it if I wanted to take it to a delivery pick up , wait 2 weeks then be waiting at home whenever it was returned so I could sign for it . I 'm embarrased to say this is my second purchase from hp and I had enless problems with the first computer I bought . But theirtechnical support was much better 7 years ago .  
1	  The LCD screen broke shortly after purchase and on a radio this user un-friendly , it was almost unusable . A few months later , the volume got stuck at the highest level than it just stopped playing . Avoid this piece of junk .  
2	  It doesn't look like much , but it looks great and protects my 160 GB iPod Classic perfectly . Be aware of the following : a ) Despite the product description , it cannot use an iTrip transmitter that attaches from the bottom . It just doesn't snap in all the way . You would need to also buy an iPod dock extender ( SendStation makes one ) . b ) Headphone jack is exposed , but certain headphones plugs may not work because they cannot seat properly . c ) No clip . I had to buy a second case to use it at the gym . d ) Case backing is smooth plastic , so it will slide across your dashboard .  
2	  UNA VEZ MAS NIKON SE DESTACA , EXCELENTE PESO , PRECIO Y RENDIMIENTO . SERIA BUENO QUE LA DISTANCIA FOCAL FUESE MAS CERCANA , Y QUE AMAZON TUBIESE PAGINA EN ESPA & Ntilde ; OL  
1	  After doing a lot of research on the Net , I thought ; " ok the lighting is not good and the display is dark , but a lot of people really liked the camera " , plus Radio Shack has them on sale this week .. Well I should have taken these reviews more seriously . I bought the Fuji 2800 camera to replace my old trusted Kodak 240 digital camera . I wanted better zoom and a newer camera with the cool new features . What I got was a camera that did not take low light pictures very well at all and many of my pictures were out of focus . You might say , well I can live with the low light , I COULD NOT ! I need a camera that produces quality pictures regardless of light . And my pictures were fuzzy . NOT good Fuji ! Did you rush this one out the door or what . After calling Fuji 's Customer service they told me that I had a defective product and to return it . ( Being in denial I thought , maybe I was doing something wrong , because this camera had the zoom I really wanted . ) I did not really want to look at another Fuji after that dissappointing ordeal ..  
1	  Does not work with The 4040 unit . Do not watse your money on this product .  
1	  Sure , they were only a penny a piece when I bought them but still , I should have gotten what was advertised - HDMI cables that worked . Only one out of 4 cables worked on any of my equipment . The fourth cable works only on my satellite tv box , but nothing else . I continue to believe that no @ ! % * $ cable is worth anywhere near $ 60 and up . Wire is wire ; I 'm sure there are reasonably priced HDMI cables ( like for under $ 10 ) that work and meet HDMI 1.3 high speed specs just as well as the $ 100 + Monsters . This ain't one of them .  
2	  I love the RCA751 outdoor antenna . It works great . But the transformer it comes with is a piece of junk ; many reviews for this antenna will verify that the bundled transformer is poorly made . This transformer has gold plated leads on both sides and the plastic sheathing feels more secure than the old transformer that I removed . Signal quality of my picture is still crystal clear . This is an excellent upgrade to the stock transformer . A MUST BUY IF YOU WANT TO SETUP AN HDTV ANTENNA ON YOUR HOUSE .. you use HDMI cables , RG6 cable , and you won't spend 3 bucks on a high quality transformer to make it all work ?  
1	  Even though my HP printer manual says this should work with an iPad , it doesn't recognize the HP 6310 All-in-One Officejet printer . Therefore I feel like my money was wasted unless someone can tell me what went wrong .  
1	  I purchased this to replace my Monster brand cassete converter . I used it on my iPhone 4 on a 2004 Inifiniti G35x and decided to get a new one because the Monster one produced an irritating screaching / interference type noise which was difficult to get rid of . However , when I put in the Belkin Cassette Adapter , it didn't play any bass . Not that the bass was bad or not enough of it .. it completely left it out . I swapped b / w the Monster and the Belkin to check a few songs and played with the settings on my car , but the Belkin just didn't produce any bass . The sound quality was horrible . Returning .  
1	  I got this unit and tried using it to clean my lens , using the brush end added grease to my lens . After reading reviews , one of them said that it maybe a counter fit . The other side seems to work fine . I saw a piece of lint in the viewfinder so I tried using the brush to brush it away . When I looked through , not only did it get worse because the brush fibers fell off , now it left a greasy smear on the view finder . I called Canon about my T3i , and it has to be sent in for repair . After reading more about how to clean the view finder , it was safer to send it to the service center to have it done professionally . It is just sad that I will be without my camera for the duration of the repair . Don't make the same mistake I do . If you are going to use it , use it only for the front of the lens . Where at least you can clean the greasy residue off .  
1	  for the first year it worked great , I formatted it into an NTFS format since it came in FAT32 . It worked in regular usb2 speed , nothing over the top . and after about a year it started giving me an unreadable error , so each time I wanted to use it it asked me format the flash drive , which I kept doing over and over again in hope to see a change , but nothing happened , it kept giving me the same problem . and when it didnt , It was giving me the problem when I was trying to plug the flash drive on a different computer , so it was either only recognized on my PC , and not working on others , or unreadable on any PC at all ( including mine ) . I 've decided to stop using it , its a shame , I bought this when it was around $ 23.99 ( 16GB ) . Wont recommend it , very untrustworthy , luckily I backed up the data I had before the " unreadable error " began .  
1	  I did not purchase this item through Amazon , but will venture a review . When received ( April 08 ) the tripod had a damaged mounting plate ; this was not the fault of the vendor or the shipping process , it was obviously defective from the manufacturer . The vendor ( B & H ; photo ) replaced the damaged piece at no cost . I rarely use a tripod ( hand held and monopod are my preferred styles ) but I have a shoot coming up in a couple of days that requires a tripod . I decided to do a test setup before venturing to the shooting site - and the bolt that secures the vertical slide snapped completely off with the bolt end remaining in the tripod socket . This was not a case of overtightening - I was in the process of loosening the bolt when it snapped . No tools were used , it was " finger loosen " only . It appears that the bolt may have crystalized . The tripod will have to be sent back to the U.S. service provider ( Manfrotto ) for repairs . I had to purchase a replacement tripod ( Manfrotto XL190B ) from my local camera store . The features of the Gitzo are very nice and it is very stable ; I 've had no problems with the tripod legs in my ( admittedly ) limited usage of the tripod . However bolts should NOT break off of tripods - that 's an easy way to do serious damage to the mounted camera and / or lens ; it is absolutely unacceptable for such a thing to occur . The entire reason for having a tripod is stability and security . That being the case I cannot recommend this particular product . Of course it is very possible that I got a " lemon " and that the vast majority of the units are fine . The fact remains , however , that tripods MUST be dependable 100 % of the time , and quality control at the manufacturer must be monitored very closely .  
2	  Not a single one were defective . All burned at 8X with a NEC 3500 drive . And judging by what others say on the Internet about this media , I think this the one to buy .  
2	  I was present at a Microsoft Windows Portable Media Center introduction in San Jose this summer . After the presentation and Q & A ; had ended , I had the privelidge of taking one of the three WPMC devices for a spin , the Samsung YEPP YH-999 , which will debut along with the Creative WPMC product between late September and early October . Holding the YH-999 was a surprise for me ; based on pictures , I had been expecting a device much larger . However , Samsung surprised me with the packaging efficiency of this device , I was easily able to wrap fingers around it , and would effortlessly fit into a small-normal sized pants pocket opening . I also appreciated the slenderness of the YH-999 , however , there is a downside to this , addressed later on . The actual O / S itself is quite similar in appearance and function to Microsoft 's Media Center , albeit slightly less intricate . It isn't in any way less user friendly or adequate than MCE ; it is simply less substantial , which many will appreciate . One feature that I particularly enjoyed on the WPMC was how well interweaved the music player and photo album features are . Playing a music-accompanied slideshow is a seamless procedure , one that I would find particularly useful at family get-togethers or business venues that demand an attractive , well executed result that the WPMC so effectively delivers . I was also impressed by the quality of the video playback , as I found almost no discernable quality differences between it and a portable DVD player ; however , I am still skeptical if the YH-999 will deliver the same quality in a high-demands home theater environment . I found the buttons and controls were idiot-proof , the ham-fisted included . The single feature that was icing on the cake for me was the 5-band sound equalizer that Microsoft incorporates in the software . Anyone who owns an iPod can't ignore the lackluster sound quality the device delivers , especially on Audiophile level headphones . Microsoft appears to have taken note with the inclusion of this feature . One feature I think that few will have a use for is the TV playback feature . A Microsoft Windows Media Center Edition with DVR setup is required to capture the TV show format the WPMC will play . Most households don't own MCE PCs , which will render this feature almost pointless unless Microsoft adds a TVR feature to Windows Media Player 10 . Now I must address the negatives of the YH-999 . Archos has a well designed A / V player out that has a whopping 80GB hard drive , the Samsung Yepp YH-999 is being introduced with a paltry 20GB of storage space , and costs 100 $ more than an Archos 20GB A / V player . Another fault that almost all portable A / V players suffer from is miserable battery life . If I wanted to watch a movie on a flight from New York to L.A , I 'd be left high and dry less than half way through the flight . I would sacrifice some space to get better battery life . Also , the YH-999 doesn't support any sort of audio or video recording , which should be a no-brainer on a device of this caliber . Finally , I was unimpressed with the lack of support for different file types . The ubiquitous DivX format , which is supported by the YH-999 's various competitors , is conspicuously absent from the YH-999 's list of supported file formats . Although I don't doubt that an enterprising third party software company will create a solution to this issue , Microsoft is only being self-defeating in its quest to universalize its own file formats and applying it to the WPMC . For those that need the latest and greatest , I 'd say look long and hard at this product , but don't ignore the competition . The YH-999 is very effective at performing a multitude of tasks ; however , it isn't without drawbacks . Also , I 'd be willing to bet that Samsung , Creative , iRiver , and any other company that will make WPMC based products aren't going to offer only 20GB storage capacity for long , if they want their products to be a success . That means the YH-999 will receive a dramatic price cut when these larger capacity models debut , and based on the current standards for portable A / V storage space , the larger capacity models can't be far off . Also , based on their past and hints given by the WPMC program director , they will do yearly overhauls of the WPMC software which will require updated hardware . I think the A / V market will experience an explosion in interest and sales once these products go on sale , which will result in a more rapid refinement of the products , along with price cuts . If you don't feel a burn to purchase a WPMC right now , wait . The battle among portable a / v player companies is just starting .  
1	  I bought a pair of these radios six months ago and I had trouble with them right away . The " on " button on one of the units only worked some of the time . Then last week both units stopped working . I replaced the batteries with new ones and they still don't work . I bought these because I thought they were a good deal but I guess it 's true that you get what you pay for .  
1	  These are by far the worst headphones I have ever owned . I got them because they are from a good brand and look nice . After a week of using them the sound in the right ear bud started to lower and sometimes would just go out . I changed the battery for the headphones many times and the sound was still no good . Another annoying thing about these headphones is that in the middle of the cord the plastic box for the battery hangs down , it weighs too much on your ears and is a hassle to carry around or find a place for .  
1	  I never receved this product from suplyer so there can be no review at this time will try in a month or two might have by then .  
1	  I bought this battery as a cheaper option to the Canon replacement battery for my PowerShot SD880IS . The battery charged up fine in the charger that came with my camera . However , when I put the battery in the camera , I got the message : " Replace battery pack " . Comparing side-by-side to the Canon battery , it looks similar except that the metal contacts on the Lenmar are a bit more recessed than the ones on the Canon . It 's probably due to this that my camera won't take the Lenmar ( incomplete contact with the camera contacts ) . Overall , I can't give this a good review since it didn't work in my camera , even though it was supposed to be an equivalent to the Canon battery .  
2	  It took me a while to figure out how the strap configured in it 's multiple configurations - but once I did - it 's easy . Only odd thing is there is no internal sleeve / divider for the laptop . Since I keep my 13 " MacPro in a sleeve already - not a horrible issue , but - it 's been an adjustment . I also purchased the skooba cable caseSkooba R750-300 Cable Stable DLX ( Black ) - which has proven invaluable - although a bit pricey . The real test was taking this case on my BMW R1100RS - and this is where the bum bum positioning along with the stabilization strap make this great - it sits right back on the seat - almost like a sissybar - and doesn't shift or move . The weight isn't on my back - so when I 'm riding a distance , it 's comfortable . I like the looks of this bag a lot - but the construction is really first class which is more important . I get the feeling I could load this up with a lot of weight and the straps would all hold fine ( I had my old Triple 5 Soul bag rip a strap at a trade show - had it re-stitched and it lasted 8 years after ) . It 's not an orthodox place to carry your load - but , as a former grunt who used to hump a ruck with a radio , I can tell you that when hiking - having the weight up high makes things easier - but , for riding - the opposite holds true .  
1	  When I bought this item , it said I am eligible for the free shipping , but I don't know why it still charges me some extra money  
2	  This is one of the best socket 754 chips available . The venice core improves the heat issue , so it runs very cool . And clocked at 2.4Ghz , makes this comparable to a 939 / AM2 3500 + in most games !  
2	  1st , The service was speedy and acurate no problems plus the prices are good . 2nd , The smartmedia card adapter worked but not for the Casio Keyboard which was what I needed it for . I agree with other reviewers that it 's because of the size of the XD card you use .  
2	  I needed an extension cord with 3 prongs for my tv , as it sits high on a shelf , so I could plug it into the electric surge protector strip and this one fit the bill ! It works just fine , so I have no negatives to say about it . It also arrived quickly !  
1	  I got an iPod mini last in 04 for Christmas . It was so awesome then ! So pretty and good-working . Then about 2 months later i carried it around with me in my backpack in a special little makeup bag type thing and it didn't hold up very well even though i didn't move around a whole lot . Well i opened the bag up to listen to it on the bus and the entire screen looked awful ! There was a HUGE crack line down the front and the screen had an awful weird blackish line down it and a few tiny black lines too . I was shocked because i thought it would hold up better ! So luckily I got a replacement . But then about 4 months after i got the replacement , the battery life slowly dwindled down to about 1 and a half - 2 hours ! I was on a plane for vacation and it died halfway through the flight ! I brought my charger with me and charged it at the hotel , though . But i turned it on to listen to it , only to find that it only played 4 songs ! The 4 songs just happened to be the only ones on my iPod that i didn't buy and my friend later told me ( after i got home ) that i needed to plug it in the computer to fix that problem . But i didn't have my PC with me on vacation , obviously . And i don't have a laptop . So yes . I did that and it was all better ! But as soon as i plugged it in my other charger and took it off after it was fully charged , it did the same thing again ! So unfortunately i have to live with it that way and take off my purchased music , otherwise , it 's just wasted space . So I 've ended up with an iPod that : - Can only last for 2 hours - Skips over all my purchased music and plays only non-purchased music - Takes 4 hrs to charge but only plays 2 hrs ! So it 's pretty much obsolete in my mind . I am sort of weary to buy the Nano , seeing as how it has had lawsuits filed on account of it , because of the easily crackable screen and it 'd probably snap in my pocket . I am kinda leaning toward the video iPod even though it 's huge and i 'll never need 30 GB of music . But if i bought a battery pack for my iPod mini , it 'd cost me an extra 80 or 90 bucks and it 'd be double the size it is now , so why don't i just get a brand spanking new one ? I don't know . Apple is just sort of .. mm . So many problems ! and since Apple makes you pay like 100 bucks for insurance and warranties and stuff it 's like what 's the point ? I 'm basically banking on the fact that it 'll blow . Oh well . I don't know what to do . I have a useless iPod on my hands ! Whoopie !  
2	  Considering that my camera came with a lens that has almost the same focal length ( my kit lens is the EFS 18-55 3.5-5.6 IS ) , I was wondering if this lens was really worth the shocking price . It took all of one afternoon to convince me just how much better this lens is . I still think that the lens is on the pricey side , but performance wise this is an L lens . Images are stunningly sharp , and colors are fantastic . Wide open it produces beautiful bokeh , and because it is a fast lens you can use it indoors as well as out-doors . Since the 17-55 mm range ( since it only can be used on a 1.6 FOV body , it 's actually a 27-88 mm lens ) covers my favorite focal length ( 35-50mm ) it is my favorite walk-about lens . Wide-angle shots ( especially inside buildings ) are handled equally well as portraits by this lens . Compared to my kit lens - well , there really is no comparison . The fixed 2.8 aperture through the whole focal range alone puts the kit lens to shame . Mounted on a 450D this lens produces a nicely balanced composition that is easy to handle . AF is quick and silent , and the image stabilisator helps to steady those shots that otherwise would require a larger aperture . As with the kit lens , it can't do miracles , though , as too many marginal pictures unfortunately prove ( I should have upped the ISO on those ) . The much larger ( compared to the kit lens ) body is easier to operate , and frankly , also looks better . The 77mm filter thread may be an annoyance to you if you don't have any other lens with that size , as you have to purchase new filters and can't share them with other lenses ( most of my other lenses , not being L type , have 58mm threads ) . Although the barrel extends with zoom , it does not turn during zooming , nor during focusing . This helps a lot when you are shooting outdoors with a circular pol filter and have to get the right focal length fast . Although the lens has a nice weight ( 650g ) , I am a bit disappointed that the barrel is made from plastic instead of metal - I would expect that a lens with this price tag would have a quality feel to match . The plastic does feel a bit cheap . I 'm also disappointed that this lens did not come with a lens hood . Again , at that price I would expect these things to be included . When deciding to purchase this lens it is important to also consider the fact that this lens is an ' EF-S ' type and will only work on 1.6FOV cameras , not on full frame bodies . It will therefore stay with your 1.6 should you get a full body later . Personally , I think it is an excellent lens , and I happily recommend it to anyone who shoots in the same focal range .  
2	  I have had a huge number of backpacks over the years , and one thing I can ; t stand anymore is a cheep one . This is one of the most rugged and stylish I have had . I think that this even beats Tumi bags . ( My previous bag was a Tumi which gave out in the zipper when I stuffed it full ) I particularly like this bag because of it 's heavy duty zippers for the large pockets , the metal reinforced top handle and it 's decent size and exapandability . This is a very rugged pack with lots of pockets . Two large ones with part of one of those with a padded slot with strap for your laptop . A top pocket for your MP3 Player and headphones . Lot 's of small pockets and places for your pens . It 's also padded nicely on the back , and has shock absorbing straps . Note this bag also comes in black , which I would have preferred , ( it 's just more professional looking ) but the red is nice too .  
1	  after i got the subs i hooked them up in my blazer come to find out one of the subs were ALREADY BLOWN ! i know you get what you pay for but dam atleast give me something that works cuz this aint doing it . my word DO NOT GET THIS P.O.S on the other hand the one kicks hard and it looks good ( do to mirror on floor of box ) with my neon lights . to save you the trouble and head ach spend the extra 100 get good subs and be happy . looks-8 sound-7 the product - - 10 hope this helps you .  
2	  I purchased this item in 2001 and I have not had any problems with it at all . It works fabulously and I use it all the time . It was worth every penny I spent for it . Good job HP .  
2	  HP software has long driven me crazy . Hp hardware , on the other hand , almost always works well . My Designjet 130NR was a reasonably priced solution for a small design office . The ink cartridges last a long time . Good product .  
2	  Although it 's a bummer that the hp officejet d135 is designed with the printheads and inkcartridges separate ( so they have to be replaced sperately ) this product was a cinch to install . Printheads on this model of the officejet typically last about three years and are as easy to replace as an ink cartridge .  
1	  I bought this toy last Christmas for my then 9 year old daughter . She loved it but was frustrated that its recording time / photo capacity is so small and the quality of the picture is sub-par . It eats batteries like crazy and inexplicably just stopped working after a few months . Much too expensive for the actual quality , especially when you can buy a real digital hand cam now for a few hundred dollars . If this toy had cost around $ 30.00 I would have given it a great review .  
1	  Don't buy this scanner . I 'm a light user , and this scanner failed after 18 months . The software was okay , the hardware quit working after the warranty expired , and the scanner unit needs to be replaced by a repair center . It 's so costly , the repair is not worth it . Do yourself a favor and go with another brand .  
1	  Battery life is very short , software is slow and when it goes out of charge you lose all the data ( except what 's in the memory card ) and you have to reinstall the software . On top of that BE AWARE that if you have any problem after 90 days , you will have to buy a new Palm ( if you like the idea ) since the repairing costs are $ 125 + $ 39.99 + taxes . To call the Technical Assistance you have to add $ 25 . My Palm after only 8 months does not turn on anymore and since batteries are non-user replaceable Lithium , my only option is to buy a new PDA , NEVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE A PALM.A lot of other clients had my same problem and this could really be a defective product . I want to underline the outstanding quality of Amazon 's Customer Service , not responsible for the insulting low quality of this product . It will be a great pleasure for me to keep make my purchases on this site and I suggest it to all my friends .  
1	  I guess I 'm the only one that has had a bad experience with this product . The card worked for the first video I transfered but quit working after that . I had to return it for a refund .. However the editing software that came with it was very easy to use .  
2	  The product was excellent and the whole experience was great . I knew what the product was like since I had one already . Great product as well .  
2	  This manufactured ink is great . Buy an empty ink cartridge for under $ 20 , and you can refill it for under $ 10 .. saves you hundreds a year if you are a heavy printer or a college student and have to write a lot of papers . If you are just a casual printer , then it won't make too much difference . The one main problem is that the printer indication ( the stuff that pops up as you print to let you know of any problems and status of printing ) will read " Black ink is low . Click below now to order a new cartridge from Lexmark " . Well , I don't like popups and reminders annoy me , not to mention i have little patience , and i can personally handle it . To me , it 's better to close reminder popups and save money each year , than to overspend and avoid the popups . ( I heard on a forum that if you put your regular tape on the left side of the contacts - as you are looking at the cartridge and at the side of the orangish contact strip facing the back of the printer - the popups will stop . Your printer will register a question mark on the ink , but it will still print without nagging reorder messages )  
1	  Here is how you can save a ton of money : 1 . Do not buy this Ink . 2 . Throw away your Sharp fax or printer ( actually smash it so no other poor sole finds it and gets into the same trap ) . 3 . Buy something else that does not need $ 34 ink for every 50 pages you print . I have used this ink catridge and I am really-really disappointed .  
2	  I already owned the Bose Sound Dock , which certainly provides power to bring the music on your iPod to life .. well , this system is truly room - even house-filling . And it 's got the dynamic range to reach more longer distances . The amp provides a really intense depth and reach to the overall sound . Ever since I bought the iPod , I dreamt of finding a way to make it my main music system .. well , that 's what the iFi does ! I do not use anything but this system in my home anymore ! And for what you get .. the price is great . Yes , the remote is tiny , very basic and difficult to handle , but a minor quibble overall .  
1	  Most electronics in my home are from SONY . But , this time I am so disappointed with the purchase at Sonystyle . Com . 1 ) When I opened the computer , the computer can not be started . I spend much much time to call the custom service . Unfortunately the custom service is very difficult to be reached . 2 ) It gave a lot of difficulties to return this big stuff . So I decided to send it to a SONY authorized Service Ctr . There is only 1 in Massachusetts . It needs 7 bussiness days to repair - Oh , my god ! 3 ) Rebate cheating :( .. ) . 4 ) No computer manuals , no software manuals , no recovery discs ( you need to buy it ! ) with the computer . You need to spend much time to call them for every detail . So bad service , which waste me a lot of time and feeling . I will never buy SONY again .  
2	  Came neatly packed and shipped promptly . You CAN actually get audio through these adapters if you 're routing a PC-peripheral connection and your PC uses an ATI card or has a SPDIF connection to transmit audio .  
2	  I love this touch lamp . It is much more modern and asthetically pleasing than the old brass touch lamps . This lamp has 3 brightness settings which come in handy in our nursery .  
2	  These headphones are wonderful . I am hearing challenged and can here music and dialog as never before when using my computer or the TV .  
1	  UPDATEI sent all 3 battery packs back shortly after writing the original review ( below ) and finally received credit today . In the meantime , I ordered , received , and am using batteries from a non-Amazon source . I highly recommend the Rayovac Maximum Cordless Phone Battery # RAYM182 . It lasts for 3 to 4 hours of talk time , recharges quickly , and doesn't get hot . I wish I had just ordered them originally and saved all the hassle . ORIGINALI received 3 of these replacement battery packs in early January . They are significantly inferior to the original batteries for this phone and significantly inferior to a replacement set I ordered in 2010 . I have 5 TRU8866 phones . I work from home and am on the phone many hours each day . I ordered these batteries as replacements for the 3 phones I use the most . The first thing I noticed was that these battery packs are physically smaller than my older ones : 1.7 " vs 2.0 " . I thought , well , they probably made them smaller and better . Nope . After 2 months of use , they last less than half as long as the old ones , even after being fully charged overnight .  
1	  The only thing that takes a trip is the ITRIP.I have bought 3 , 2 for friends and one for me . Mine I have returned once for a replacent and now thereplacement doesn't work . One of my friend 's ITRIP alsostopped working .  
2	  Completely satisfied . Excellent product which is exactly what I have come to expect from Amazon .  
1	  I have a 1.7gig P4 running XP and found this product to be very unstable which is a nice way to say it doesn't work . The hardware would always hang my computer no matter which software I used with it . Also a note to their clueless tech support , my Maxtor hard drive was the cause for the sound and video being out of sync , when I reinstalled XP using a Western Digital drive the sync problem went away but not the instability . Believe Microsoft when they say use of an unsigned driver may make your system unstable .  
2	  I have this same computer . I have had it for over 5 years . I bought it refurbished then for over a thousand with the same features and CPU . I have never had to replace a part on it . It has been hauled , rained on , dropped , ate up with viruses and nothing ever failed . I still have it and it works like new even now . You can't go wrong with this deal for internet or personal computing .  
2	  These speakers give truly high definition audio . Being THX certified , its no surprise . The sub-woofer is hyperactive so I keep it at one level above minimum and it blends in perfectly with the sound . The sound card connecters are not very good and at the first shot I ended up getting sound only from 3 speakers and the subwoofer . Then after pressing the connectors in harder they clicked properly into place and the sound was perfect . I 've read some reviews online that state that these speakers emit a hissing sound even when not being used . I was able to get rid of that problem by using lower impedance cables from the sub-woofer to the speakers . Also , using optical connection makes the music sound way better . To give you some idea of the power of the speakers , let me tell you this - I live on the first floor of my building and have a friend who 's on the fourth floor . I was able to wake him up from sleep just by turning the volume to 3/4th the full . He thought there was an earthquake . Now that 's something really amazing .  
2	  Worked exactly as expected , long enough to reach where i wanted in the room and good overall display . Five stars  
2	  YO ! This camera is just perfect for those getting into photogrophy ! Although im only 14 years old , I know what i 'm talking about . I have had this camera for 3 weeks now and it is just inspirational . I got into photogrophy from Transworld Skateboarding Magazine . The photogrophers have amazing pics ! Truly inspirational ! I 'm leaving for christmas to go to England next week and can't wait to shoot some nice pics . I tend to favor fast action pics . With Al Servo ( funtion automatically set in sports mode ) i can just point and shoot and the camera automatically adjusts the focus of the object during the pictures . I love to customize . The easiest customization setting that i always use for outdoor action pics is the Tv mode . This mode allows you to customize the shutter speed . First make sure you are in a bright lighted area to ensure fast shutter speed . The brighter the area is the faster the shutter speed you can set . I like to hold down the shutter button for a rapid fire of 3 frames per second . Awesome ! I love the sound of instant photos . I cannot even descride what it is like . Try it out ! The T2 is a great camera for begginers at a great price . Remember this review is only a " guideline " . It would be good to make a decision on your own . If you try hard and can't come to a decision , that is when you can rely on other peoples opinions . If you want to see some cool pics from the magazine ( .. )  
1	  These battery 's are a piece of junk . Please do no buy them . They went dead in less an month . Please go with the original canon battery 's , its worth the time and money .  
1	  Do not buy this item if you plan to use it continuously . It fell apart after about 2 months of use ( 50 plug-in plug-out cycles ) . It worked well originally , but soon the HDMI part of the adapter started bending and eventually fell out .  
2	  Bought two of them for vacation to DC . When they arrived one was dead and would not even charge , contacted the seller and they sent a new one in 3 days . Both batteries work great , hold a long charge , and took the DC heat walking the streets for 7-9 hours a day for the entire week . Only had to recharge one time for each battery all week . Would buy again no issues or reservations !  
1	  Works fine for the first couple of months but as I read in other reviews , the left click button begins to stick and act as if you 're holding it down while you scroll . Picking the thing up off the desktop by about an inch and dropping it can shock the button lose , but it 's only a matter of time - just a few clicks - until it happens again . Sad , because overall it 's a nice device but as with so many manufacturers , poor quality to save a buck has doomed their product to be merely mediocre at best .  
1	  I bought two of these .. one broke down .. can't turn it on .. I tried calling the customer service .. emailed .. etc .. but NO ANSWER ! I just tried again .. but their voicemail box is FULL ! JUST REMEMBER ! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE !  
1	  We own a small home based video production business and thought that this DVD recorder would be an excellent addition for providing DVD 's to customers that requested them . However , it fails during recording about 1 of 3 dvd 's and unless you are watching the screen at the time , you will not know it until the finished product is watched and a screen freezes or jumps ahead about 3-4 minutes into the program . There is absolutely no mention what-so-ever of these error messages in the book so there is no chance of trying to correct it . We have tried 5 differant manufacturers of DVD blanks both + RW and + R and it doesn't make any differance . As I said , unless you are staring at the display at the time the error occurs , there is no indication that it happened , so we have sent out batches of 40 and 50 dvd 's only to get 25-30 returned from our " un-happy " customers . It is unrealistic to stare at the machine while recording 50 copies so I 'd call that a problem . There is also an odd feature that allows you to somehow change the configuration of a recorded DVD to be compatible with certain players but there is no explaination as to what is happening to the DVD when you perform this " magic " step so one cannot determine a useful way to implement the option . When it worked , it was very easy to use . But it is way too un-reliable and un-documented for any serious user . Based on others comments , this is a common problem with the unit . ( if anybody wants a good deal )  
1	  The worst constructed filter I 've seen in my life time . Extremely thick . Its light weight makes me doubt if it is really made from glass . The mount ring can move sidewards for about 1mm apart from the glass ring , because it is made from a piece of plastic [ .. ] When mounted on lens , it is really too loose to keep it from dancing . It 's already full of dust between the glass ring and the mounting ring before I took it out from the shipping box , which make rotating a painful feeling . Avoid any rotation needed filter made by Tiffen ! Perhaps , any filter from Tiffen . Go B + W or Heliopan , they won't cost you much more but you 'll see what a truly beautiful filter should look like . [ .. ]  
2	  I have a one year old laptop that I 've been using for work . When I run another OS on the internal disc drive , it heats up my laptop considerably . I want this machine to last longer , so I decided to invest in a laptop cooler . Word of mouth is that this Antec is the best for your money if you have a modest budget to work with . I 've been using it for about a month now and I 'm impressed with it . Setting it up was as easy as plugging it into a free usb port and then plunking the laptop on top of it . It has two fan speeds ; I use the higher speed when I 'm logging into my alternative OS and the regular speed for normal computing . My laptop stays nice and cool . The cooler comes with optional rubber buttons that you can use to ensure that the laptop doesn't slide around on top of the device . Even if you forgo the buttons , using this device will change the physical profile of your rig a bit , so if you 've already got your desk or stand situated for ideal height , expect to adjust it after setting up the cooler . There is a glowing blue light that comes on to let you know the cooler is on and running . If it bugs you , you can easily cover it with a piece of tape . Bottom line : if you can snap this up at the sale price , do it . It 's as good as you 've heard .  
1	  Not a good value . Product is thin plastic and has inferior components . As stated above the tuning dial is not digital rather old analogue tune it to your station and watch the digital display guess what station you are tuning to . It does have weather band a nice touch but not NOAA weather alert and you need to tune that in also as it is analogue as well . The AM / FM did pull in a few radio stations and offered a coaxial antenna input . The remote is CD function only ! Over all sound and function is not worth the price paid . I would expect the MSRP to be @ 25.00 USD . That would be more appropriate . This one is getting RETURNED . I hear for the same price paid Kohl 's Dept store has one and I have seen / heard it at a friends house and it is worth the $ less than 50 . Live and Learn GPX = cheap quality and misleading advertising on the box .  
1	  Lots of coasters ! I contacted Verbatim with no response . Awful product support ! I 'm using a new Dell 18x burner using Nero 's newest version . Stay away !  
1	  If you in the market for a $ 300 paper weight that looks like a DVD recorder this is the product for you ! If not , stay away from this product ! After having numerous problems including , frequent crashes , recording problems , media issues , and finally a terminal lock up that could not be remedied , I decided to have a look at the inside of this thing . Much to my disbelief this thing even looks bad on the inside with some very sloppy assembly ( I bought it new with a factory seal ) . I am astounded that this low-quality product ever made the mainstream market . It is a piece of junk fresh out of the box and I recommend avoiding it at any cost !  
1	  I swear my life 's quest has been finding a pair of suitable headphones / earphones to excercise in . I saw these and I thought .. oh SONY ! Perfect . Except no . The entire time I ran / moved I spent with my hand on my ear to ensure the bud wouldn't fall out . They were so bad . This is probably my 8th pair this year . Maybe one day I will find some headphones ..  
2	  Works amazingly well for the low price point . My Phenom 's cores haven't ever gone past 150ish , even with a full load . And that 's using the standard heatsink-fan combo provided by AMD . More than enough for numerous applications , too ! Awesome Product !  
1	  Either I bought a lemon or it 's not the best product . This DVD player just stopped working 2 weeks after purchase . However , Sony has a decent return policy and a re-furbished one is on it 's way . We 'll see how this one performs , hopefully I 'll be changing my review . TIP : Spend a little more and get a step or two " better " DVD player .  
2	  I recently bought a rio cali and there hasn't been a problem yet . I 've gone through quite a few mp3 players and this one doesn't seem that bad compared to some . The display is good . The controls are good . But the design isn't the best . I don't know what inspired Rio to put the headphone jack at he bottom side ofthe player . The battery cover does seem a little flismy so you need to becareful with it or it seems like it will break . The software is fairly easy to use . I could easily pull the songs i wanted from a directory and transfer it to the player . I haven't encountered any glitches so far .  
1	  I bought this kit for my 06 sonata . Big mistake , I tried to install this scosche kit and my single din head unit wouldnt even fit in the hole . I had to trim the edges to get it to fit . The box just barely clips in so if you push too hard it falls back a little . I couldnt stand the way it fit so I trashed it and bought a metra kit . Couldnt be happier with it . It 's actually made to fit your car , no universal crap . So do yourself a favor and spend the extra couple dollars to buy a metra kit so that it fits the right way with no hassle .  
1	  The title says it all . I had most of the problems others had except that I didn't have the problem with the batteries not fitting . My main objection is that this mouse eats batteries . I 'm replacing them about every 2 weeks , sometimes more . The reason I have to do this seems to be that the light doesn't turn off when the mouse is idle so it burns the batteries up . Otherwise it 's ok . I keep in a drawer just in case something happens to one of the other mice . Just some advice - don't let it get too far from the mini-receiver and if it stops working check to see if the mini-receiver has been hit and lost contact with the computer - the way it sticks out makes that easy to happen . Mine did not have the battery not fitting problem but because of how cheaply made these items are it was more luck than design .  
2	  Works great when you do not have a wireless laptop . Highly recomended ..  
1	  I bought these horrible sounding ear-buds from a vendor who sells on Amazon . Be very wary of buying from Amazons affiliates , you can get burned . These supposedly Sennheiser CX300-B headphones are piece of junk Chinese back alley knockoffs . And extremely dull and muffled sounding knockoffs at that . Try tin cans and a string before you buy , these things from an Amazon associate . unless you know of them . And their reputation for square dealing .  
1	  The mouse is an antique . Too many cables . How do they still sell it ? They should sell it for $ 0.50 .  
1	  Not a bad headset but as far as noise reduction .. nada . But as the old saying goes , you get what you pay for .  
1	  I 've been searching for a decent pair of headphones to use while running and settled on these as they were the only ones available at the various stores in my neighborhood . They work just fine , but are very flimsy and because of that are prone to snapping in half ( which mine did within 2 weeks ) . I 'm now searching the web to find a better pair , but would recommend you stay away from these as the plastic parts are just to weak and prone to breaking .  
2	  A few of the tops had some minor surface defects , but I didn't order them for their beauty . They hold my CDs & DVDs adequately in paper envelopes and are much more convenient than 3-ring binder CD / DVD pages . Assembly was a snap ( sorry for the pun ) .  
2	  Belkin is known for delivering good products at decent prices . This product is no exception . I highly recommend it for those who need to move away Monitor , KB and Mouse from CPU . Long and sturdy . Very high quality .  
2	  This RAM cooler is good for any 184 pin , 4 slot configuration of SDRAM . Installationis relatively straight-forward . I got the instructions from the ThermalTake website , which gives you Detail Specificatons , and Assembly Views . [ .. ] I installed it in an older Gateway E-4600 P4 1.6Ghz system , which uses Rambus . This works fine , see my picture . The shields fit right over the heat spreaders of Rambusmodules . The kit includes 2 clips which you fit over the module and cooler shields . If you have SDRAM without a heat spreader , you would add the insulator strip that ismounted with double-sided tape , not removing the strip which will face towards yourmemory chips on the module . The insulator strip is mounted on the A1165 shield onthe inside of it towards the top on the flat area . Remove the module the shield withthe fan will be attached to after unplugging your system , and discharging the memorymodules by holding in the power button on the case for 20-30 seconds . Attach insulating strip on inside of the cooler shield by removing the cover strip . Do notremove the other one facing the RAM chips or all you are left with is a glue strip . Clip on the fan / shield assembly using the clips provided seating the clip over theshield into the depressed area , and over the RAM module . This fits snug once seated . Do the same procedure for the other shield that doesn't have the fan attached . Theninsert your RAM module without the fan first . Install the RAM module with the fannext . BE CAREFUL when re-installing your memory modules , making sure you press onthe bottom of the shield while inserting , and avoiding capacitors and components onthe motherboard . If you nick one of them , it 's possible to create a short and blowup your memory modules . The ' cans ' of the electrolytic capacitors have ( + ) voltageon them , and contact with the shield will cause a short ! Now you can route the 3-wire fan supply wire to your CPU motherboard plug using somekind of in-line splitter , or another fan plug on the motherboard . Mine had an extraone for the case fan I added , so I used the splitter ( Syba SY-CAB65007 ) . This madefor a very neat installation after routing and adding wire ties . The 40mm cooler fanis also replaceable if it dies later , without disturbing the rest of installation . BE CAREFUL when installing the mounting clips , that they do not come in contact withany exposed circuit parts of your memory modules . It should rest on top of the chipson the opposite side of the shield for modules without a heat spreader . The shieldsprovide minimal heat transfer . The fan does most of the work , forcing cooler air onthe modules and through the slots , and a rear case fan removes the warm air . I see adifference of - 10 to - 15C using a thermocouple attached to the Rambus spreader . Therear case fan also exhausts more warmer air now , so this does work !  
1	  I left this adapter plugged in and it quit working after 9 months . I wouldn't spend the amount of money necessary for buying the Canon-brand adapter . In fact , I 'll be purchasing an adapter , from a different maker , that will work with my Elura 100 and only costs 30 USD .  
2	  I have had my Samsung ML-2150 printer for many years , and it has printed many tens of thousands of pages . Along the way , I have tried refilled toner cartridges from time to time . They are much cheaper , but almost every such cartridge has needed replacement at least once , due to defects , poor print quality , or incompatibilities . None of the cartridges , whether OEM or aftermarket , ever yielded anything close to 8K pages ! My net : For this particular printer , at least , stick to OEM cartridges and enjoy excellent , reliable printer performance . ( I should mention that refilled cartridges work fine on my Canon inkjet . But not for my Samsung ML-2150 . )  
1	  The Rio 600 , on the outside , is very appealing and seems easy to use . However , it is , in truth , unreliable and cheap . The Rio 600 simply does not work . For Christmas , I received a Rio 600 . It worked beautifully for an hour or so , but then suddenly the sound stopped working . It was not the headphones , I tried another pair . Therefore , I returned it , thinking it was just a faulty player . I ordered and soon received my second Rio 600 . That too appeared to be working just fine . Disappointingly , when I tried to download some songs it simply would not work . Also , the MP3 player indicated that some memory was being used although there were no songs on the player . I ignored this , thinking that perhaps it was supposed to do that , and then tried to download a few songs onto the player . It simply would not work . The software on the computer showed that the MP3 player was downloading the music , but the MP3 player itself was not . These are only a few among many problems that I encountered with the Rio 600 software , alone . Obviously there are a few bugs that need to be worked out before the Rio 600 should be on the market . I see that the intent of the Rio 600 is good , but the actual product is not . I do not understand how the makers could not have noticed all of the problems with the Rio 600 . Truthfully , the Rio 600 is not all bad . The sound quality is wonderful and I adore the headphone style . Also , it is incredibly easy to use ( when it is working correctly ) . However , I would not recommend this product and I strongly discourage you from purchasing it . It seems that I am not the only one who has had problems with the Rio 600 . A few friends of mine have also bought the Rio 600 and they too have had many problems with it . In short , the Rio 600 is more trouble than it is worth .  
2	  I 've tried several from Apple to Sony . These work wonderfully and sound great . They stay in place , so once positioned you don't have to mess with them again . Great for the longer runs / workouts . Very comfortable , you forget you are wearing them . Definite must . $ 39 - $ 49 .  
1	  The outside of the case is fine but I was disappointed to find no padding of any kind inside the case to protect my computer . Consequently , I would not recommend purchasing this product .  
2	  Got this in conjunction with a Boss R1100 250W rms amp and an 8 & # 34 ; pyle subwoofer tube . I recommend all these for cheapskates who want to add some nice bass . The only issue I had was with my ground connection , but that was just because I picked a bad spot to put it the first time . Turns out a good ground is kind of important , who knew ? :) For a non-superpowered amp this kit should be totally fine . Why pay more ?  
2	  the stylus rights smooth on my pda . the pen is very good . the pencil writes very good . im very glad i got this .  
1	  I have bought a GPS StreetPilot C330 navigator which it have provided a adapter in the box . Anyway , according to their suggestion , I bought this adapter at the same time . I found it can not connect with my navigator . So this adapter is useless . if you want to buy C330 , do not waste your money on it .  
1	  It is much much louder than my laptop fan . The noise sounds like electrical one and it is amplified by the fan noise . I don't understand how other reviewers can say that it is quiet . Maybe I 've got defective one .. Anyway , the one I 've got produces unbearable noise . Of course , I returned it .  
2	  The Remote is a dream come true . Nothing this good comes without a little work . The millions of permutations of device combinations out there is staggering . The fact that a remote can do it at all blows my mind , and this one does it well for my needs . It does it even better than my original remotes . The LCD screen is so helpful for these 50 + eyes in the dark I can't tell you how nice it is to see what that button says before I push it . You may or may not need to do the following though with this remote in this order . buy it , charge it , install it , relax and meditate , find out what doesn't work , relax , fix it , relax , find out what doesn't work now , fix it , relax some more . put it down . go to bed . call customer service the next day , make a cup of coffee , play solitaire on your computer , finish your coffee .. Yes , it takes a while but I 'm telling you , you will understand why , and you will be so appreciative . Trust in Logitech it will work and it will work well !  
1	  Ok I have owned this printer dock for a while when I used it to print up pics from a trip and I was able to print a few pics then the ink ran out so I went to get another cartridge and continue then same happened . My printer is so much faster and better for this job that I have never gotten another cartridge . Save your money and use the regular printer  
2	  the initial laser range finder that i wanted , which was less expensive , was listed but them became unavailable in two different stores . Finally i chose this one and it works just as well . I used it for measuring distances in fields and mountains so it is a little too high tech for our work , but it is an excellent piece of equipment nonetheless .  
1	  The days of " 750MB " has gone . Only reason I bought this was to retrieve my archival datas stored in the 750MB cartridges . After that it is useless . It 's the time for the memory size of " GBs " and " TBs . "  
1	  its just a plain usb cable , but not the Nikon UC-E4 USB Cableif i knew , i would have just gone to chinatown and bought it there for less , and would not have had to wait for delivery  
1	  The Terk AM / FM Amplified Stereo Antenna with Gamma Loop may work in some places but it didn't work up state AZ in the mountians . It pulled in only those stations I could get before I plugged in the Terk . Sorry . I have since sold it .  
1	  When I first purchased my Coby MP3 player , I was very satisfied . I would have happily given it a " 5 " . It worked wonderfully . I have had it for about 3 or 4 months now and am starting to have many technical and other problems . First , my battery lasts about 1 hour when the player is fully charged . Second , I have a lot of trouble getting the screen sensors to register . In other words I have to push on the screen many times before it registers what I want as far as switching songs or turning down the volume . It often changes screens without my asking it to . Right now , I can not get the player off of the radio and continue to get error messages . Additionally , I purchased one for my 17-year-old son . His broke within one week . He put it in his pocket and the heat caused the screen to go black . He is not rough on his electronics .  
1	  We received the hard drive kit packed securely in a box . When opened we immediately noticed a rattle . The kit did not work . My suspicion was - it was packed not working - no apparent damage to packaging or product . We have since had to mail back to the manufacturer to get this situation resolved . Emails back and forth for the instructions to mail the drive back . We had to pick up the cost of postage , and still do not have a drive . This has been over a period of a month .  
1	  When it works , it works flawlessly . When it doesn't .. well , let 's say it isn't very pretty . Rebooting with the card reader plugged into the USB port on a Win2000 box will consistently lead to a Blue Screen of death . Reader has to be plugged in AFTER Windows boots which is a drag . Not bad overall , but there has to be better out there .  
2	  As a professional composer , I have to admit I was surprised at the clarity of these speakers . For the price , this is a great buy .  
1	  I purchased a new Samsung 22 " LCD monitor ( model 225BW ) on April 16 , 2008 . On July 13 , 2008 , my monitor failed and my first communication to Samsung about the problem was submitted through their web-based customer contact form . On July 20 , 2008 , I had received no response from Samsung and after searching their website , the easiest way to resolve this issue was to start a self-service in-warranty ticket . I completed the web form , supplying Samsung with all of the requested information as well as a copy of my sales receipt and proof-of-purchase . On July 23 , 2008 , I checked the status on the website and it showed " waiting for exchange process . " So I called the 1-800-SAMSUNG number to determine what the status was . I was told by the representative that I was impatient . She commented " It isn't like they can put a monitor in a box and send it to you . " Why not ? That was the option I selected - to have a replacement monitor shipped to The UPS Store near my home to have the exchange made and the defective monitor returned . My other option was to foot the bill for shipping and send it in for repairs , or , to have a $ 400 hold be placed on my credit card to have a unit cross-shipped and I would still be paying for shipping the defective monitor to Samsung . On July 25 , 2008 , I once again checked the status and it was still showing " waiting for exchange process . " So I called again and asked exactly what was Samsung waiting on . The representative told me that the exchange process hadn't started and that it was an automated process and that I just needed to wait . On July 28 , I called again , trying to find out exactly what was holding the process up . I was told that in-warranty monitor exchanges were handled by a third party and that the time necessary to complete the process was dependent upon their speed . I asked if I could contact them and was told no . I asked for the name of the company and was told that they couldn't give me that information . I hung up . I called back . This time , a representative told me that the delay was my fault . She said that I had not told Samsung whether I wanted " A " stock or " R " stock . I advised her that I didn't even know what that meant and said that during the self-service ticket creation process , I was never asked to make that decision . She advised that " A " stock meant a new monitor and " R " stock meant a refurbished monitor . Naturally , with my monitor just days over 3 months old , I told her I would prefer " A " stock . She then advised me that I couldn't get " A " stock and would have to settle for " R " stock . I asked why and she replied that there was no " A " stock to ship out . Upon further questioning , I determined that there was no " A " stock for this monitor because Samsung is no longer manufacturing it . OK , so if there is no " A " stock and I have to settle for " R " stock , then why would Samsung be waiting on me to make a decision ? I asked her how I was supposed to know that I needed to make a decision since there was no indication of the website when I checked the status of my ticket and the " Message from Samsung " field was blank on the ticket status screen . She said that customers usually called Samsung to ask why there was a delay and that 's when they would find out about the " A " stock or " R " stock issue . I told her that was unacceptable to expect the customer to know that and that Samsung should contact the customer if there was an issue . She responded that they were an in-bound call center and don't make outgoing calls to customers . She also replied that there was no way they would have the time to do that even if they could make out-bound calls . So , the net result of this phone call was that I would be getting " R " stock . She said she would " send it over " so that it could be processed immediately . My interpretation was that she would make whomever needed to be aware of my decision aware and have the replacement monitor shipped out . Bad assumption on my part . On July 31 , 2008 , Samsung 's Repair Self-Tracking website still shows " waiting on exchange process " as the status of my ticket . Time for another phone call . I get the same story as last time - " A " stock vs " R " stock . I explain that I have already been through this 3 days ago and that I shouldn't have to go through all of this again . For God 's sake , put the monitor in a box and send it to me . This representative advised me that she would " expedite " my ticket and get it shipped out . I asked what assurance I had that this would happen and she replied " Because I said I would . " On August 4 , 2008 , I made another call to Samsung . The representative I spoke with this time seemed genuinely concerned about my on-going problem . He transferred me to Samsung 's ECR ( Executive Customer Relations ) group . I spoke with agent 23 . She basically gave me the same old story - no " A " stock available . What exactly do I need to do here ? I thought that during the 2 prior phone calls we had established that " R " stock was my only option and I said that I would accept it . I didn't really want it but refurbished equipment is almost the universal standard for warranty requests these days . This agent did say that I could get a refund if I wanted it . I really just wanted a monitor . She said that she was going to send an email to the " monitor department " to determine if there was a new monitor ( that met or exceeded the specifications of my defective monitor ) that they could " expedite " to me and that she would call me back . She verified my phone number . It 's now August 6 , 2008 . I called the ECR again at their direct-dial number - 800-522-7341 . This time I got Agent 12 . She gave me the same old song and dance - you know the drill - " A " vs " R " and told me that was the problem . I asked how long a refund would take and was told 6 weeks . I asked to speak to a Supervisor . She said that she could refer my request to speak to a Supervisor to " Case Management " and that I would get a return call in about 5 days . 5 DAYS ! I feel like I 'm going to have a stroke . I hung up . It 's still August 6 and I have calmed down somewhat . I call ECR back and get Agent 49 . She reads the notes and indicates that Agent 23 received a reply to her email that there was no " A " stock available . I asked why she didn't call me back as promised . No explanation . Then I asked if an " R " stock unit had been shipped . No , it hadn't . We went round & round . She said that she could send an email to the " monitor group " to see if this issue " can be resolved . " She advised that she would call me back when she received a return email . More promises of return phone calls . Just for fun , I asked her who at Samsung America , Inc or Samsung Electronics America oversaw customer service operations . Her response " I will be happy to provide a mailing address for Samsung where you can send a letter to the President and express your concerns . " So , I spent money on a monitor with what I thought was a good , 3-year warranty . My money was good . The monitor is bad . Customer service is fictional and apparently there really is no warranty . This experience puts Samsung in a dead heat with HP for absolute worst customer service / customer support .

1	  OK .. been a Palm customer for a few years here . As of late , been holding onto my loyalty to palm for a few reasons : I hate Microsoft ; palm fits in my pocket , availability of accessories , and now .. color and expansion memory * sigh * . If you are one currently debating CE vs . a Palm device , read on . I recently made the switch to the new dimension in " palm " computing .. color .. the m505 , and I am totally disappointed . I feel misled by PALM for trying to debunk the negitives without addressing the issues for customers . I work in the tech industry in Silicon Valley and know a few people inside at Palm .. there is alot of damage control going there . They have lost me as a customer and many others i know . The facts are below . FIRST , accessories are not readily available for the PALM . Many are backordered .. the basics . Forget 3rd party hardware , it isnt even shipping yet . So , all those that went with the Vx and are considering sticking with the Palm for the same benefits , very few of them still exists . Another dissapearing benefit of being a palm customer that is disapearing is functionality . I mean , unless this is the first bit of research that you have done , you full well know that all the PDA 's got palm beat . In fact , I wonder what ol ' Karl ( CEO ) is doing , because his products are down right archaic all the sudden . All the things that iPAQ , Journada can do , and all palm does is the basics .. no sound for MP3 , or synching documents other than in the format that PALM wants them in . Let 's talk about the color . It ( stinks ) . Really , it is the truth . Where did they come up with the claim that it has 65,000 colors ? I had to call palm as soon as i got mine because i could only see 4 colors .. ? Also , it is very dim even with the backlight on . Not in brightness , but in richness in color . Very big disapoinment . As for the Microsoft thing .. yes , i still hate MS . Although , when you think about it , running a MS device if you are using MS on your desktop may integrate better . I have heard that the CE platform has come a long way in ironing out there bugs .. much like theyt do with all teir other software ( v1 v1.1 v1.2 , etc .. haha ) But now is is tolerable , and with all the back up cards now , who cares , you just restore data if there is a crash . Get a good warrenty and 24 hrs later you are up and runnig again . I recently had my palm crash 3 times which made me rethink my positioning . Palm sent me 3 new units , could not explain how each one was crashing , but acknoledged that it was not my fault .. also had the gaul to charge me for cross shipping each time .. the only real advantage is the size . If you have alot of money to blow , size matters , and all you need is a contact sort of datebook , then this one is for you . However , if you consider this an investment and are looking to really USE it for things to be efficient and often .. go straight to the iPAQ . You wont be disappointed . Any one wants to buy a 505 with all the goodies , cheap .. got one available .. ( .. )  
1	  I bought this lens 5 days ago and fell in love the instant I saw the pictures . Used it all weekend and loving the lens until I set the camera on the tripod ( about a foot high ) and accidentally bumped into the tripod . Next thing you know , camera & lens falls on the carpet floor . Camera was fine but the lens now doesn't want to focus . I hear the motor and the focus ring is slightly moving but feels very tight . Even though I 'm able to turn the focus ring , the distance scale shows that it 's stuck on infinity . I 've read reviews that this is a very sharp lens but the build quality is really bad . I truly believe that now . It will cost me over $ 100 to fix this lens on top of the $ 350 + that I already spent , considering I 've only had this lens for 5 days . Picture is awesome but build quality is really bad .  
1	  I bought this camera because of the 10x optical zoom , which you just don't find on consumer-quality digital cameras . Alas , now I know why . It 's almost impossible to hold the camera still enuf to get a clear picture at maximum zoom unless it 's in bright sunlight ( quick exposure ) or you 're using a tripod-quick 10x zoom shots in less than perfect light are almost always a little blurred . No image stabilization like in the nicer video cameras . If I had it to do over again , I would have bought the highest megapixels I could ( now there are some that are 4 + megapixels ) and a 3x optical zoom . That way , I 'd have the sharpest pix , and a reasonable chance of getting a sharp zoomed in shot , even tho it wouldn't be as close as the 10x .  
2	  This is the first " universal " remote that I have ever tried that actually worksfor all of my equipment . I recently bought a new setup including a LG HD TV , an LGBlueray HD DVD player and a Onkyo AV receiver . It took about 15 minutes to do theititial setup of the Logitec 880 remote primarily because the setup is all doneon my computer which was online with Logitech . The remote worked the very firsttime . With the push of one entre on the video screen , the remote controls all threeunits with ease and from a distance of over 25 ' from the equipment . I received the remote in just two days from ordering on the web and that waswith standard shipping . Needless to say , I am a very happy user and wouldrecmmend the Harmony 880 purchase from Amazon highly .  
2	  Recently i bought a Phillips 32 " lcd and a PS3 becouse i really love videogames and i knew the best way to go is using a HDTV . Now here is were an HDMI cable comes to be really needed . I search amazon for a good hdmi solution and got really impressed for the price on this solution and read the comments , all said this co shipped a great product so i gave it a tryI received it almost a week later and as somebody mentioned before dont expect fancy plastic cases and stuff , the cable came in a plain clear plastic bag , with nothing more than that . Not quite sure about the gold plated connectors .. seems no so yellowish as i tough but im not an expert on this matterInmedatly pluged it to the PS3 back and directly to the tv and voila the PS3 image went cristal clear the menu letter became really defined and color contrast improved a lot . Then i inserted Genji on the PS3 and the image was amazing , vibrant colors , ultrasharp details .. just amazing , its like going from half blind to using eyeglasses .. so i would recommend anyone who needs an HDMI cable to choose thisCant say how it works on any other HD source since in my country theres no such thing as HDTV broadcasting but i will be happy with my blue ray movies and ps3 games . -  
2	  I love these ear buds ! I keep buying the same pair over and over after they start to go bad . I wear them for at least 10 hours every day / night . They fit comfortably in the ear . The wires will eventually start to crack or break if you move them around a ton , but it takes a good 4-5 months for that to happen and alot of wear and tear put on them in that time ! Haven't even thought of replacing them with a different kind !  
2	  I give it 5 stars to counter the idiot first reviewer . It 's obvious to any G series owner that this camera drops the flip screen and RAW format . Get over it . Making up for the loss of the flip screen is a higher resolution , bigger fixed screen . It 's much nicer than the screen on the G6 . I didn't like the loss at first , but i realized i never used it that much except as a means of protecting the screen . It 's actually nice to take the camera out , turn it on , and start shooting without having to flip the LCD back into place . The loss of RAW does not affect me . I 'm someone who takes many photos especially of my newborn but I don't do a lot of post processing . RAW files are huge . The pics generally are good enough and digital has always allowed me to take more than necessary and delete any bad ones . The pics taken with the G7 are great quality . I think this is an issue affecting primarily pros who use this as a second camera , but there is great software out there for jpegs . And most people couldn't tell a jpeg pic from a RAW pic . I think Canon erred on this as i don't think this is the issue that will force people to buy its more profitable dslr cameras . DSLR will always be superior for those action shots or low noise high ISO pics . Maybe it will return in the G8 if the series continues . No matter what , Canon is taking a beating in every review for this . Instead of focusing on what this doesn't have that the G6 had , let 's focus on what this one has instead . IS . Image Stableizer . This is very important . It allows you to take the flash off and take hand held shots in low light . No more blurry pics . Digic II . Allows faster processing and overall performance . Face detection is also new and seems to work nicely . Hotshoe . Very few non dslr cameras have this although i 'm sure the average consumer doesn't care . 6x zoom . Screen . And ability to take wide screen pics . The camera feels very solid and seems smaller than the g6 and of course looks better with the black . The controls and menus are laid out easier IMO . 10 MP isn't that big of a deal to me although i 'm sure it has it 's mass appeal . I think 8 might 've been better , but i 'm not complaining . Macros are much easier to take with this camera vs the G6 . Again , IS helps big time . Lens cap . What lens cap ? This one doesn't need one . Prior G cameras had that loose one that always seemed to pop off . Battery life seems shorter though so you may want that extra battery this time . ( never bought an extra for G6 ) . And it takes SD media which i really don't care for but it is more compatible for me since my laptop has one built in . The movie mode is much improved as well although i have a camcorder for that .. it 's still nice to have . Bottom line , 599 is a lot to pay for a camera these days ( i paid more for the G2 at the time and thought it was pretty cool back then ) . But this is a step short of stepping into the expensive and bulky dslr world . You get a lot of tech in this camera . I 've owned a G2 and a G6 ( that died on me ) and this is quickly becoming my favorite by far . It 's much faster due to the processor . And you get all the manual controls you could want plus the option to add external flash . For point & shoot consumers , just put it on auto which makes my wife happy .  
1	  - Very short battery life ( a few days ) - No key-lock , so the buttons get pressed if in a bag or on belt ( which means you may miss an emergency alert or you may find the batteries dead ) - No memory when you replace the batteries ( have to re-program and set clock ) - Belt clip / holster not strong enough ( keeps falling out ) - Poor reception ( missed alerts ) I would not recomend relying on this radio for backpacking or receiving emergency alerts .  
2	  From the moment you open the box till the final song you hear , the iPod is an experience unlike any other . When I first got thing , I sat down and opened up what was to be the best 250 bucks i 've ever spent . After sliding off the cover and opening the two halves of the cubic box , there is one word on the inside cover , " Enjoy . " And thats what I 've been doing ever since . This thing is an absolute joy to use ! However , many people complain about the 4gb space and how for only $ 50 more you can get more than twice the space . However , all of you should stop and take a look at how much space you really are using . 2gigs ? 4gigs ? 500mb ? Come on , only a small percentage of you actually have more than 5gb of music on your computer . And even if you have 50gb of music , will you actually listen to ALL of it before listening to the same song twice ? I think not . When I bought this , a friend of mine with a 10gb iPod laughed at me and said , " What a waste of money . You could of gotten so much more space for only a little bit more money . " Okay , that is true . But after looking at his iPod , he only had 2GB of music on it ! This example , I belive , is the truth for most ( but not all ) the music lovers out there . We need a reality check everyone .. And here it is : 4gb is about 3 days STRAIGHT listening to music . If you happen to listen to all 4gb of music and get tired , simply hook it back up to your computer and get a fresh set of music . Not too difficult , huh ? You just saved yourself 50 bucks . The truth is , if YOU like the iPod mini , then YOU buy it . Who cares if your friends with the regular iPods make fun of you ? You know that deep down inside , they really envy your mini . Yours is smaller , lighter , more scratch-resistant , easier to use , has a longer battery ( in most cases ) , comes with a USB 2.0 cable , and is cheaper . And lets not forget the coolness factor , which simply dominates all other music players on the market today . But whatever model you choose , you can't go wrong with an iPod .  
1	  I plugged it in the day i recieved it and every time i bumped the cord it caused lines on my monitor . Poor quality just went to bestbuy and picked up there cheapest ( about same price ) no problems now . Chunked this one in the garbage it wasn't even worth the headache of returning it , to me .  
1	  Purchased July 23 , it 's now Aug 5th and the thing is dead . No Power . Dunno what the warranty is , am going to try and contact them , but honestly , that amount of time indicates the thing sucks .  
2	  I am using the DPH-50U to connect my cordless phone to my PC so that I can use Skype-In and Skype-Out as a VOIP service . As long as you follow the instructions with the device ( which are simple and straight forward ) it is a snap to install . An interesting feature of this box is you can also hook up your regular telephone line to it ( I don't have one so I cant comment on this too much ) and then " choose " whether to place your outbound calls over the PC via Skype or on the landline . Of course , you 'd prefer to make traditionally expensive calls over the Skype and maybe local calls , 911 calls , 411 calls , and toll free calls over the landline . Which brings me to my next point . In order to " tell " the box which line to put your outbound call on , you need to do some interesting dialing codes before dialing the number you wish to call .. kind of like dialing " 9 " from your office to get an outside line . To use the skype feature to call 800-555-1212 I 'd have to dial the following :# 001 800 555 1212 * The # tells it you are making a skype call , the 001 is the country code for the United States , then the phone number , and finally * is sort of like the " send " key on your cell phone , to tell the box you are done typing numbers and to initiate the call . This is a little cumbersome to be honest . Since I don't have a regular landline connected I 'm not quite as familiar with the dialing requirements , but I think you just dial out the number and press * ( so you don't have to do the # 00 part as listed above ) When I have an incoming skype call , this device rings my phone and you do not have to do anything unusual to receive the call , just pick up the phone . As a side note , since this isn't a rating on Skype but you should have a little background on the service as well if you are thinking of switching over to Skype for VOIP service , the call quality is quite good . Most of our Skype calls are to South Africa and the quality is the same as any other service I ever used , be it AT & T ; , calling cards , or other VOIP carriers . Another plus is that the US unlimited calling plan with Skype is ( at the time of review ) $ 2.99 a month .. Pretty affordable . But you need to have a PC and keep it on for this box to work , so for those with services like Vonage , they pay more ( $ 25 / mo ) but do not require the PC and if they already have a PC are not required to keep in on 24-7 to receive calls . For me , my PC is on anyway so saving $ 22 a month was a pretty good deal and the hardware cost ( $ 20 ) for this box is a real bargain .  
2	  For an econo box , this little thing can blast out the hits with the power of some of the larger units . I got it just for the CD player , I listen to relaxing music when I sleep so this is just perfect for me  
1	  My House is full of Belkin stuff . You name it , I 've got it ! So when I bought a duplicate HP6045 to use in my media business , I had no hesistation about buying the Belkin Easy Transfer Cable for windows Vista . After reading all the Hype on the package I bought . Unfortunately it is not easy at all . After reading the inadequate instructions , I wasted many valuable hours , and ended up , converting one of my old Hard drives into a USB harddrive , using Acronis 9 , cloned my hard drive , and then cloned it again onto my new 6045 . End of story . When I tried to return the product to Best Buy , they said that I probably used it , and now want my money back , showing mw 4 open box " specials " behind the counter . It never occured to them that the product just plain sucks , unless you are a Computer Whizz , or you have a lot of time on your hands . Over all , I should have used the $ 42.79 to buy some cheap Mexican Weed and mellowed out while transferring the files the old way . ( And not bury the money in the back yard as some other poster suggested )  
2	  I got this case to build a computer for gaming . Right now it is a pretty minimalistic one . The huge 200mm on the top does a great job of expelling the hot air , and the two front 120mm fans are excellent at cooling the hard drive I have in there . I currently have the top fan and the two front fans set to the " medium " speed , and the back fan set to " low " . Each fan has a 3 speed switch , and is set to " low " by the default . There was no 120mm fan that came with the case to put in the side mount , but I doubt I would really need it right now unless I get several more hard drives and a second graphics card . The mount for the power supply is on the bottom of the case , but with all the extra fans it creates no heating problems whatsoever . Installation of the hard drives and motherboard was pretty easy . It comes with two hard drive bays , that hold 3 hard drives each and have a fan attached to them . There are also multiple screw slots to fit many different motherboards . Another nifty thing about this case for me is the tray that is on top , which will fit my gaming controller perfectly . The only downside about this case for me was the size of it , which was rather big . I wasn't able to fit it in my desk where my old tower was , so instead it is sitting on the floor outside . Pros : Fans for the hard drivesHuge top fanVery roomy insideSpace for 6 hard drivesSpace for 3 5.25 inch drivesFan lights act as power lightsPower button and USB / Firewire / Audio jacks on topCons : Larger caseFans can get noisy if set to highFan lights can't be turned offOther notes : Power supply mount is on the bottomHas a tray on the top to hold items ( such as MP3 player or controller )  
2	  Original battery from manufacturer 's product line always comes out the best product there is . It is made in Japan and last longer than comparable replacement batteries . I am very pleased !  
2	  This is the perfect device to purchase to get started with working on Embedded Linux . It is a relatively inexpensive item compared to many reference boards for sale , and it runs uClinux , which has a very active developer community and support site . Actiontec itself is also open to people modifying these devices , and therefore may provide some developer tools some time in the future . A very exciting product !  
1	  la compre junto con mi hard drive external pensando que la sugerencia para el case era la adecuado pero nada que ver me mandaron uno bien chiquito , tener en cuenta esas sugerencias  
1	  I had an HP printer for years , never had a problem . I 've had this C-80 for 6 months now and it is nothing but trouble . Color rarely prints properly , 1-8 sheets of paper feed each time , the printer goes through ink like crazy , but it doesn't seem to end up where it is supposed to be on the paper . Bottom line : a complete piece of junk .  
2	  My previous headphones were the sennheiser hd-280 pro that I bought here on amazon . Somehow or another , the headband snapped on the 280 's after 4-5 years daily office use . I was going to purchase some of the more expensive phones , but decided to give these a try since they are at a great price . Coming from the 280pro 's , these 201 's are extremely lightweight , and have a slightly brighter , but otherwise good sound . The light weight , coupled with a not as tight fit on my head , results in noticeably less sound isolation . I can pretty clearly hear people speaking around me more so than the 280 's . I can mute / lower the music to hear people speak , but with the 280 's I would need to take them off to clearly hear people . With volume more than at a low level , the outside sounds are sufficiently overwhelmed , but I would not recommend these for airplane or other more noisy environments where isolation is more important . Otherwise , these are pretty great over the ear headphones for the price .  
1	  Tomtom wants you to BUY most of the POIs that I expected to be included in the unit , walmart , bestbuy , many diners , resturants are not included in the box or available free from Tomtom  
2	  This unit works well as units close the window and turn them into one-touch system , which also include a tool set the closing force to suit large and small carsNegativesThere is no stop system in case it senses a finger or object in the auto ups path it automatically stops  
2	  Can notice the differance going from Cat 5 to Cat 6 . Plugs in easy , no problems . Even works with wireless routers under them .  
1	  like at least one other reviewer , i have a big issue with the keyboard transposing letters as i type . it is EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING , because i cannot type at my normal speed without continuously backing up to make corrections . in the few minutes or so it has taken me to type this review , i have had to stop and make about 12 corrections . i contacted adesso support , and their response was that " it happens on all keyboards " . it doesn't . between work and home i have about 20 keyboards from a number of manufacturers , and guess what ? none of those keyboards , or any other keyboard i have used since 1980 has had this problem . adesso offered to take it back and send a replacement , but that won't fix the problem . it is a design problem . so i give up . my money is down the drain and i will get another keyboard . it 's too bad , because if it weren't for this problem , it would be a great little keyboard .  
2	  The Product Works Wonderfully , Though I Would Recommend Getting The Software Off Of The Trendnet WebSite Instead Of The CD For VISTA !  
2	  Excellent item to have . I got mine through Amazon . Perfect companion for Canon PowerShot SX150 IS Camera . I love my Canon , but batteries run fast , and I need a lot of power since I take hundreds of close-ups for archaeological work , catalogue and classifying .  
2	  Bought this for my old TV that has problem with the speakers . Virtually all micosystem type stereos have no additional AUX inputs other than this stereo . This is a great way to hook up your Ipod instead of buying some Ipod specific speaker system . The unit itself is nice looking ( ojective ) and the remote control works well and looks nice as well . I did not buy this on Amazon and paid a lot more .  
2	  There is not a lot of turntables available these days . Thank goodness Sony sees the need for one . Good affordable turntable , plays 33 's and 45 's .  
1	  I ordered one roll of poloroid film . IT TOOK FOREVER FOR THEM TO SHIP  
2	  For such a thin and lightweight adapter this stepdown ring is made very well . The threads are precise and the filters screw in easily and the stepdown portion threads onto the lense easily . I looked at some of the cheaper versions and for a few dollars more I think I bought a much better product . I have had a slight problem with my polarizer filter getting stuck . It threads on properly and I only snug the filter but I have had to use my filter wrench a couple of times to get it loose . I wouldn't advise tightening your filters very snug or you may have a difficult time getting them out .  
2	  I make stickers from these sheets . I used to use papillo sheets and they aren't even close to the quality of these sheets . I would never go back to the old sheets !  
2	  I bought this battery for a friend and they love it . I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a new battery for their aiptek digital camcorders .  
2	  Installing on a Gateway box with XP Media Center , I had no problems whatever . We were up and connected within minutes of opening the box . Considering the price , this was a great little unit .  
2	  Both my parents and my grandparents own this dvd player and they love it . My grandparents have had theirs for a year and my parents for 4 months . The great thing that impressed me about the dvd player was the quality of the picture matched with a price you can't beat . It only took about 30 minutes to hook it up and we were off to watching movies with extreme precision in video quality . If you were going to buy a dvd player for home or school , then this is the one .  
1	  It broke the day I got it . The plug got stuck in the wall and nearly ruined the outlet . The worst thing is that I can't get my money back because it would cost more to pay the return shipping than the product cost itself . The cheap price you pay isn't worth it .  
2	  Ok , after reading this you will think that I work for Westone , I don't . I have my own pair of UM1 's and I use a pair of UM2 's when I play at my church . The UM2 's have uncompairable bass quality . I don't know if i can say enough about them . We also have a pair that our bass player uses as his monitor and he said , " These are better than my Bose . " They are truly the best for not only qulaity , but also in cancellation of un-wanted noise . I 've used my UM1 's in a car ride , and operating a CAT , all you hear is the music in the highest quality . Oh this is a little bit of a side note and history of the company , they use to make the shure headpnones , then they broke off and started their own company and they are thriving . And if those ever fragile wires break , just ship it back to Westone for $ 26 and shipping and get new replacement wires installed . Again I don't work for them nor did they pay me , I 'm just another satified musician .  
1	  I have to only give this 2 stars . The product description says that this product is 2x1.2x48 when in fact it is 1x . 5x48 . This is a significant issue . If I didn't need to do this project in 2 days I would probably send it back for the right product . I think I can force the cables I need in here and have it stay shut , if it does workout then I may raise my star rating to 3 but the whole " false advertisement " in the dimensions has really set me back . Outside of that the product itself looks good  
1	  Obviously after paying to have a professional install for a new head unit , 60x4 amp , 4 door speakers and XM .. this unit did not compliment the other items very well at all . It will probably suffice standing alone with factory equipment but with any amount of volume above 50 % levels it distorts and was not worth the money spent for me . I was disappointed and am trying to return it .  
1	  This product comes with no instructions I have yet to find a lense that it accurately fits  
1	  If you arent looking for anything great and you dont wanna spend a lot of money , buy this camera . But if you 're looking for very good picture quality and camera reliability , don't . I got this camera for Christmas and although it wasnt the one I wanted I decided to keep it . First off , the flash is entirely too bright in low light settings and you 're faced with washed out faces and poor color quality , I thought maybe there was a way to change it but I have been trying for over a month now with no luck . Second , the LCD screen is non existant unless you are in a very well lit room . Also , if you have the flash on you very rarely are able to take a picture with one touch of the shutter button , most of the time I 'd have to push it 10 times or more before it would finally take the picture , which is not very fun when you are tryin to be quick about it or your picture subject is moving ( cats , people , etc . ) Overall I would recommend NOT to buy this camera . I 'm not saying its the worst thing out there but you could spend 10 extra dollars and get the Kodax Easy Share . I 'm planning on returning this waste of money and getting one myself because its a much better camera and the picture quality is awesome .  
1	  Pantone huey Pro MEU113On its face , one would believe based on PANTONE being an Industry Standard with regard to accurate color proofing and reproduction , any device they chose to market should be reliable - such is NOT the case with the PANTONE hueyPRO . Ideally this unit would be the perfect solution for most people looking for accurate color calibration on a budget , and still having the illusion of reliability based on the PANTONE reputation , but such was not the case . The device itself is quite simple to setup physically , it has a small footprint on one 's desktop ( which is a plus ) and the software installation and setup is fairly straightforward , so I was able to run that first calibration in just a few minutes after unpacking the device - sadly the first calibration resulted in a very noticeable green cast to my screen . Accepting the possibility of human error on my part , I went over the whole installation process again step by step , attempted a second calibration and again was rewarded with the same green cast . I checked to make sure I had the most recent software version for this model ( which I did ) and also made absolutely sure there were no system software conflicts listed on the PANTONE site ( and there were none ) - given the possibility there was some undocumented procedure , and also the fact the hueyPRO comes with a one-year warranty I contacted their Customer Service / Support Center for assistance , because as it was , the default , generic monitor profile that comes with the computer was more accurate than the hueyPRO , and I could ' eyeball ' a better calibration than that which resulted from using the device enhanced calibration of the hueyPRO . Initially Customer Service answered my query within a timely fashion and offered a replacement unit FREE of charge , which at the time I thought that was quite impressive , but have since come to find is nothing more than a placative measure - although a replacement unit was promised quickly , it took over a week to arrive and after using the provided software that came with the second unit , to remove the installed software of the first unit , restarting the computer and then reinstalling the software yet again from this new disk , I was again rewarded for all my efforts and patience with yet another green cast calibration ! In contacting PANTONE yet again , they were not so quick in their replies this time , and as I waited I did a bit of research on the Internet regarding this " green cast " associated with the " hueyPRO " and found many numerous incidents of this problem and that most of these had no resolution - when finally PANTONE Customer Service did respond , they made a lame conciliatory offer to replace the second flawed unit with a more costly unit ( ColorMunki ) but at a reduced price to make up for my troubles ; the offer looked good at first , but when you factored in the cost of what I was out already for the original first unit , and added the ; " reduced price " to that , I would end up actually spending MORE for the ColorMunki that was offered as opposed to having bought it outright to start with ! Since I originally wanted accurate color calibration for less than $ 100 , being made an offer of something that would end up costing me over $ 200 was NOT a solution , so I politely declined - another ten days pass even though I was promised a timely alternative solution , and when that " solution " was finally forthcoming , it was first prefaced by a very lame , conditional excuse alleging that 2 % of all the hueyPRO units are defective , but I find it rather odd you can buy one from a reseller and have that one be defective and that would just be the simple ' luck of the draw ' - BUT , to get a second unit randomly pulled from PANTONE warehouse stock to also be similarly flawed is much higher than their alleged 2 % odds - I told them that I believed their percentages to be skewed and that we could prove that fact by sending me a third unit and should it also prove to have the same green cast , then we ( PANTONE and myself ) would both know the truth of the matter - no unit was ever forthcoming .. I have since returned the original unit to the reseller for a full refund minus the 15 % it cost me to ship it back to them - they were very nice about taking the unit back and refunding my money in a timely fashion - so kudos to Amazon . com and GizmosForLife and with regard to PANTONE - well all I can say is the one-year warranty isn't worth the paper it is written on , their Customer Service and Support is abysmal and non-responsive and their reputation is now questionable - I should have saved up the extra money and purchased the ColorVision Spyder and I would advise anyone considering buying a hueyPRO to do the same ! So - currently , a month after my original need for accurate color calibration , I have wasted a tremendous amount of time dealing with PANTONE to no resolution , I still don't have a color calibration device , AND I have LESS money towards attaining that device than I started with originally - Thanks PANTONE !  
1	  The first one I bought lasted an astounding 1 day . I sent it back at my cost . 7 weeks later , and calling every day their customer service was opened , I got a replacement . I 've had the replacement for 14 weeks . I know I have black line burned into the right side of the screen . An impossibility I was told on LCD televisions . And , I do . Oh , the TV was 1 week out of warranty when this occurred . Sorry .. Please save yourself the trouble . Save your money for a few more weeks , buy a better , more company-backed , television . DO NOT BUY Westinghouse . Let them whither and die . A bad memory of a company . On second thought , not even a memory , just a rumor that they actually once existed and made bad products . Westinghouse sucks .  
1	  Note : I am fully aware that compact flash cards have a maximum sustained upload speed which caps off the potential speed of the medium it is being transferred on . I purchased this product to use in conjunction with my SanDisk Ultra II compact flash cards . I thought that PC cards would be faster than USB 1.1 and 2.0 , but thats not the truth . Whenever I try to upload files from my CF cards thru the PC card , it slows down the ENTIRE system . I can't do other tasks while the card is uploading files since everything is acting sparatic and slow . I 'll admit , the card is a bit faster in uploading files than USB 1.1 , but I can't do anything else on my computer while the card is working . Honestly , I would rather have a little bit slower performance with my USB 1.1 card reader and be able to work on my computer at the same time instead of having the card slow down my entire system . I believe this card is a 16-bit pcmcia card . I 've heard good praise for Lexar 's 32-bit pcmcia cards , but I have yet to try it out . I 'm sure it costs more money than this PC card or a USB card reader , though .. All in all , I suggest getting a USB 2.0 compact flash reader over this product if you want to work on your computer at the same time as you are uploading files . Otherwise , if your the kinda person who doesnt mind leaving the computer alone while the files are uploaded to your computer , this will work just fine for you .  
1	  I purchased this laptop approximately one year ago thinking that it was a good purchase . I was dead wrong . The machine is incapable of running many games it consistently locks up an issue compaq technical support is incapable of solving . In addition the headphone jack failed on the unit and compaq technical support refused to acknowledge the problem claiming it was a software issue that would be resolved by reimaging the machine ( I subsequently fixed it with a paperclip ) . I am also suffering cracking of the case which apparently is a very common design defect that is present in this series . Although the laptop is quite fast I would not recommend this unit ( or any other compaq ) to anyone due to the poor customer support provided by compaq I have never had to deal with such a poor support staff among all of the other companies I have dealt with in the past .  
1	  We were so disappointed witht the iball . Do not reccomend it . Did not work out of the box .  
2	  It took about a year for my sister-in-law to convince me to spring for my first iPod ( or any other type of portable music machine ) and it took about a day for me to fall in love with it . I can't offer a highly technical evaluation for I have only the one .. nothing to compare it to .. but for the pure joy of hearing my music in such a compact and portable device , I can't imagine much better . I 've now purchased Inport Deluxe and am in the process of converting several hundred cassettes and LP 's into iTunes . I thought they would be lost but am delighted to have them back ! Just received my Bose portable SoundDock and first impressions are that it is an awesome marriage ! And now , instead of fumbling through dozens of CD 's on long road trips , I only need to take my iPod and FM converter and I 'm in music heaven . Thanks Apple .. I love it !  
1	  Drive was horribe destroyed 10 disks software was really bad was on hold for 3 hours for 10 cents a minute on my phone bill .  
2	  I got these in time for a couple of long flights over Christmas and was impressed by how much of the engine noise they cut out and therefore the low volume that I was able to set my iPod to ( between 1/4 and 1/3 volume ) and still be able to hear clearly . The headphones were comfortable though the foam didn't quite cover my ears and so I had to do some slight jiggling to have my ears covered properly . I also tried these on the BART system and found that they didn't really cut out the noise produced by the rails and so they are definitely optimised for aircraft engine noise . Useful that you can use these headphones just to reduce noise with the cord removed .  
1	  The software application that comes with this adapter is very flaky . After I installed it , I started getting a login prompt after boot-up . And upon login , I always got 2 error pop-ups . After installing , the application always allowed me to configure the adapter , but after rebooting , the application no longer even functioned . I tried installing / uninstalling a few times to try different scenarios . One time I got a blue screen during uninstall . I guess I should not have ignored the Windows warning that this software did not pass the Windows logo test . I 'm returning this product .  
2	  This is my first digital camera and I love it . I am a novice . It does everything I had hoped for and more . Dowloading images to my computer is really easy . The battery life is great and recharging is also easy - just plug it in . I am very happy with this camera and know that if I want additional lenses , they are available .  
1	  I purchased this PDA in 2008 .. and again in 2010 because the battery died on the first one . The battery on the second one lasted 1 month and it died . This PDA had so many bugs . It crashed frequently and 150 bucks is way too much money to plunk down on anything as unreliable as this PDA was for me . It 's hard for me to understand why this PDA gets such good reviews . I could understand getting one " lemon " .. but 2 ? .. in 4 years ? Poor resolution and nearly impossible to use in any type of light . Sorry .. but this product is overrated and just plain awful .  
1	  I bought this cable after reading some of the reviews here on Amazon . I had been using the MONSTER hdmi cable on my current Sony HDMI dvd upscaler and the pictures were beautiful . I had purchased recently a PS3 and did not want to spend another $ 70 on a MONSTER hdmi cable so I bought this cable instead . Well , comparing the two dvds of Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge , she is way hotter using the MONSTER cable . If I had never used the MONSTER cable , I would have thought this cable would have been sufficient . But the detail is much sharper using the MONSTER cable . Let it be known , there is a significant difference between the picture quality in the cables . I wish it weren't so because I 'd rather not spend another $ 70 . Actually , I 'm just going to be lazy and just switch the MONSTER cable between my regular SONY player and my PS3 . I don't want to wear out the PS3 playing regular dvds all the time . I know .. I 'm super cheap but at least I 'm trying not to wear the PS3 out , no matter how futile it might be .  
2	  this product just works and that all that matters . My system came with only 1gb of memory but you know manufacturers have a lower grade compared to third parties . So upgrading to this made my day . thanks  
2	  Once upon a time I had two coax cables . I used this . Problem solved !  
1	  Purchased this product despite all the negative reviews . I was arrogant enough to believe my high-tech background could " just make it work " . Man was I wrong about myself ! Setup was easy , pointed the browser to the web interface , entered the same settings ( SSID , channel .. etc ) I had on my WRT54G ( v6 ) , and it connected up like a champ . Two blue lights came on and I received excellent signal everywhere in the house . Unfortunately , that was when the misery started . WRE54g stopped responding whenever one of my wireless clients disconnected . I could not ping it , nor could I access the web interface until I power cycled WRE54g . My network isn't all that complicated - several laptops ( XP and Mac ) , a network printer ( 802.11g ) and two IP cameras riding on 802.11g , and I have minimal interference from neighboring 802.11 devices . I tried fiddling with all sorts of settings , such as locations for the extender , channels , disabled encryption , removed MAC filters , none worked , Whenever someone closed the lid of the laptop , everyone else lost connectivity in a few seconds . No need to take my words for it , Google " wre54g problems " and you will find loads of similar incidents . I wonder if Linksys QA their products anymore .  
2	  This sleeve is a good choice if you 're looking for one for the Dell Inspiron 1420 . I purchased it for under $ 20 meanwhile on Dell 's site they 're selling one for nearly $ 30 . It 's not entirely snug but enough space to slip the laptop in and out of . It 's also thin enough to go into my messenger bag . I think it 's a good fit if you 're putting it into a briefcase or similar bags . The sleeve is a nice addition for stashing away small and thin items . I don't think I trust the strap but it 's not in the way .  
2	  I bought 3 of these cables , even though I only needed two . I figured , at this price , I can buy 3 cables and still not spend as much as my local Radio Shack would want for one cable . All three cables functioned flawlessly on a 42 " Sony Bravia 1080p ( with sound bar / surround sound ) system . These cables work just as well as the ones that cost $ 30 and they 're a LOT easier on your wallet . If you have college kids in dorm rooms - send ' em a few of these in their next care package . They 'll resell them to their buddies and make some beer money for the week !  
1	  The Harmony 550 is an " all right " but not a great universal remote . For the price tag it demands , there are better options . Shortcomings :( 1 ) Ergonomics - the buttons are just plain too small . And if the size of the buttons isn't trouble enough , the non-spatial row of buttons design is a second cause for annoyance . In other words , you never get an intuitive feel for the button layout , and it results in daily occurence of user error .. even after 8 months of ownership . And it 's nearly impossible to navigate with the lights in the room dimmed . ( 2 ) Ease of configuration - you can get up and running in crude fashion in 15 minutes . Getting the remote to really work like the one that came with your TV / DVD player / Receiver takes about 2.5 hours of trial-and-error optimization . It turns the volume up & down in much larger quantums than the OEM remote , and will often change one too many channels when channel surfing . Through loading and reloading and resting the remote , these types of kinks can be reduced after a 1-2 hours of debug . But they can't be eliminated altogether . Logitech took on a big challenge in making the king of universal remotes . This one has software optimization and ergonomic problems that other Logitech remotes don't have .  
1	  Had the product only 1 month . Worked great until started getting " Wrong Disc " error . Now the thing won't play any DVD 's . Never dropped or exposed to extremes . Stopped working for apparently no reason . This seems like too common a problem based on my quick scan of other reviews on Amazon . Now I 've got to try to get some service from Coby .. doesn't look like others have had good results with their customer service . Be Warned .  
2	  FANTASTIC camcorder ! Awesome stills and vids . Highly recommended for beginning user based on low price and ease of use ! Only tough part is converting video 's . Still recommend to any user looking for HD quality !  
1	  To those of you who have lost your manual ( myself included ) you can find basic operating functions on the Koss-AV . com web site under FAQ's-Answers / CDR Recorders . ( Note : This is not the Koss headphone website . ) They have not yet posted the full manual on the website , however the info posted should help . My unit it worked quite well for a while and I was smiling like a number of the other happy reviewers who made their first recordings , until recently ( of course the 90 day warranty has expired ) when all seems to be failing . I , like an earlier reviewer had a disc in the unit when it was turned off and upon turning it back on it endlessly searched for the CD prohibiting opening the CD drawer ( funny I didn't read this in the now lost manual , which by the way appears to have been written by someone whose first language is not English ) . I returned the unit to Best Buy where I purchased it ( that was the second day after I bought it ) and they got the CD out and gave me a new recorder ( gut feeling at the time was to get my money back - funny about those gut feelings ) . Later this happened again with the replacement when the unit failed to read a disc . Frustrated , I got out my screwdriver out and got the CDs out myself . Not easy but can be done . Not a good design ( note : before going for your tool box , try turning the recorder off and on completely-unplug it . This " might " reset the computer and then it " might " then read the discs . If this doesn't work then you have to go in with surgery or just toss the thing out ) . For some reason my recorder has over time become more and more unreliable in recording . It has recently failed almost every CD recording either rejecting the CD one time and then recording it the next after numerous attempts or recording and then failing to finalize the disc resulting in an unusable recording unless you want to listen to all your copies off the recorder . All electronics are subject to failure but this one seems to fail on its own accord when ever it pleases . I have not used other CD recorders but this one won't be my choice when I replace it which looks like it may be very soon .  
1	  I bought this charger a few months ago . The charger is nice , but the batteries cannot hold the charges . They keep loosing charges within a few days . I would not recommend this charger to anyone . Total waste of money !  
1	  This is the second remote I have purchased made by " Universal " . The first one ( MX500 ) I was very happy with until my son dropped it for the 30'th time and it finally died . I purchased this one because I liked the look of it better , and the price was about the same . I wish I would have ordered another MX500 . The buttons on this one feel cheap when depressing . There is a little resistance , then it clicks down . Not smooth operation like the other . The down button doesn't work every click either . I had to program a different button so it would work consistantly .  
1	  The leather case that comes with the Palm V allows you to put the case on either side . This makes use of the Palm V a lot easier for us left-handers . This hard case looks great and I was really excited to get it , but it only opens to the left like a book . This makes it difficult to juggle hands with the stylus in order to get into a position to use it . I wish that Palm made a left-handed version ! Oh well .. I 'm sending this one back ..  
2	  I just bought this today , scanning is very easy , it prints fast . I rated it 4/5 because of the paper tray , it has an input tray , but the out tray is the same input tray separated only a little , unlike my older mode Hp 845C that had two well defined trays . The other thing is the compatible cartridges , Hp 21 and 22 both are 5ml ink cartridges , compared with my older Hp 845C that uses Hp 15 and 17 25ml . We all know that they sell you cheap printers to sac you out buying their ink , but I suggest you to forget about it , don't waste ink , set it on draft by default so that way you don't have to set it to print in draft each time you want to print and keep some cartridges in case you are close to run out of ink , though it tells you when they are running low .  
2	  When trying to tape a hour documtary it is great to have a blank 60 minute on one side cassette to record on .  
2	  I 've had my shuffle for a month now and i don't think i can live without it . I use it on my commute to work , at the gym , at the grocery store , when I take out the garbage . It 's like having your own soundtrack . I have 3 other regular ipods but they were a little too bulky and fragile to bring everywhere . I like listening to my 6,000 songs randomly which the shuffle does a perfect job of , itunes is so easy to use compared to music match and all the other stuff out there . the battery life is amazing . Get the white sony fontopia earbuds , they go awesome with the shuffle . At this point , I think I would rather give up my TV and laptop before the shuffle , never thought I would say that . I listen to Bright Eyes , Mozart , Joni Mitchell , Billie Holiday , Supertramp , etc randomly , I know it sounds weird but I really enjoy the mix . I don ; t know why people complain about the lack of a screen , after all you are putting in your own music , if you don't like it dont put it in ! Hate to gush about any product like this , but it has really made my life that much more pleasurable , so I am hoping that you will give it a chance .  
1	  However I 'm using Vista Ultimate 64bit . I know I know but I 'm testing the OS . It says it 's compatible but it runs extremely slow if not at all . Just a note the autorun on the CD provided installs the 32bit version . you have to explore the CD to find the 64bit software . The website only has the drivers and not the software . i reinstalled the software twice but same results . this is on a clean OS install .  
1	  The sound quality on these ' phones is maybe just barely acceptable for the price , but the extremely flimsy construction is just pathetic . The plastic material on the bands near the cups is really weak and will break eventually , probably sooner then later . I 've had to preform surgery with tape a number of times and they 're still falling apart and I know other people who bought them and ended up in the same position . It seems like you 're paying for the cost of the name Bose . But if you want something that 's not going to fall apart in 6-8 months , look elsewhere .  
1	  I 'm not really sure how this thing works . I 'm not literate when it comes to equipment like this , but I couldn't get anything to record on this card right out of the box . Am I supposed to do something with it first , before I can record anything ? The directions are horrible and don't make any sense . As I admitted , I am not literate , but I think I can pretty much figure things out . This issue , I can not . Does anybody have any suggestions so I can change my rating on this ? I put the card right into my camera , as well as my computer and it doesn't read anything and doesn't even acknowledge that it is there . I feel like I wasted my money up to this point .  
1	  I had to return 2 receivers to Best Buy . The first unit I bought had a short somewhere inside , and wouldn't stay on for more than 10 seconds . The replacement unit wouldn't give me any sound from the left side .. and I tried both " A " and " B " left speaker positions . I usually trust Yamaha .. but this one is apparently their low end model so if you decide to buy it , make sure you know the store 's return policy !  
2	  I have had my frame under constant use on my office desk for nearly six months without problems . Clear display . My only complaint is with the included software which is not as user friendly as could be and quite slow to up load pictures .  
2	  Literally , I 've had this same model since 2007 and it is still going strong . I have never had one ounce of trouble out of it , no dropped signals , no security issues , no slowing down of service-no trouble at all . One awesome thing is that I have multiple devices linked to it with no issues . Almost daily , there are 2 laptops , 1 Kindle Keyboard WiFi , 1 Kindle Fire , various cellphones , and a Roku box linked to it wirelessly . I switch between these devices effortlessly . I use multiple devices at the same time , even , like my laptop and cellphone , laptop and kindle , laptop and Kindle and cellphone , etc . In no way have I had ANY trouble with this router supporting multiple devices at the same time . For those with Roku or other streaming boxes , it plays my videos flawlessly even while using other devices . Rarely , very , very , rarely , it might show that it 's buffering but maybe 6 times that has happened since last fall and it always corrects itself soon after . In 2007 , I remember that it took me HOURS to get the security and password setup . Maybe now I wouldn't have so much trouble with it because I 'm more experienced with computers but even at that time , I was very good with computers and still had trouble getting it set up . However , even if you don't know much about computers , this is still worth buying even if getting it set up is a hassle . Ask around your friends or relatives to help you set it up . After it 's set up , be sure to save the network password somewhere safe like on a jump drive . I had a 32 digit security password so there 's no way I could remember that . Every time I bought a new device , I just stuck in the jump drive , pulled out the password , and copy and pasted it . After you store it in your computer or device , it is saved on the device so that you never have to see it again unless your computer crashes or something like that . Even if you have to pay a professional to install this in your household , it is worth the money . Sit and think how reliable and well made this device is to last SEVEN years of heavy , heavy use . I work from home and am a writer so literally every waking hour I spend online . Sit and think what electronic devices last that long in this day and age . There are a few things you need to know . Once the item is out of warranty , Linksys no longer helps with problems at all . I chatted with their customer service today and they said that since it 's so old , they no longer give chat or other support when issues arise . Consider that if you 're buying a used one especially if you aren't computer savvy . Even in 2007 the customer service rep was very rude and short with me during phone support . She ended up cutting me short before the problem was solved , said she 'd call me back but never did . A couple hours later I was able to get the router set up myself . Also , this product is no longer getting upgrades to the firmware . The last update was in 2010 so it is a bit dated yet still it works excellently with me . I had 7.0 in 2007 and the last upgrade made was 7.2.08 . So the the 5 years I 've had it there have only been a couple updates and that will be it . Tonight I needed to reset the password because I shared my internet with some neighbors who are having hard times but they slowed my computer down so much that I had to put a stop to it . I spent a couple hours online and was able to update the password . Like everyone else has said , this is not for beginners if you are doing it yourself . If you just do basic browsing and email , you could buy a $ 20 one . However , if you need a powerhouse this is what you should buy , in my opinion , or at least a Linksys router if not this same one . Like I said before , it 's a bit dated and no longer being supported . Security is top notch , very well made , handles multiple devices , great wireless range even if I go outside under the carport to write and web browse . It 's all good . Don't buy this if you aren't well trained in computers or if you are expecting to do it yourself . I was at my wits end tonight and was about to call my cousin who is a computer engineer to help me . I didn't want to bother him so I just kept researching until I figured it out myself . I am the one my friends and family come to for computer help and it 's been that way for 10 years and I still had trouble . Customer support is terrible . But as for the product itself w / o considering difficult setup or terrible customer service , this Linksys product is outstanding . Buy it if you 're looking for a router . Just be sure to hire a pro to set it up which would maybe take an hour so $ 100 or so , I 'm guessing , but it is worth it . SEVEN years . It blows my mind . If you don't buy this outdated router , I would recommend a Linksys router even if you don't buy this particular one . I 'm getting ready to upgrade to a newer model but I was so impressed by this one 's longevity that I wanted to write a glowing review to give it a well deserved farewell .  
1	  I brought this HDMI cable wire to connect my Roku player to my HD TV . The first problem was that it arrived a week after the Roku player , but not the biggest deal . In the interim I used my HDMI wire from my upconverting DVD player since I would be streaming much of what I watched now . When I finally connected the newly arrived HDMI wire , the picture showed static . Though it played , the screen itself showed static ( black and white or green dots ) all over the picture . Knowing a little bit about TV 's and connections it was easy to deduce something was wrong with the connection . I flipped the wires , changed the ports , disconnected everything to reconnect , reconnected only the Roku with that HDMI wire and even swapped the wire in different devices . Same problem . Good price , didn't work for me . At a $ 1.69 its not worth the hassle to return , but I probably won't buy from this supplier again .  
2	  I have the D-Link 120 wireless adapter and I have absolutely no problems with it . I love it ! I have a dell pc , I am two floors away from the router , and I get 100 % strength . This is a must buy ! For all those who are not getting perfect strength try going into your Wireless network settings-right click on your connection and hit properties . Go to your wireless network tab and UNCHECK " use windows to configure my wireless network settings " This will keep you online at all times .  
1	  I dont ' think its the best camera . Sctatchy noise has to be plugged in to extension cord because batteries are rechargeable and last only 4 hrs . Good for the price to be able to watch things and the audio is good .  
1	  HI MA NAME IS TOM , AI CAME TO YOUR SITE MY FREINDS HAVE RECOMDED IT , THE GARMAN NAVAGITATION IS WELL NO GOOD IT SENDS YOU IN THE WRONG WAY , AFTER SPEEKING WITH THE GARMAN SERVICE REP , REPROGRAMING THE UNIT , IT IS VERY SAD TO SEE CONPANY 'S SUCH AS ELECTRONICA DIRECT AND AMAZON NOT WILLING FOR ME TO RETURN THIS PRODUCT , NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY FROM THIS SITE OF ANY COMPANY , S YOU WORK WITHTOM NARDONE  
1	  I bought the headphones with lanyard for light use at work . I did not hang my ipod from the lanyard ( so no extra weight pulling on the cords ) . It worked pretty well , although the movement of the wires against my clothing was fairly loud . Still worth the trade off , except the sound completely died in one of the earbuds after less than 2 months of use . Very disappointing .  
1	  I bought three of these cameras and the audio stopped working a week , the other two shortly . All of them stopped working the microphone . I do not recommend . Do not buy this camera !  
2	  Nikon has about the best reputation in photography and if they put their name on it , it 's good enough for me . It has proven to be a good product for me and I 'd recommend it .  
2	  Purchased this with the Elura 100 . It is incredible how much you can fit into this small case . The camera , charger , cables , manual and a 5 pack of tapes all fite nicely into the case . It 's made of high quality materials and is well worth the $ .  
2	  The receiver works just as described . It receives HD signals over the air and allows the user to use his HD ready T.V. as it was supposed to be used . Many HD T.V. 's do not have a built in HD tuner , this solves the problem .  
2	  Track Listing : 1 . Safe In The Arms Of Love2 . Body Rockin ' Time3 . Aiming For The Heart  
2	  I must admit , I had my doubt about a radio that works with batteries or power , but sure enough , I just cranked it a few times , and it started right up . The reception on this radio is better that my electric powered stereo system . I love the peace of mind that it WILL work in case of an emergency .  
2	  This is a great product . Ink & paper in one . No more buying 6 different colors of ink . However , the ink always seems to get used up before all the paper does . As a consequence , a lot of paper gets left over .  
2	  This little machine is a beast ! You can feel the air being pulled out but the best part is you can't hear it at all ! Wonderful for gaming since you don't want any distracting background noise when you are deep in it .  
2	  I recently purchased a Macbook Pro 17 for my business and needed a new travel bag to fit the laptop in . After deliberation , I realized I did not need anymore worries about how to protect my investment on the road ( I already had plenty transitioning from lifelong PC usage to a Mac ) . Because I am an amazon prime member , I went ahead and got this bag knowing that if it isn't right , the folks at Customer Service will help me get it right . I received the bag a day before my long business trip and it performed excellent . Fit below the coach seat I paid for .. fit easily in the overhead bin .. and it held everything I needed to do work anywhere . It is organized nicely and the laptop stays very snug in the soft lined partition . I will probably look to purchase other Targus products from Amazon . I am very happy with this bag . Great for all you power travelers out there .  
2	  Really happy with the case . It is lightweight and side pocket is perfect for extra batteries .  
1	  We never received this item . I e-mailed the Rainbor group but never received a reply . I will never order anything through them again .  
2	  I bought these batteris for my Olympus camera . They work awesome as does the charger .  
1	  The product appears to be everything one would want in a printer - the problem is the drivers . Not only do the drivers take 700 + MB of disk space which is outrageous , but they crash often . In addition , the programs that come with the printer are unstable . Good hardware , poor drivers make this a pass .  
1	  .. which ended up being about 6 months . After that the dvd laser only worked when it felt like it , which wasn't very often . Now it will only play cd 's since they use a seperate laser . I 'd suggest getting something else , unless you 're just wanting one to hold you over .  
2	  The item performs like any other USB 2.0 , but I wished I had realized it was 10 long . Bulky , but works great otherwise .  
1	  Like many of the reviewers , iFind this product to be iNother piece of Steve Jobs ' garbage . Apple sucks when it comes to making hardware ( and software for that matter ) . This particular , silver / white piece of iGarbage iFroze after iFew months and could not be restored . It is the second iPod ( over 80 gigs ) that has done that to me . iHave now learned my lesson to NOT buy Apple hardware garbage anymore . iTunes is decent enough , iSuppose - but iRecommend downloading music from [ .. ] ( 88 cents per download ) or Amazon . com and getting iBetter piece of hardware ( not Apple ) . Remember : don't believe the iPe . Apple sucks .  
2	  I 'm no expert on sound quality I think this one is good . I like how it folds up to smaller size . I feel comfortable with the cushion shape and quality .  
1	  Quality is poor . Audio is very substandard . Quality starts OK , but after a few minutes degrades . This is the first time I have used o a cassette in my car . I will try another brand . If same thing happens , it may be my cassette player .  
1	  I am actually glad I didn't recieve the item I ordered , because I ended up buying one that is much nicer and has much better sound quality . I was very angry when I recieved an email from the seller saying the product had been damaged in shipping and they didn't have any more to send and that was it . No other suggestions , nothing . This item was for a specific event and I had to wait two more weeks until I was able to purchase another product and get it to my husband .  
2	  In late 2002 , the potential of the PCTV Deluxe was great , but it was just too buggy so I waited before I bought it . As of February 2003 , version 1.5 is out and nearly all the bugs are gone . I bought it to use on my XP computer , plugged it up & installed according to the directions that came with it , and everything worked great without needing any tweaking . The picture quality is good . Easy to install . It 's been fun so far . I 've recorded shows that I wanted to watch , then delete them when finished without having to worry about video tapes or recording over another show I wanted to keep . I have also recorded shows via PCTV Deluxe that I want to save to a VCD and the quality has been pretty good . I have also converted a vcr tape to a DVD and the quality was great . It looks like the new version 1.5 software has really cleared up a lot of problems other users have reported . Check the date of their review if their comments cause you concerns . At one point their comments were valid and relevant , but most of those problems are now corrected that were mentioned in reviews posted before the Jan / Feb 2003 timeframe . I just hope I can easily get future versions of the software if Pinnacle continues on to version 2 or higher . The Titan TV website lists PCTV Deluxe as one of the recorders it is working with for its automatic recording function . I have not tried it yet , but if automatic recording is not yet functional , it should be available soon . PCTV Deluxe is turning out to be a really good product .  
1	  I bought a Nomad jukebox Zen , and in about 4 months it jammed up completely , I 've tried everything . Best buy covers only 90 days on the warranty , so I 'm stuck . I 've had a terrible experience with Nomad , then got a 15gB Ipod and that works fine . Pay the premium for quality , Nomad quality is poor .  
1	  This salad shooter thing was terrible ! I tried it and it took me longer to make the salad with that then it would have without it . You can only cut certain types of vegetables and fruit and 1/2 of what you cut gets stuck inside the machine . When I went to clean it , 1/2 my salad was in the machine and was wasted . It also made a funny burning smell when I put something in to cut . I would not suggest this to anyone . If you didn't return it you would put it in the back of a closet and throw out in a few years .  
2	  This is the second one of these that I 've bought . I looked at about a dozen other types , but keep coming back to this one . It 's functional without being overburdened with features .  
1	  I did purchase this item for my point-and-shoot camera ( 2.5 " LCD ) and it works very well in blocking the sun / glare from the screen . My only problem , and it 's a big one , is that in removing the shade itself , when you don't need it is a nice little TAB arrangement ( 4 TABS , 2 / top and 2 / bottom ) made of plastic . These little tabs actually broke off within 2 weeks of purchase . Not very reliable . These should be made of a stronger material so they don't break with normal use .  
2	  My carbine optics uses these obscure batteries . So do otoscopes , sometimes you can get a replacement battery from medical . A note to civilians , batteries along with sun screen is considered hazardous material and must be stored and procured accordingly . To purchase hazardous material is a lengthy process , in this case it is not worth it , so we buy these out of pocket .  
2	  Great deal . Had one before before and my brother broke it , but bought another one because its the best product out there for the value and quality !  
1	  We got this printer for our office . This printer has a problem printing envelopes . When you print an envelope the envelope comes out wrinkled and sealed . I called HP customer service and they told me they had many complaints about this issue from other customers and that unfortunately there is no solution for it . They suggested to upgrade the printer for some other model . The price of the model they suggested was $ 1,200 . We had to return the printer and get another brand . Don't recommend .  
2	  Despite its cumbersome appearance , this converter works very well and is a great deal in comparison to other options on the market !  
1	  I bought this player for my wife and I 'm sorry I did . Basically , it 's just an average media player with synchronization issues . In a nutshell , this is what you get for your buck : Sound Quality : Pretty good for most people . If you 're an audiophile , you may want to spend a few extra bucks in getting better earphones but the same can be said about most other players . Video and Picture Quality : Pretty good too . Kind of a small screen for video but who will sit through " Citizen Kane " in front of this thing anyway ? Portability : Really light and it slips nicely into pockets . No complaint . Battery life : I listen to it at work ( sometimes during 11 hour shifts ) but it still never falls bellow half its battery 's capacity . I 'm happy with that . Storage : 2GB is enough if you listen to the same few albums all the time but that gets old for everybody sooner or later . You 'll spend long nights synchronizing new music into it ; which takes me to the next point .. User friendliness : NOT friendly . When you 're trying to synchronize , after the first 1 to 10 songs , the synchronizing process freezes without any warning and you 'll have to stop the process and restart it ( if you 're using Windows Media Player 10 ) ; if you 're using Windows Media Player 11 , you 'll have to unplug the device and plug it back in altogether . This can easily make you spend a whole hour synchronizing just 4 albums , no joke . Allegedly , you can eliminate this problem by rolling back to WMP10 and updating your firmware ; I tried that and spending 2 weeks reading forums on how to get over this nuisance in vain . I consider myself really computer literate and I still can't find a way to fix the little thing . Compatibility : Linux users , nothing to see here ! As of late December , I tried this fellow with 10 different Linux distros ( Ubuntu , SimplyMEPIS and Freespire among them ) and it didn't work with any of them ! I didn't try with mac at all . In general , this player could be it for people who don't own a large music library if the folks at Philips sat down and wrote the sync drivers properly . Until that day , save yourself the trouble : there 's other MUCH better players out there for this same price .  
2	  This unit is a snap to install and begin using immediately . The RT314 combines a personal firewall , dhcp server and four-port switch ( 10/100 autosensing , full-duplex ) to make sharing a DSL / Cable connection for a small / home office a painless process . First of all , it 's got a slick " how to set it up from scratch " poster which shows you enough graphics to make the physical setup easy . Once it 's cabled and powered on there 's a decent web interface ( .. ) for administering its settings . Just enter the administrator password and a first-time-use wizard that will walk you through configuring all the stuff that lets your PC ( s ) talk to your Cable or DSL provider ( DNS settings , default gateway , etc ) . There are more advanced features available through a telnet session and ROM upgrades can be made through a routine FTP connection . Best of all , its got a basic , port-filter / firewall that stops almost all unnecessary activity between your computers and the internet , allowing only the most common by default . Online gaming and chat enthusiasts may have to tweak the default settings to let their favorite software programs do their thing , but for regular users the defaults should be fine . For the neat freaks among us the cable ports are located on the back of the unit , so they 're easy to tuck out of site . At the same time all of the status and activity lights are on the front for easy viewing . One other note : I almost went with a similar unit from Linksys ( it was a little cheaper ) but many customer reviews indicated Linksys provided horrible technical support . I went with Netgear instead and haven't regretted it once .  
1	  I ordered two of these . One was fine , but the other has a problem : one of the four pins in the Molex end isn't fastened to the connector . When plugged in , it didn't connect . I didn't notice the problem when I installed the connector , but after I confirmed the RAID drive it was supposed to power wasn't bad , the only other possibility was that the power connector was bad . Fortunately I ordered two , so I removed the defective one and installed the good one . I 'm returning the defective one . In the process , I learned that when you buy a defective item through Amazon Prime that 's fulfilled but not sold by Amazon , you can't return it for a refund even though it 's defective ; you can only exchange it . Not a big deal in this case , but worth knowing for the future . It 's my first experience with an OKGear product and doesn't leave me with a favorable impression of their quality control . I hope it 's not representative , but I have no way of knowing . UPDATE : I wanted a refund , but Amazon didn't offer the option ( because Amazon wasn't the seller ) , so I requested a replacement . To my surprise , I received a refund instead . I guess someone realized that the cost of shipping such a cheap item didn't warrant it , which was fine with me . I 've never before had a cable like this fail , so I wasn't in a hurry to try another from the same manufacturer .  
1	  The wireless router keeps getting knocked off . I have to power down and power up every time . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT .  
1	  Hi everyone .. I got this one for my new blackjack . I was not interested in it because of the price but because I wanted something conventional wired handsfree for my phone without a bluetooth ( I think bluetooth is not yet accepted culturally and makes you look like a clown in meetings .. Anyway ! ) As soon as I got it .. I tried to plug it in my phone .. it wont plug in .. I was afraid I might damage my phone port connector .. Also even after connecting it makes a thundering sound whenever I change my ringtone or music or click website links .. I would say if you dont want to buy a bluetooth .. dont go for this one at least .. use handsfree speakers .. thats what I am gonna do !  
1	  When I tried to remove the eyecups cover , one of eyecups came off with it . The way of this Turn-Slide feature works is by using a ball press fit on the main body . Once the cup comes off , the little tiny sliver ball will immedetaly fall off , and there 's no way you can find it . I would 've expected Nikon does a better job than this . Be very very careful when you remove the conver .  
1	  This hub is an expensive hub that fits well and looks good , but because it has no power , it isn't very useful . You need power for USB devices , in particular , or many of them won't work . It 's OK for a printer or Flash memory stick , but not so good for a keyboard , mouse , iPod , camera , or many of the other devices that power up via USB ports , when plugged in . Worse , the one I bought only lasted 2 years before it failed or burned out ! ? There are better products and a POWERED USB HUB is worth the extra money . This is my 3rd Belkin USB hub and I have not had much better luck with the other two . They make nice cables , but got cheap on the USB hub design .  
1	  I have been the owner of this MP3 player for over a year . I must say that compared to other flash MP3 players , this one is quite antiquated in storage capacity , technology , and sound quality . 128 MB is barely enough for 2 CDs ; lacking for today 's music collections , especially when compared to similar products with 1 GB and 2 GB storage capacities . Also , this player does not support USB 2.0 , which means waiting a relatively long time for file transfer . Luckily , iRiver made a smart move by allowing savvy users to reflash the firmware with experimental UMD support . Sound quality is decent , but don't expect it to match a certain shuffling competitor 's near-perfect square wave reproduction . Frequency response is not flat , and extraneous harmonics are introduced into the output signal . A third thing I would like to mention is the use of AA batteries . This thing goes through them like nothing , with minimal listening time ( 2 to 3 hours ) . If batteries are as hard to come by for you as they are here , you 're going to find yourself being without music often . The durability is sorely lacking . A month after purchase , the buttons and the joystick had lost their responsitivity . You would have to press the same button repeatedly 3-4 times for it to register . The battery case no longer wants to stay shut without tape . The last straw is when the joystick broke off and stopped functioning completely , causing me to write this review . This is an on-the-go music player . It should be able to hold up to the stresses of being in a backpack . If you are looking for an up-to-date , functional MP3 player , " shuffle " to another brand .  
2	  Unfortunately , the compant initially sent me the wrong product . I had to get ahold of them via email to let them know this . In respect to the company though , I must say that they took immediate action to send me the one that I really ordered , and they paid the shipping for it . I would have rather done business over the phone , but the company does not provide you with a customer service number nor a mailing address . This makes me wonder about the company itself . What are they hiding comes to mind immediately . No website either . Now , is it truly a universal mount ? No . If your Flat Panel TV does not have the VESA mounting patterns this mount will not work on it . Such is the case with my Toshiba Flat Panel . So this mount in its original form would not work either . But since I can weld , I made a mounting bracket ( Aluminium ) with a VESA pattern drilled into it that would fit the back of my TV . Then I mounted the universal moiunt to that . Added about an inch to the distance from the wall by doing this . But since I bought it to articulate the tv into a corner of the room , no big deal . The mount itself is well made and easy to install .  
1	  I have have already exchanged these speakers once , and i am going to return them again . They sound good when you first turn them on , but as time goes on , they start to crackle , pop , and make windy sounds . This continued even when they were disconnected from the computer . I do not reccomend these .  
2	  Works like a charm . Easy to program . It 's inexpensive but does what it 's supposed to do . Recommended .  
1	  I never received product and was talked to very rudely buy the seller when I told them that I had a problem ..  
2	  Its a great tool , makes the paper map just about obsolete , but you still need to use a little conmen sense , nothing 's perfect  
1	  This is a horrible product . Pieces began breaking on it before I even finished putting it together . Poorly made !  
1	  I Was very dissaponited with this product ! The first thing is the range . I can barley get 5ft . away . The Next thing is I have to put a radio next to my computer instead of computer speakers . Also it does not come with updated software I searched the internet with little luck .  
1	  My internet connection flickers between on and off . I 'm connected to the internet for about 3 seconds then the wireless adapter drops it . Very frustrating .  
1	  The following is a recount of my personal experience with this Netgear product as well as my own opinions about the products usefulness . My background : I am a computer programmer with about 10 years of work experience and a 4.0 grade point average from an Ivy League school . I was not able to get this product to work with an IBM ThinkPad T22 running Windows XP . I got the infamous " Code 10 " problem that many others are seeing with this product . ( .. ) a google search for ' netgear wg511 " code 10 " ' to see more . Besides the problems that users are having , the technical support requires that you traverse " Bangalore Hell " , from which you will probably not receive the information necessary to fix the problem ( which , from the above posts , seems to be a driver software problem ) . I tried various versions of the drive software downloaded from Netgear , including the latest 2.7.0.0 driver . This was the latest software available as of July 17 , 2004 . I was never able to get my laptop to properly recognize the card . No combination of removing and reinstalling drivers , removing and reinserting the wireless card , or clearing out Windows registry keys helped . There is a reference to this problem on the Netgear website . However , it is terse and does not seem to offer a solution - none of the approaches listed helped solve my problem ( .. ) personal " solution " to the " Code 10 " issue was to pack up the Netgear router and card and return it to Amazon . I have since replaced it with a Linksys combination which worked right out of the box . I didn't even need to install software - Windows XP 's built in Wi-Fi support was all that was needed . Please note that this is only my personal experience and the experiences of various other anonymous posters on the Internet . It may not reflect every user 's experience ( or even the most common experience ) , and must be taken with a grain of salt . Thanks for reading all the way through ! :-) - ( .. )  
1	  If your looking for a great , long lasting , non - skiping , battery efficient , durrable , light , slim , good looking , great sounding , feature loaded , CD player , this is not the one ,  
2	  MY Ipod Mini is really cool . I got the green one . Its really easy to use and great for car rides , exersising and just for enjoyment . A couple of warnings : If you buy the dock DONT use it all the time because the paint will chip off . Also dont use the Belt clip a lot becuase the paint will chip off too . I would reccomend getting a car charger , apple care , dock , and an armband . Same with armband dont use it a lot because the paint will chip off .  
1	  Price : This pack weight only 1 pound 10oz shipped to me by USPS . I have been keeping track of the price of this item . The product itself should cost around $ 20 and shipping should be less than $ 4 . 3rd party retailer from Amazon take turns picking up the sale of this item so the price goes up and down . I have seen AdoramaCamera selling it for $ 22.95 + $ 8.23 shipping and that 's a big rip off . What they are doing is trying to raise the shipping so they pay less sales commission to Amazon , on the other hand if you decide to return / change , you will get less credit back . Tips & Quality : One thing I 'd like to warn everyone , make sure your film is a 5-frame cut or less . In my case , I have 6-frame cut so I have to cut out 1 frame if I want to fit-all . I ended up keeping it coz I already have it opened and they charge 20 % restocking and I have to ship it back . My fault tho . As far as quality , I wish I could pay a little more to get better quality one - these sleeves are very clear but it 's the thinnest I ever seen , I have seen better one at pro-shop but of course they cost more . It 's  
1	  I am not a Christian , but the premise of this book was so fascinating that I checked it out from my local library . I am SO GLAD I did not buy it ! The first few chapters are rather interesting ; I very much liked the idea of shaking up the Vatican , and initially I liked Bill Kelly . But his kids were of the saccharine overly precocious sitcom type that I abhor to listen to . His daughter 's conversion seemed completely unrealistic and tacked on . All conversations in the book are stilted , and too many opportunities for real theological and philosophical considerations fall by the wayside , presumably to make room for silly and clunky subplots involving the pope 's children . There is always room , however , for the clumsy , turgid presentation of the authors ' agenda , including a painful speech about AIDS being a punishment for homosexuality , right before an exended trip to Africa where AIDS is , even in the novel , clearly a heterosexual issue . Also , there is the odd statement that the majority of Americans are pro-life , which is simply not true , according to any poll I 've ever seen . I also disliked the characterization that OF COURSE the gay couple was exceptionally attractive , as if gay people must be exceptional in every way to straight people . Equally annoying were their thinly veiled references to Clinton , unfailingly referred to as " the American president . " His identity was obvious , so why be coy with the name ? I would have given this novel only one star for the writing which only very occasionally achieved mediocrity , but they did have an interesting idea , so I gave them the second star for that .  
2	  It can be used in both travel and car attachment . It is very useful . It has more compartment for storage .  
2	  Works as advertized . I generally use it in my GPS unit , and sometimes in a digi-cam ( 6mp and it shows like 1500 pics at highest resolution / dpi available ) it would also work fine in my Wii , although I haven't needed it yet . I also have a 4gb and a 2gb MicroSD + adapter .  
1	  Bought this for my husband for Christmas . It 's May , and we still haven't figured out how to use it .  
2	  I like the quality , easy to attach , nice feel when it is on the camera . I like having the option of using 2 types of batteries . Glad I read the reviews before I ordered the Canon product .  
2	  Do not hesitate to buy this LCD Monitor . Screen is so bright , sharp and colorful it 's amazing . Upgraded from a Viewsonic E90fb and it 's a night vs . day difference . Glossy screen makes everything so clear & crisp . Zero dead pixels and arrived in two days !  
1	  I had decided to try switching from PCs to macs recently , and thought the mac mini would make a good first mac computer . I ordered my first mini with all the extras and when i got it , i tried importing all my cds to itunes . The optical drive was malfunctioning whenever i put in a cd with the slightest scratch on it . It would freeze up , making an awful skipping sound , and i would have to force quit itunes and sometimes shut down the computer and turn it back on just to get the sound to stop and get my cd out . I called tech support , and the first man said there was nothing wrong with the drive , it was my cds that were at fault . Their solution was to take my scratched cd to my PC , burn it and take it back to my mac mini and then try to import it . I said , ok , so my cds should work on other computers , but not the mini ? and he kept saying how it was my cds and not the mini . I asked him if i could return my mini and he said no because i had bought extras like more ram and bluetooth . so i got off the phone with him and called back again . The next tech support " help " also told me there was nothing wrong with the computer but i could return it ( but not exchange it because there was nothing wrong with it ) . He transferred me to someone who told me i could exchange it , which i did . Now , my next mini comes in the mail , without my bluetooth and airport extreme options . " Oops , sorry " , they say , " we can return it and we 'll send you another mini . " I took it to my local store and they very nicely installed them for free in 45 minutes . So , now with less enthusiasm for my new purchase , i took my mini home , and tried out the optical drive again , which again had troubles . Now i should mention I took the same cd 's that wouldnt work on my mini , and they worked on my PC and on my friend 's mac . I called back the apple store and all they would give me for compensation was a return for my mini ( not the $ 60 keyboard i can no longer return at the store ) and $ 100 credit for my next apple purchase . I said sorry , that 's not enough for the hassle that i will probably go through again . Never , never again will I buy an apple product . This whole hassle lasted for most of a month , and it is still not over yet . Time for me to buy another reasonably priced PC . My mac friends are all about their mac 's , but first impressions are lasting , aren't they ?  
2	  At the age of 79 , I decided to try for the first time to build my own computer . I had been reading the website Ars Technica for some time which periodically posts recommended parts / components for doing this . However , my desk has a built-in space for the computer chassis allowing the case width to be no more than 7.5 inches , and the Ars Technica recommendations , despite my appeals to the editors , have never included a case this narrow . So I did some research on my own , and found that the Thermaltake Matrix VX chassis , whose dimensions fit my needs , had received some good reviews . I bought it along with components recommended by Ars Technica . I think it is handsome , has all the room I needed , but ( 1 ) thank God I read the reviews which explained , as the incompetent manual did not , that it was necessary to remove the internal brace bar ( easy to do ) in order to install some components in the case ; and ( 2 ) it took me hours to figure out ( no help from the manual ) how to remove front panel bay covers to install CD / DVD drives . ( As one reviewer , with no further explanation , put it : : " It is not difficult , but is not intuitive , and a novice could easily break it . " An email to the company website asking for help with this problem was never answered . ( From inside the front panel , you need to put your thumbs on the edges of the bay cover and push outward . Simple IF YOU 'RE PROPERLY INSTRUCTED . )  
2	  I received the Monster Cable SS-4 Speaker Selector the other day and was doubtful when I first opened the package . DON'T BE ! This is an excellent product and is better than advertised . It was easy to install , works great , clear sound , no decrease in power . Had no problem with the speaker connections clamps , used 16 gauge wire . Shop around for best price , but would be hard to beat at any price .  
2	  The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because of the awkward way you have to charge the palm ; either remove it , or leave it partly open with the weight of the palm pushing on the cord / outlet connection . In any case ( ha ! ) it was certainly worth the money , as I would have destroyed the palm , or a less sturdy case by now .  
1	  Got this camara and only use it once in a couple months , and suddenly the LCD screen shows only white screen , i talked to Sony customer support and got the answer that does happen sometime and have me to ship it back to them under the warranty . A week after sending it back i got a phone call from Sony saying that was a physical damage and the LCD is cracked . When i asked if LCD is cracked and the light can still be on ? the guy couldn't answered only saying that the information will not be change , I told him it 's not crack and there is not even a scratch on my camara anywhere because i don't really use them . and again , all he reply is " the information is not going to change " When i ask to speak to somebody else and again i got " the information is not going to change " , I start wondering if i was talking to a machine or a live person . And i ask again to speak to somebody else he said there 's only him .. A whole Sony company has only 1 person working ? for a 10 mins call all i can heard from this guy is " the information is not going to change " and he just hang up on me . For whole 15 years i only buy Sony electronic and all i got is " the informations is not going to change , there 's only me no one else in Sony " .. lol ~  
2	  Osram box stock 64514 lamp . Clear , not frosted . You should be able to find them for less than $ 6 . Do NOT use long life bulbs as they are not as bright .  
1	  I don't like writing a lot , so I will keep this simple and to the point . To summarize : this is not a very good camera .. at all . I first saw this camera at staples and being one of the cheapest cameras drawled me into purchasing . All I really wanted was a simple point and shoot camera and I believed that HP could handle that . I was mistaken . * This camera eats batteries even with the LCD screen off * The pictures are almost always blurry / soft even with shutter at max - I almost never get a good sharp picture * It has a slow start up and very slow write and read * Video is awful , both in video and sound - plus no speaker * Too many menus make it very confusing and time consumingThe only thing that I liked about it was the simple fact that it took SD cards which isn't saying very much . Also , this camera brakes very easily . I put a small force on the extended lens and it jammed and refused to retract . I was also talking to someone with the same camera that said they returned theirs 4 times for the exact same reason . I am very displeased with this camera and do not recommend it in the least bid . My advice would to spend a few extra dollars and get something nice that will last . I am looking into the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ4 .  
1	  Bought this in 12/2011 from Amazon . Bought it to improve AM reception for my Sangean WR2 radio that i use in a 2 story office building . The WR2 would only get 3-4 AM stations and they were all staticky . I am in a corner office with large windows . I screwed wire to back of radio and set antenna on window ledge . Didn't improve reception that good . Was able to get maybe 2-3 more stations but still all stations came in staticky . Maybe it will work in your building or home but not good for my location / use so i returned it .  
2	  I have had so many bad routers all I really wanted was for this one not to crash and burn on a daily basis . This one has exceeded all of my expectations . Set up was so simple my 10 yr old could have done it . The signal strength is so strong I can walk down the street from my house and around the corner before I lose it , I have not had one issue . Love it !  
1	  It seemed to be a bargain for the price , but I suspect that I got what I paid for . The unit has quite a few annoying " features " : it replays disks exactly 1 hour after you stop them - I found this on the first night when Al Pacino woke me out of a sound sleep after I left the DVD in the player . The setup IS frustrating because the manual doesn't match the firmware - they changed the user interface and shipped the manual for the old one . The menu system is modal - you have to be in tuner mode to set the clock , that option doesn't appear in CD / DVD mode . Of course the manual tells you to press the " setup " button to get there but the remote has a " menu " button . Bad translations abound .. anyone care to move any more of this work offshore ( That 's probably not fair , how did I expect them to offer this product at this price ) ? The eject button doesn't interrupt when you turn the unit on and press eject - the unit still spins the disk all the way up and inspects it for about 15 seconds . Oh , don't even think of putting a mildly scratched CD in it - it doesn't deal with that well at all .. sounds like a 33 played on 45 . I 'm sending it back because of the 1 hour delay thing and they told me that the 928 is discontinued so they 'll be replacing it with the newer model . I can't wait to see what I get with that .. - oh and I pay the shipping to them .. about 15 % of the purchase price - a small system but still 61 pounds . I wonder if I 'm going to wish I had just spent the extra money up front when all is said and done .  
1	  The first Zen we bought would not turn on at all . We used the Amazon return process and quickly received a replacement . In the meantime , I read the comment / review from " almosthappy " about how to charge the battery on a player that was Dead on Arrival . The second player was DOA as well . We followed his instructions and used a wall charger from an old CD player . Once the battery had enough charge we could boot up the player . It would be nice if Creative provided a wall charger with the MP3 player . ( One can be purchased as part of a pkg with a silicone cover , and a travel and wall charger . I found them on Amazon for ~ $ 26 . ) We have three Zens in our family and so far they seem to work well . We will have to reserve judgment until more time has passed . I recommend buying a decent set of earbuds if you find the ones that came with the MP3 player to be uncomfortable .  
1	  Unfortunately not as good as I hope it would be . Connector often gets stuck in the port , and with some systems ( ethernet cards ) just doesn't work at all ( surprised ? I was too .. ) .. i.e. doesn't go all the way into the port . I probably will have to cut the connector and attach a better one .  
2	  No problem with this battery . Some less expensive batteries for my Nikon 8400 have either not charged up or did not fit properly in the camera . No such issues here .  
1	  Thankfully I found my original TX stylus right after I ordered these . I didn't bother cancelling the order , because it 's nice to know I have spares immediately should I lose my original again . These things are very light compared to the original TX stylus , and writing with them is not nearly as comfortable as with the original . I never understood why you 'd really need a pen in your Stylus , so this is worthless to me . I haven't had any problems with the tip coming loose , but I don't really use these that often . I can definitely see how they 'd come loose when carried around . they are backup . I don't necessarily like them , but I 'd deal in the event I lost the original for good . Maybe I 'm just spoiled because the original TX stylus is nice and weighty and solid feeling . I feel like I could easily just bend these between my 3 fingers if I felt like it . Cheezy . Seriously Palm , why can't you sell exactly what comes with your Palms instead of this half hearted attempt ?  
2	  I purchased this item for my Granddaughter for Christmas . She has a Digital Camera and collects keychains . This seemed to be the perfect gift . She was very excited to get it . She didn't know that such a thing even existed . The Digital Photo part works perfectly , exactly as the directions say . What could go wrong with a keychain itself ? I couldn't be happier with a purchase . This was my first purchase from Amazon ! It definately will not be my last .  
1	  I have owned my player for barely 2 months . It was working great until it suddenly stopped playing . Condensation built up inside the screen while I was using it inside and it stopped . After a few hours , the condensation was a little better and it started playing again , but the display options don't work properly anymore . The customer help line told me to keep it in a dry place for 1 - 2 hours and let it dry out . It 's been " drying " for a week and the screen is still spotted and cloudy . The really cool design was the main reason I bought it and I thought a Sony was supposed to be good . Sony did make me the wonderful offer of exchanging my almost brand new player for a refurbished player of " comparable " quality . Still seeking satisfaction .  
1	  Most annoying piece of hardware that I have used . Pointer tracking , The most important of mouse 's function , it does a worse job .  
2	  I originally bought one of these from Foarm over a year ago . Not sure what happened to them , looks like they got bought out or something , but Gizzmovest is now making the same high quality case . I bought 4 of these for the gps 's at work . They fit over top of the gps very tightly , there is no movement of the gps in the case . It raises the surface of the gps so that the buttons and screen won't rub if you put it in your cruising vest chest pocket . It comes with 2 screen protectors too and they are of very high quality also . One of my employees decided not to use the case and ended up losing the battery cover , if he had used the case he now wouldn't be responsible for paying for a replacement battery cover ( FYI if you damage your gps , it costs just as much to send it in for a repair if it 's out of warranty then to buy a new one , at least in Canada , hopefully the service center in Canada will have the individual part for sale ) . Anyways , the case will definitely prolong the life of the gpsmap 76 's if it is used and it doesn't affect the signal of the gps at all in my experience ( I use a gpsmap 76 csx ) .  
1	  I 've had this router for about a year . It worked decently for a time . Recently , I noticed the numbers for the wired connections had turned orange . That 's odd , I 'm pretty sure they had been green . Yes , after checking my dad 's identical model , they were green . So I figured it had something to do with how hot the unit was getting . I had read others talking about overheating issues . I unplugged it and didn't use it for awhile . After plugging it back in , the numbers were back to green and everything appeared to be fine . Then came yesterday . The unit suddenly powered off , and I have not gotten it to turn back on since . I would open it up and tinker with it , but I 'm pretty sure it 's not worth my time .  
1	  COBY has the worst technical support ever . Thankfully the product interface is simple and if you try , and try and try again with file sizes , you do get to a reasonable end result , but if you try to call their technical support line , you will be very disappointed . They don't know their own product well enough to give clear guidelines on file sizes and resolution specs . Their only response is " It 's not a digital TV , so don't expect much " . Don't waste your time with a phone call to them , do your research on the web , even the info in this forum is more complete than at the COBY help line . I did buy and give 3 of these for Xmas , but I would never buy again from COBY and would tell others to avoid them too .  
2	  excelent product met all my expectations . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . .  
2	  this system is perfect if you like loud base and want alot of power out of your speakers . But these speakers aren't as clear as it i thought it would be from reading the reviews . i had a BOSE Companion 2 and i think those speakers sounds better than these , but they do lack base and loudness . but overall i am pretty satisfied with these ..  
2	  I was looking for a newer all in one printer that included fax and updates . The Amazon reviews of the ones I checked were from 1 to 5 stars . I decided to read the reviews of the printer I have been using over one year just to get a comparison . These reviews are all over the scale also so I decided to add my long term experience . When I bought the first one , it would not print envelopes so I took it back for another . The second one has worked well with good quality printing , scanning and copying . It has smaller ink cartridges than my older HP so cost per page is higher but it looks like most are going to smaller and smaller cartridges . I use it for my home office so it gets lots of use . I include photos and graphics on many pages of the limited quantity technical publications that I print . My customers and I have been happy with the output .  
2	  This is a quality product . I used it to replace a Trackman Marble FX . Because it is someshat different in shape it took a while to become comfortable using it .  
2	  We were overall pleased with this speaker , and we liked that it comes with an adapter cord so you can connect other MP3 players ( like my husband 's Sony ) to these speakers .  
1	  I can understand that this filter wont hold a common cap , lets say a Nikon original 72mm cap , because its very slim . But for me , the fact that the B & W cap that COMES WITH THE FILTER doesn't works neither is A FRAUD . What a joke ! B & W must alert you for the fact that there 's NO cap that holds on it . BIG desing mistake . Big shame . If you need a CPL for continous outdoor use , DONT BUY THIS SLIM CPL .  
1	  I tried everything but my laptop could not connect the internet . Maybe the problem was with the VISTA OS , but the company offered no fix .  
1	  I have an after market handle that serves as a lift for my computer to allow the bottom of it to breath , but it still doesn't cool it enough , and the fans still come on . So , I thought the Notebook Cooler might do the trick . One of the features that I was excited about were the really quiet fans that are supposed to blow away the heat from the bottom of the computer . Well , the fans aren't quiet , and it doesn't cool off my computer . In fact , the fans were as loud , or louder than my notebook 's fans . It also isn't very smart . You have to turn it on and off manually , instead of having a sensor that detects heat . The fans are loud , the internal design is lacking , and it really doesn't cool off the computer that much . In fact , it just blows warm air towards you if you 're sitting next to it . About the only thing that 's good about this is the aesthetic design . It 's cool looking , but not worth your money or your time .  
2	  The Zen V Plus is a great mp3 / video player for the price , the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is that display is a bit to small .  
2	  For the price of this lens you can't beat it . I love this lens and I can't believe what I paid for it . This is something I really feel I got my money 's worth and more !  
1	  This book was overly long , and it seemed like the original premise got lost in the story . Ms . Tartt can certainly write , but I felt the writing took over the story . Certainly the book jacket is misleading . What was the story she was trying to tell ? As others have mentioned , the ending is a non-ending . Was I disappointed .. most definitely !  
1	  The drive is speedy - no doubt about it . It had good features such as ability to create a secure and unsecure partition . But all its features are useless when the design of the product is flawed . As noted by others , the metal casing connects to a plastic ( right around the USB connection ) . That can break no matter how careful you are . When you pull the drive out of a USB port , you are applying pressure to this plastic part and it 's guaranteed to break at some point unless you 're 100 % careful all the time . It 's extremely fragile ! Having said that , I would not buy this drive if I had known this before .  
2	  This data traveler is good . I haven't had any problems with it at all . Easily save and open documents .  
1	  What can I say , you get what you pay for . The thought of extending my P712 's already amazing 12X zoom by 2.2X for a total of 26X was very attractive at this price point . Unfortunately , the optics fall far short of superb . Chromatic aberations abound despite the " HD " coating , and the sharpness drops off towards anywhere near to a third from the edge of the image . I had a pair of plastic binoculars as a child . The optics on this unit performs similarly . The price point is the real seller here . But if you 're interesting in taking sharp , high quality photos get the pricier , but infinitely superior Kodak telephoto for the P850 / P712 . To the seller 's credit , they did include the lens adapter . I may find a use for this lens , but can not really recommend it .  
2	  So worth the price . I 've used these batteries for about a year in rotation with my Canon batteries and I cannot tell a difference .  
1	  WORDS TO DESCRIBE SELLER AND TRANSACTION ? UNHELPFUL ; EVASIVE ; UNSYMPATHETIC .. Item never delivered - seller insists it was - proof of delivery proved it was'nt ! Seller refused to help referring me to Amazon . I won't be doing business with this seller again - it is up to you to make your own judgement .  
2	  IMO , U2 is the best Flash players around . What I like the most in my player ? -> Excellent sound quality ( default earbuds that come with the players don't match well with the player though - replace ' em with iPod 's and you will love it ! ) > Compact size > Line-in and Voice recording > FM Radio + recordingThe only thing I miss in the player is AM radio as I listen to Bloomberg radio every morning .  
2	  I 've been a Linksys owner for nearly 7 years , and I always enjoyed their products . But that time , I looked for a Gb router + N wireless . Then there is not much of a choice . Also it looks like the Linksys quality drops since they 've been acquired , so I decided to buy my first D-link . The overall experience so far is very positive . Very easy to setup via the web interface ( although some menus might look a bit confusing ) , it worked out of the box . I liked some minor features like binding an IP to a MAC address ( very usefull if you want to share a printer among several OS , including old Windows 2000 , who are not too good at detecting printers on the network ) makes managing your home office network easy . I notice that in mix mode ( N + A / B / G ) , windows 2000 will freeze or crash . No issue for windows XP , Vista , and Mac . Meaning , if you want to take advantage of the N-wireless , better to update your OS 's . There are plenty of customization that gamers will love , where you can prioritize network ressources to specific application . No use for me , but worth mentionning . I strongly recommend that product !  
1	  I bought these to replace the standard iPod and Sony ear buds . I was under the impression that I would get a much deeper bass response . I was wrong . The bass reproduction is simply horrid . I read somewhere there is a " break-in " period . I have found this not to be true . They sound just as bad after 50 hours of listening as they did brand new . This is my first pair of Sennheiser and am very disappointed . I know they are low-end headphones - but I expected more . My recommendation is to keep researching .  
1	  It appears that the high yield functionality of the # 34 cartridge isn't such a great deal after all . Rather than providing more ink , Lexmark has just dialed down the amount of ink dispensed per print . What comes out crisp black with regular # 24 cartridge appears dull gray with the # 34 ( we compared prints ) . Even worse , the quality settings in the printer software don't allow you to choose higher quality . As if these cartridges weren't already enough of scam now Lexmark will let you pay more for a lower quality product and not even make this difference clear in the product description .  
1	  I don't think the other person who reviewed this model was talking about the right model . This one doesn't have auxiliary USB ports ( just 2 for keyboard and mouse ) , nor does it require an AC adapter . That notwithstanding , I have almost nothing good to say about this switch . 1 ) Design : This is set up so that the input connectors go in one side , and the output cables go out the opposite side . Most USB switches have all the input and output on one side or two adjacent sides to decrease the obtrusiveness of the switch on your desk . Not this one . The design wizards who put this one together made sure it would be as awkward as possible . Because there are cables pulling from opposite ends , the switch stands up on its side and I have to yank it down every time I want to push the button . Which may be a contributing factor in problem # 2.2 ) Doesn't seem to have keyboard / mouse emulation . Every time I have to reboot one of the 2 computers connected to this switch , the switch will no longer " stick " on that computer . It will switch over for about 4 seconds , the mouse and keyboard never activate , and then it switches back to the other computer . It may just be that one of the 2 output cables is defective . At any rate , the only fix I 've found is to switch the output cables between the 2 computers . Then they 'll both work until I reboot one of them again . That sort of defeats the purpose of having a switch . If I wanted to switch peripherals every time I rebooted , I would have just kept doing that instead of wasting money on this junk . The one thing I do like about this switch is that you can plug your speakers into the switch and use the audio on both computers . However , there are other brands of USB switches that have that feature .. and I 'll be out shopping for one todayI only gave this one star because zero is not an option .  
2	  As if I needed more reason to watch TIVO and play video games . 6 months after purchasing the Bravia V-Series , I can't stop singing its praises . I have HD-Cable with DVR connected with red / blue / green inputs , an upscaling dvd player connecting to HDMI , and the a handful of other red / white / yellow connections . Pros : - Color and Clarity are exceptional-Sound is surprisingly good for built-in speakers-Channels and resolutions change with little delay-Effectively 180 degree viewable angle . ( I haven't measured , but everyone in the room gets a great picture ) - Loads of A / V inputs allow me to hook up all my toys at once . - Audio and video is customizable at each input allowing me to have one set of volume / color / contrast settings for my dvd player , and another for my video games . - Each input can be custom named in the menus . I don't have to remember what 's connected to " input6 " , I just select " Playstation " - Smart Zoom automatically expands low-def channels to fill the screen with minimal distortion . - Universal remote compatible . Cons : -I bought the mustang brackets whose hardware didn't exactly fit . ( Maybe I just couldn't figure it out ) But with some courage , everything got mounted . - Once wall-mounted , the 5 ( or so ) major inputs are inaccessible without bloodying your knuckles . I bought patch cables from radio shack to allow quick detaching of my playstation . Overall , this is a fantastic TV that is easy to use .  
2	  Living in an area with a lot of electrical interuptions and surges , this product protects all my important electronics . Easy to use and very reliable .  
2	  The tv arrived great and in a timely manner . It is great and my daughter loves it ! A +  
1	  I bought this item , used it for awhile and it worked OK . When I went to change PCs it didn't work anymore . No manual or drivers on the Logitech website because the product has been discontinued . How could they not support a product that is still on the shelves ? That 's the last Logitech product I 'll ever buy .  
1	  Plugged it in , it was fine . Went down to my computer 5 days later and the lights were off , no longer worked . Called IO Gear , took 5 days to get an RMA # so that I could send it back to them for repair . Dealer wouldn't take it back because I had it over a 7-day period ( took me a couple days before I installed it ) I 'm in Canada , so I have to pay extra shipping to US for repair . I don't think it is worth it , I 'll probably chuck it out and get another brand . Looks cool and I like the design , except for the base , but the quality is very poor . Glenn  
2	  I 'm loving this camera . I 'm a total amateur but I have a great love for photography and this camera is almost a little too much for me . I 'm learning how to use it slowly , it has many useful features and it always turns out beautiful results . The best is , with a bigger memory card ( 2 or 4 gigs ) you can put a bunch of beautiful VGA video on . Crystal clear , looks like Hi-def tv . There is NO lag time from pushing the shutter to the picture being taken , and you can just keep pressing the button and getting lovely shots in rapid fire . It 's got good image stabilizing if you 've got shaky hands , which I do . And with the way the price is here at Amazon , you can't get a better camera for the money , period .  
2	  I ordered this HK AVR 645 receiver from JR 's Music World using standard shipping . The receiver was delivered within 3 days in perfect condition . The AVR 645 is fantastic . The best sound I ever heard . If you compare specs with other receivers you may think the AVR is underpowered , rated at 75W / channel vs 100 + W / channel for most others . But you 'd be wrong . The AVR 645 is a very high powered receiver . Just compare the weight difference : 41 + lbs for the AVR 645 vs about 28 lbs for most other receivers . This isn't because of the cabinet - it 's the huge amp in the AVR . This baby puts out some power . I get postive comments from all our friends and family . Couldn't be happier !  
1	  I have used a cyberhome player for more than 18 months until my old player got damaged while I was moving to another location . As mentioned in the other reviews , Cyberhome is a very good player and it gives good value for your money . However , this particular series ( 300S ) has a problem . I got a player from Best buy and had to take it back as it used to " stall " on even very slightly scratched DVDs . I then got the same brand from Circuit City - Same problem . The common thing about both the players was the Series - 300S.Thankfully I did not have to pay anything as I had got the player from a store and returns were easy . Think twice before getting this particular model ( 300S ) of Cyberhome .  
1	  I bought this coupler to put two 25 ' phone cords together ( the cord between the hand set and the phone itself ) . We were always stretching a single cord beyond its limitations when talking on the phone . However , when using this coupler , I could not get a clear connection between two cords . I tested both cords ( at first I thought I had a defective cord ) but I determined the issue was with the coupler . Perhaps it just should be considered only for line cords ( between the wall jack and phone ) that do not have tension .  
2	  I have had no problems with the 16 GB Transcend SDHC card . Good price . Ordered and received in one week .  
1	  I hate this tripod , it is heavy and not stable at all . I think it needs to be tightend . It has very nice controls vertical and hirzontal  
1	  The card seems to be well-made , and the included documentation was sufficient for installing the card and doing minimal troubleshooting . As advertised , the card did fit in a PCI slot . However , when installed , my computer wouldn't boot . In fact , it wouldn't successfully complete the POST . I dutifully downloaded chipset updates for my motherboard and installed it in the slot formerly occupied by my sound card but still it wouldn't boot . There seems to be an issue with either the AMD 761 or VIA 686 chipsets on my motherboard . Others seem to have good luck with it , but I recommend avoiding it if you have an Athlon system with the AMD / VIA chipsets . I ended up returning this card and getting the D-Link DFE-530TX + , which works flawlessly .  
1	  I bought this mouse to use with my Dell Inspiron E1705 with integrated bluetooth . The computer recognized the mouse right away , however I could not install the software included with the mouse . The good : on / off buttom , long battery life , comfortable design . The bad : As pointed out by other reviewers , the device ' goes to sleep ' way too often . You have to jiggle and wait for the mouse to be activated almost constantly . This becomes quite annoying when you are working . I ended up returning it because I could not stand it . - Note added on 4/13/2006After returning the mouse I contacted Logitech and asked if there was a way to disable the stand-by mode . Here is what they had to say ( I haven't tried since I no longer have the mouse ) : Thank you for your recent inquiry about your Pointing Devices . I understand that the Logitech V270 mouse goes to sleep mode too often . Please note that the mouse will go to sleep mode if it is not used for few minutes to save the battery life . If you move the mouse or press the click button of the mouse , then it will come up from the sleep mode and then work as normal . However , if you would like to disable the mouse entering the stand-by mode , then refer to the following steps : a . Right click on My computer and select Properties . b . Click on Hardware Tab . c . Select Device Manager . d . Click the + sign next to Mice and other pointing device . e . Right click on the mouse you are using and properties . f . Click on Power Management Tab . g . Enable Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power . h . Click OK .  
1	  Like the other reviewers , the CD player on this thing died . The motor just grinds and grinds and scares the death out of my 4 year old . Like I fool , I bought another RCA clock but the sound quality on that was poor . Now the buttons on that one are stuck so I can't set the time on it after owning it for 6 months . Don't buy RCA .. not worth it ..  
2	  With all the computer peripherals and and other accessories around these days , there are not enough USB ports in a computer to accommodate all of them without having to unplug one thing in order to use another . This is also capable of charging items that are plugged into it ; not all hubs do this . I like the small size , sleek design , and the chord manager that is built into the housing of the hub . I also like the fact that there aren't a bunch of obnoxious LEDs in unit that don't indicate anything . There is just one small , not excessively bright , orange light that shows that it 's connected to power .  
1	  It took me over an hour to set up because there wasn't any specific direction to help me set up . I use Vista and over 3 year old manual doesn't mention anything . ( though , the box says it supports ) When I finally figured out and set up . It didn't really work better than my integrated laptop WLAN . It shows connections with more bars but i had hard time connecting and even after the successful connection , speed was slower than before . I 'm returning the item tomorrow .  
2	  I used this on a snorkeling trip in Maui , and was very pleased with the results . Pros : - Does what it 's supposed to do : keeps your camera dry under water . - Didn't have a noticeable impact on image quality . - Includes a good wrist strap . Cons : - While the buttons are relatively easy to access , any slider-switch or wheel controls are very hard to use while in the case . For my camera ( aCanon SD450 ) this meant mode switching was tricky . This wasn't a big deal for me as I rarely switch modes anyway , but you should check the controls on your camera to see which ones may be affected by this issue . - Does not provide any protection against pressure . So while it 's fine for snorkeling or swimming , it 's probably not a good choice for anything where you 'll be going really deep ( like scuba ) . - A bit scary to use , since there 's only a thin layer of plastic protecting your camera from destruction . Tips : - Test it in your sink or bathtub using some wadded up paper towel instead of a camera to make sure the case doesn't leak . It might be good to do this at the beginning of any trip just to make sure it hasn't gotten damaged since you last used it . - Also , make sure the lens cap is on good and snug , and that the " zipper " seal is completely engaged before going in the water .  
1	  I ordered the bag for the mbp 17 and it was horrible . the " protection " area could have fit 3 of my computer . it was swimming around ! no protection at all . I ordered it from radtech , and they were rude , mean , nasty people who don't stand by thier product . don't believe anything they say .  
2	  I hate snagless ends . They are a pain to unplug from computers in my opinion . However , if you are just going to plug this in and leave it , the cable is great . Since the cable is listed as snagless ( right ? ) I don't think I can knock a star off . I get full bandwidth between two gigabit adapters and have had no issues with reliability . Cat6 cables are a must have if you keep files on a home server , like to game , or share files with other computers at home . For this price you can't go wrong !  
2	  I purchased this to carry of my dvds in to save space when moving to college . Personally , I wish it was just a little cheaper , but you get your money 's worth .  
1	  I 'm very upset because I was in need of this flash ASAP . It said they item was in stock , I just purchased it yesterday and just recently received an email that the order was cancelled b / c it was OUT of stock . I will not be purchasing anymore from this user , due to this experience .  
2	  I bought this for my husband . He hasn't put it down since he opened it and can't wait to get out in the boat . It was exactly what he was looking for .  
1	  In a word , these suck . The sound is not much louder than spillover from a really loud set of headphones . Not worth the money . Utter crap if you 've got a Nano .  
1	  Very disappointed with these headphones , and even more disappointed in all the positive reviews that I read . The sound quality is average , nothing more . I tried these on my Ipod and Droid X phone . Neither sounded markedly better than the standard ear buds I was using before . The notable exception is the extra bass , which sounds ok . However , these headphones need a lot of power to drive them , so even with the iPod volume at max , they were not as loud as my other headphones . On an airplane , I had to keep these at max volume . If the only issue was the average sound quality , I would chalk it up to getting what I paid for ; at the end of the day , these are relatively cheap headphones . However , the biggest problem with these headphones is the design . First off , they look and feel cheap , like they may accidentally break in your hand or bag . When you go to fit them to your head , there is no way to lock the size , so the headphones constantly are sliding back to their default size . While they 're on your head , they will constantly shift and size smaller , grabbing your hair in the process and becoming more and more uncomfortable . Overall the worst purchase I 've ever made on Amazon of a product with a greater than 4 star rating . If only I had kept the box , I would love to return these .  
2	  My Gateway PC at work is getting a little long in the tooth ( still has Windows 98 on it ) , and the original 2.1 Boston Acoustics speakers just suddenly gave out ( possibly a cord problem ) . I was looking around for an inexpensive replacement , and I stumbled across the reviews for these bad boys . I am still a little puzzled as to why the same speakers cost more in a different box , but check out all variations listing the same speakers , and you can save money . I picked the ones in the white box with free shipping , but you can pay considerably more , including shipping , if you aren't careful . I have them set up on my desk , one small speaker to each side of my approaching antique status monitor . At first I had the sub down on the floor right next to me , against the wall . That proved a little boomy for my taste , and so I set the little box down on the other side of my desk , a little more out from the wall . I then set the small speakers to the normal listening level for my taste , turned the bass all the way down , and then slowly increased the volume until the bass seemed merely an extention of the satellites . You can tell if deep bass is playing , but you don't hear much until bass notes are played . I was duly impressed with the crisp high end , and the bass really sounded good for cheap speakers , but I did notice a little muddiness in the midrange . I used the equalizer on my media player to boost the midrange a bit . I haven't tried turning the bass all the way up and then decreasing the lowest frequencies with the equalizer , as one reviewer suggested , but I 'm going to try it to see how it works out . I also downloaded a free sound enhancer plugin for my media player , which acts much like the " loudness " control on my receiver , in that it slightly warms up or kicks the sound levels at lower volumes . I had to turn off the " megabass " feature for the plugin , but otherwise I found the sound improved and the soundstage seemed deeper , as if the speakers had gotten just a little bigger . My taste is for the sound to be natural and transparent , and although the short cords limit speaker placement , it 's probably worth trying several different arrangements of the satellites and the sub , to see what works best for you . As other reviewers have said , these will never sound as good as expensive speakers , but I do believe they sound as good or better than many systems I auditioned at twice or even three times the price I paid ( $ 37 delivered ) . They more than lived up to my expectations , and I am highly satisfied with the sound . The real danger is that the sound does not clip or distort at high volume , and you can hurt your ears by accidentally playing the speakers at higher volumes too close to your ears . I have my own office with a closed door , and I got comments ( if not quite complaints ) about how far the sound carried , when I first began to use them . They might not be suitable for those in a cubicle . In short , I am totally happy I bought these , and I recommend them for anyone who needs better sound than the little " full range " speakers that come standard with some PC 's , but who can't justify spending $ 100 or more .  
1	  These connectors are useless because they are so large ! For any given pair of speaker posts , whether on my receiver , in-wall outlets or on the speakers themselves , it was a real trick to get the nut tightened and still keep the connectors from touching each other . For the receiver and the in-wall outlets , one pair of these connectors effectively knocked out four posts because they obstructed access to the adjacent pair .  
1	  I had purchased a 6 Quart and was very happy about the usage and ease of use from the get-go . so I just decide to purhase a 4 Quart one to cook for smaller meal and as an entra set to speed my cooking process when I need two for a meal . This 4 Quart is a bummer from the beginning . First of all , the handle design is much wider in hand-grip area for a female comparing with a 6 Quart , and as a female I can tell you I have relative big hands not those petite ones . ( which I want to ask and wonder WHY is it needed to be that way in the first place if it does not need more pressure or bigger pot than the 6 Quart in size ? ) . Then , you can not close the lid with ease which is the most important and fundamental part for a Pressure COOKER ! No kidding ! I followed their instruction on you have to press down the Opposite end at beginning to close until it get lose after USE . Ok , regarding this point , I have to ask for the following questions1 ) does it make sense if the 6 quart does not have to have this procedure when I bought it in around January 09 , why now this 4 Quart need to do so ? why in design , they are essentially the SAME THING ? if supposedly this more recent design comparing with what I bought a year ago ? 2 ) after we tried to close it about 50 times or more just to see if it would make it loose and easier for daily use , so far we have not able to see it is any easier than the 1st pressure cooker I bought over a year ago , the 6 Quart one in year 2009 . Ultimately , I just do not get it as an Engineer myself that if a new product NEEDS CUSTOMER TO WORK AT IT TO MAKE IT SEAL EASILY AND BETTER , it is something wrong about the manufacturing thinking process ! After all , Presto is able to make a 6 Quart model I bought a year ago works more smoothly . So , my question is then followed on : What happened to this NEW related model ? for the 4 quart now ? Why there is a Green insert to make note to customer that you have to have this special process for a customer to keep working at the lid to make it seal until you use it for sometime ? I do not know if they now change the 6 Quart for the handle and lid also like the 4 quart ? this is the 2nd replacement I got , I will keep for a few days to see how it works out and may have to return it if it continues to not work out . I am not happy about the changes on the 4 quart one the lid-closure as well as the handle grip change ! Li  
1	  Too much bass response and the sound is muffled really bad . The price is good and the noise blocking is good but if you want really good sound quality , get something else .  
2	  For the price I paid , I am quite happy with this product . While sometimes the headphones are jostled when I am running and slip , most of the time they stay put . Especially for somebody who cannot use regular ear buds when running , these headphones fit and stay on my head . They seem a bit flimsy but , hopefully they will last long .  
2	  My 2003 Corolla comes fully equipped with a tape player for all of my cassette tape-listening needs ( except .. who plays cassette tapes anymore ? ! ) My car also lacks any other ways to connect my iPhone to my stereo so the tape adapter was the way to go . I 've had two other tape adapters over the past 7 or 8 years and they have both worked wonderfully ! And this adapter is no exception ! It is a lot more reliable than an FM transmitter because there isn't any static and I think that the sound quality is pretty good . It will sometimes make a quiet whirring noise like the little wheels are turning but it 's really not that noticeable when music is playing . I really love having this adapter because I rarely listen to the radio and needed a way to listen to my favorite music again !  
1	  Should have taking the warning from another review more seriously . Single din deck wont even fit inside of this without trimming the plastic ( Tried 2 separate decks ) . Had a buddy come over that does this for a living and he told me this wasn't going to work . Throwing this piece of junk in the garbage and picking up a Metra .  
2	  Excellent B + W 77mm Clear UV Haze with Single Coating ( 010 ) . I am very satisifed with the prodict and the service .  
2	  Purchased it so I don't have to buy batteries all the time , great price . Only thing different is the weight of the controller but you get used to it !  
1	  POS Panasonic . Anything on this thing that could break , has , - display , power supply , DVD drawer motor , now the LED laser to read the discs has failed . I 've been buying used systems from Ebay to keep this thing going . Luckily ( maybe not so lucky ? ) I have the skills to repair it . I 'd venture to guess that all Panasonic stuff in this price range is junk , it 's made like crap on the inside . I paid $ 400 new for this thing from Best Buy ( probably not a best buy either ) which is a lot of money for me . An additional $ 200 would have bought an equivalent Sony at that time . Panasonic used to make decent stuff , not any more . Should have bought the Sony . Now that it is junk I could set it on fire in the fire ring in my yard to torch it , but it probably won't even do that well . Buy Sony and save yourself some grief .  
2	  I am not a heavy user of this web cam . However , when I do use it I am very satisfied . It 's a web cam . I am not trying to make a movie with it . It is my first web cam and couldn't be happier . It is not plug and play . But I do not jump from computer to computer , so that 's alright . Well worth the money . You will not be disappointed .  
1	  I had been thoroughly enjoying this TV for the past year . It has offered sharp picture , great sound , and truly was a great bargain . This was until about a month ago , when the TV lost picture out of the blue . It still powered on and played sound , but no picture . I sent it in for a warranty repair but they can't seem to locate the part needed at this time .  
1	  Like another reviewer , my battery just failed to charge . This happened within six months . It was never dropped or damaged . It 's just a piece of junk .  
2	  I 've owned many transmitters in my days and this one is the best . It does not directly support 87.9 but by holding the last two preset buttons down , you can dial 87.9 in . Very little if any static . Best 40 dollars i 've spent for my ipod .  
2	  So far , so good . Can't beat the price when you consider you 're getting two 2400mah batteries . Love the abilty to use AA batteries if I get in a pinch . I have the grip attached to a Rebel XTi and love the way it feels as apackage . Stabilizes the platform well .  
1	  I bought these headphones because they had camo on them . I 've had them for about 6 months now , and they 've already fallen apart even though I rarely use them because of the shoddy construction and materials . The sound is merely OK compared to other full size headphones . Everyone that 's seen me with these headphones thought they looked nice though , and they keep your ears warm in the winter ( one of the reasons why I wear headphones outside in the winter instead of earbuds ) . But they 're broken now . DO NOT BUY .  
2	  I found out that I ordered the incorrect version of the power strip ( 20 amp ) . I called the company , since it is in my area , and they replaced it . I am very pleased with the strip because it meets a great need I had for my business .

1	  I have experienced the same problem as the rest of the comments . The machine won't allow a CD to be inserted . Troubleshooting at 1-877-210-3782 said to merely uplug - wait one minute and then plug in . Dah ! That didn't work . CD goes in about 2 inches and hits a wall of some kind . Told to ship to So . Carolina - pay shipping and approx . $ 100.00 to repair . To have no buttons on any machine is just plain annoying ! What if you misplace the remote ! A Really stupid machine . Comments go back to 2009 - why doesn't Bose fix the problem !  
2	  This backpack is great , there of good quality and plenty of padding for those bumps in life . the pocket could be positioned better and could be sized better . other than that great pack for your small note book computer .  
1	  Yes , these headphones are about $ 10 . Yes , they work good enough to listen to tunes or TV while you workout . However , these headphone will only last you for about 6 months . After 6 months , one of the ears will go out . Listening to music and TV through one ear is very annoying , as I am sure many of you will confirm . I have gone though about half a dozen of these same headphones in my lifetime and all of them have ended up in a landfill . Why did I go through half a dozen of these headphones you ask ? 1 . I am a cheap mofo . 2 . I trusted you Sony ! Do your wallet and the Earth a favor and spend a little extra money for good quality headphones which will last you for years to come . I know I learned my lesson .. the hard way . On a side note , the chord on these headphones are little short , so plugging them to the TV on a treadmill at a gym creates a little discomfort that you will get used to .  
1	  Memory Stick works fine . Initially the adaptor that came with the packet didnt work . I complained with Amazon who redirected me to the seller itself . Seller promptly sent me another adaptor which were two in number , neither of them worked again . I tried by using the adaptor with multiple computers , story remains the same . Even though i am fine with the service provided , the quality of the product is not at all good .  
2	  Another member of Sharp 's unbeatable LCD TV family : 1 . Great LCD panel : 32 " diagonal , vivid colors , stunning clarity , very good black-level quality , no dead pixels ( cheaper brands often have dead pixels ) 2 . Great styling : looks absolutely beautiful , in the living room or bedroom or your fancy bathroom3 . Lots of inputs : digital inputs , component inputs , PC input . HDTV tuner is not built-in , though , so you 'll need a separate HDTV tuner , which is fine since you likely need to get an HDTV cable or satellite service like VOOM anyway4 . Simplicity : the set-top connector box hides all the wires5 . Easy to set up and useBTW , the " 32GD4U " model ( with a D ) has a built-in HDTV tuner , but it 's also hundreds more . This present model ( without the HDTV tuner ) is definitely the better value .  
2	  I am a truck driver by trade and I had one before and it was great I used it till it wore out and brok on my one day . ; I could never find another one till now and I am buying one because this AX-2 is by far the best bluetooth I have ever had . I was lost when my other one broke on me it worked so well . I have a minor hearing loss in both ears and this gives me the best hearing of phone conversations of any bluetooth I have ever used . If you buy one buy 2 to have a spare they are that good .  
1	  After reading the reviews of Bose noise cancelling headsets ( QC2/3 ) , I decided to give the Shure E4c a try . I arrived at the airport earlier so that I have time to try things out . The earphone sounded just fine on their demo CD player . I didn't try it on my laptop , which is a mistake . On the airplane , I put this earphone is real test . Of course , the " sound isolation " works , ( put a piece of memory form in your ear , it will block the sound ) , but when I listen to some real music like the " Carmen - Act 1 Prelude " , the bass was totally cutoff . My broken $ 60 worth of Panasonic headset did so much better than this one . Besides the sound problem , I don't feel comfortable at all with it . As soon as my plan landed on the run way , I called the store , and they are kindly let me to return in Huston airport ( where I transit ) . I found their store , and the salesman listen my test music and had to agree with me and accepted return . ( GREAT SERVICE ! ) I ended up with Bose QC3 , which I am VERY happy with . My recommendation to everyone is to try this one with your own music source and pay attention to the peak bass performance . They have a great customer service and you can buy with confidence . But the little thing may or may not work for you .  
1	  First , the good news : the Rio Cali has some excellent advantages over the other mp3 players I looked at . First , it 's the only one rugged enough for sports ( I take mine snowboarding and jogging ) , the yellow and black design intentionally recalling the old Sony Sportsman , I think . The arm band and belt clip give you a number of options for carrying it , and both work fine . Also , it 's tiny and light and slips easily into your pocket . The player is extremely easy to use with loads of great features . The simple joy stick ; the language options ; a fully adjustable graphic equalizer ( a must for me ) ; date , time , and radio options for Europe , Japan , and the US ( I travel to all 3 a lot ) . The radio is a big selling point , with 8 presets . One surprise feature I love is an " adjustable " key guard lock : you can lock the power button and joystick , but keep the volume free for adjusting . This is just great ! Add to that that the volume up / down buttons are different sizes and shape with a raised " plus " sign on the volume up , so you can feel which is which in your pocket . A lot of good thought went into the design . The screen is big and easy to see with lots of nice information , and there 're plenty of options for timing its illumination , and also a power-save auto-off feature . The biggest selling point is its expandability : you can slip up to a 512K SD memory card in there to make room for a couple hundred more songs . Never mind that the card will cost more than the player . The software it comes with is well organized , intuitive , and easy to use , or you can use Windows Media Player , take your pick . Now the bad news : first , file organization is a little poor . A folder system would be nice . Instead , you get play lists ( which , if you add a whole album to , the songs get alphabetized and thus out of order ) or bookmarks . Bookmarks would be great , except you can't name them . You have to remember what was bookmark 1 , 2 , etc . Perhaps they can fix this with a firmware update ( which is updatable from their website ) . Lastly , and most importantly is the sound : there was a lot of " operational noise " when a song was playing - this had nothing to do with the quality of the sound file , but came from the player . The sound was also a bit flat and tinny - very disappointing . I took it back to the store and exchanged it for a new one , but had the same problem as the first . The other features made it nice enough for me to keep , but especially on quiet songs , I was annoyed . Then I tried some higher quality headphones to check if that was the problem , and indeed it was - with better headphones , the sound was crystal clear , the tones rich , and the equalizer even more effective without any tinniness . SO . For the price it can't be beat , especially if you 're using it for sports as it was intended , or for travel . But to get it up to snuff with the more expensive players out there , you 're going to have to invest in better headphones for sure ( good quality , say 50 bucks minimum ) if you want to appreciate digital clarity in all its glory , and the SD card ( another 150 for 512K ) if you 're lazy about swapping out songs . With the upgrade , I 'm completely satisfied aside from the bookmarks / folder issue , which could conceivably be solved with software in the future . Still a delight to use straight out of the box if the little whine in the background on quiet songs doesn't bother you too much . Recommended . PS It 's been 4 months since I bought it , and I was wrong about the sound with new head phones : that back ground buzz is STILL there . Why has no one else complained about this ? The sound was there on BOTH players I bought . You can really hear it when you play an MP3 with the volume all the way down . The buzzing is LOUD . So , I take it all back . The features are great , but in the end , it 's the sound that counts .  
2	  First one had a power supply problem . Amazon replaced it very fast . All in all a great unit .  
2	  I bought this charger for use with my digital camera ( Canon Powershot ) . I love it , it charges relatively quickly and shuts off when fully charged so there is no risk of over charging the batteries . I have not noticed the unit becoming hot or even warm during charging as someone else comented on . It is very compact which makes it easy to travel with . As it has dual voltage with the right converter you can use it anywhere . I have used mine in Ireland , England and New Zealand with no problems . The ability to charge either 2 or 4 batteries is also a nice feature . In my camera the batteries have what I find to be a good amount of life before they need to be recharged . I have accidentally popped the cover off when opening but it pops back on just as easily . I am completely satisfied with this charger and batteries for digital camera usage and recommend it .  
1	  Let me preface this review by saying I have Been around electronic navigation devices for years . I currently own a Garmin Etrex Handheld , and a Garmin 2620 Both have been flawless . I bought the Magellan 6000t because of the traffic functionality and I liked the graffic display . I paid full price when it came out around $ 599 at Best Buy . I have owned it now for 6 months here is the laundry list of problems . I DO HAVE THE LATEST FIRMWARE UPDATE . Which seems to be 1 every 2 months . 1 . ) If unit over heats ( sun ) or is too cold , unit will shut down . Needs along time to reset . 2 . ) When the un it shuts down it actually resets itself and loses all and anything stored , YES THATS MEANS ALL SAVE WAYPOINTS , ADDRESSES , ETC . 3 . ) # 2 above happens daily so why bother to store anything . 4 . ) Takes for ever to aquire satellites ( start up ) unless you are in an open field . 5 . ) Bought the traffic subscription , only problem is it doesn't work . You have to enter this rediculously long code to tell the unit you are a subscribing member . Only problem is the unit doesn't remeber the code , so I have to enter this 30 something long ID code every time I start up the unit and drive if I want the traffic to work . 6 . ) You have to fully charge the unit in order to connect to your computer , pain b / c unit only comes with car charger . 7 . ) Lost touch screen functionality after 4 months . After talking to India for several hours they told me to send it in . I know I 'll probably never see it again . Trust me .. buy a Garmin . Never had 1 problem let alone 7  
1	  This product was working great , for about a week . After the 5th day , I went to turn it on so I could use my laptop and it wouldn't turn on . I tried on a few occasions and different USB ports and it still didn't work . I would not recommend this for people that actually carry their laptops around and don't just sit them on a desk .  
2	  It wasn't the easiest thing to transfer photos from a computer and to delete the " samples " on the frame was no picnic either , but once learned it becomes easier . I went from frustrated to happy , soon enough .  
1	  This is not a multi coated filter . Using this on your lens makes the picture quality come down by 2 notches . If any direct sunlight hits the glass ( even if the sun is not withing the picture frame ) , the whole picture appears washed out . I only bought this because I got this free with my lens purchase . I always buy the sigma multicoated filters for my lenses . They are truely multi coated and reflect a dim green just like the expensive camera lenses . Unfortunately tiffen does not make any true multi coated lenses .  
2	  I have a Canon Elura 100 camcorder and an Olympus Camedia C-3040 digital camera and this case holds them both , plus the assessories needed when traveling - extra batteries , tapes , memory cards , connection cords and such , all in a case about the size of the lunchbox I carried as a kid .  
2	  The Zune is awesome . I find both the player and marketplace extremely user friendly . The player is very high quality as I have dropped it a few times and it still works perfectly . It integrates quickly and easily with my Xbox 360 and allowed me to free up tons of hard drive space that I had tied up with music . It is a great alternative to the very trendy Ipod .  
1	  I don't see that others had this problem but my unit was a dud . First , the plug was defective . I had to use the plug from my cell phone ( luckily this unit uses standard USB plug-in ) . Second , the remote will only work for a few functions and then I need to reset it again ( by pushing a pin-hole button on the bottom of the unit ) . Extremely frustrating . It could be that the remote problem is related to the defective cord , but I can't see how that would be the case . I like the concept of the unit and will likely replace . Hope the next one works .  
2	  This is my second Harmony remote . I think these are the best ! My previous 3 year old unit broke after being dropped one to many times . I ordered the XBOX version to better control my xbox and media center PC . I went online and the Harmony software converted my settings to the new remote in just a couple minutes . No fuss , no worries - GET A HARMONY  
2	  I got my Zune for Christmas .. almost 2 months ago , and I have to say I love it so far . At first though , it takes a little bit of effort to keep your songs in albums you want on your Zune . The software changes the song information to incorrect information sometimes , and takes it out of the album you already had it in the Zune . But you can turn the option to update song information off .. did that no prob . Next , if you want to make sure every song stays in the same album folder .. you have to make sure the song information for every song in that album is exactly the same , besides the title of the song of course . When you first get it and are learning this it is time consuming . Now if you have the patience and get through this , you 'll enjoy your Zune . This is definitely something you need to learn to use before truly enjoying it . I 've watched videos on it , the screen is great .. though watching the videos drains the battery quicker , which by the way I don't think it 's as long as they say .. definitely less than 12 hours of listening . But I love it , it 's easy to locate your music , photos , videos .. the radio is unbelievable , I live in New York and was listening to a radio station from Chicago on it . My friend 's wife has one , and she got signal from a radio station in Tokyo .. wow ! It 's easy to navigate , the only thing that I really wasn't too fond of was the look .. this thing is pretty ugly . I 'll give that edge to Ipod , but that 's about it . Which by the way reminds me , I 've downloaded music into my Zune from CD , and the net , and haven't even used the Zune website yet . That goes to all you Itunes slaves ;)  
2	  The player is awesome ! Light , compact and user friendly . I do not like the big bud style headphones and have since purchased in ear buds and it sounds great !  
2	  My fiance was bugging me for awhile for the japanese talking car alarm . I searched and searched and found this . It is loud and sensitive . Its actually pretty cool and no one around here has it . i do feel a little sorry for the neighbors if a cat jumps on the navigator though .  
1	  I would not put my camera on this tripod . It is very flimsily constructed , the center pole regularly comes disconnected , the handle for raising the top bar appears like it will fall off any day . I would not recommend this product . The only use I could have for this would be using this as a table tripod , and not risk damaging my camera or speedlite .  
1	  We bought a 6Gb Rio Carbon Pearl which failed with a broken thumbwheel in 70 days . After 3 weeks ( 18 May - 6 June ) Rio support come back to me with this line : Unfortunately broken scrollwheels / powerbuttons are not covered by the warranty . We do not do off warranty repairs . The is due to fact that repairing and shipping a Rio is more expensive than a new player . I think the most telling point is the comment that this company has poor reputation at the Better Business Bureau .  
1	  If this DVD player worked as advertised it would be a great unit and I do like the space savings aspect . The main problem I have is that the DVD player has difficulty accessing menus on some DVDs . It displays the menus wrong and won't allow selection of some items . Another annoyance seems to be with the actual decoding of the DVD during playback . Usually during the course of a movie there will be one or more glitches , which amount to a slight pause or skip . Sometimes the video appears scrambled momentarily . Worst of all , the unit I have seems to hang up or get into a mode where it doesn't respond to any buttons ( even the power switch ) . To correct this problem I have to unplug it from the wall outlet to cycle power . ( Really inconvenient ! )  
2	  I have been pleased to date with my purchase . The vendor got me the unit timely and so far no problems . It has been everything it was advertised to be .  
1	  If your computer runs windows vista 64bit or the new windows 7 , DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ! It will not work . Since this is a bi-directional server , you must install a virtual USB port on each oomputer . This software will not install on 64bit computers . You are then left with sending your print jobs to the servers IP address which is a ) one way only so forget about that fancy printer / scanner you have and b ) will not work anyway . This unit refuses to work as a traditional print server . The box and web site both say vista supported . I called customer service and spoke to a level 1 tech . He did not know what a print server was . Level 2 was no better . Level 3 began to tell me how I could set it up on a TCP / IP port . I explained I wanted the bi-directional function I PAID FOR , and he said he thought he had a solution and would call back in a hour . That was three days ago .  
1	  I purchased this system so that my son 's pc , 75 feet away from our Linksys WRT54G2 V1 WiFi router / switch could get better connectivity . My son , 14 years-old , did the set up by himself , it was easy . Unfortunatly no connection . I connected my laptop to one of the units . Going " mobile " , I was able to get very good ethernet connections 5 feet away and 35 feet away from the router . BUT NO connection at 70 feet away . I am headed back to store to purchase a TrendNet TEW-AI86D antenna booster . Failing that , I 'll upgrade to 802.11n .  
2	  I think very highly of the quality craftsmanship as well as the technological achievements present in this emergency AM / FM radio . It has the most efficient crank mechanism on the market and comes complete with an AC / DC adapter charger , a telescoping antenna , a large and good quality speaker , a single and bright LED flashlight , a separate LED for indicating the optimal charging crank-rate ( that also makes a decent night-light and also shows that external AC power is being supplied to the unit ) as well as a solar panel for both charging the internal batteries and also providing sufficient power to still operate the radio normally . The crank operates equally well using either a clockwise ( cw ) or a ccw rotation too so even if you forget , you can't damage it by turning the crank the wrong way ! As advertised , 30 seconds of cranking gives 35 minutes of medium volume listening ( or 25 minutes of loud volume levels ) and the listening time increases proportionally if you crank it even longer . The system is totally analog , lacks weatherband , shortwave , aircraft as well as TV bands . but is nonetheless quite useful as well as readily affordable if you wait for a sale . Freeplay also makes a much more expensive digital model with shortwave bands as well , but it is very hard to build all these as quality features including a digital PLL ( Phase locked loop ) synthesized radio for a reasonable price that people will also buy . My advice is too stick with a much simpler , quality made device that you know will work reliably in a pinch when it is really needed . One really nice feature for example is that the FM antenna can be simply stored in the radio when not being used , but when it is needed it can easily be fully extended . This also greatly reduces the chances of it being broken off inadvertently in an emergency situation in my opinion . The analog vernier dial is very easy to tune for both AM / FM and allows an extra large amount of turning to easily and precisely tune the am / fm bands . The volume control on the side controls all available bands . It also has a jack for a earphone / headphone during quiet times . Finally the provided charger can also be left plugged in indefinitely because after the first 24 hours of preconditioning the battery pack ( sealed internal Nickel Metal Hydride batteries ) , it will continue to keep them fully charged until the advent of an emergency by trickle charging ( by applying only very small amounts of current ) . In the meantime you can feel completely free to use it as an everyday quality and very enjoyable listening device . Most of all I like how totally reliable and redundant the many independent systems are on this radio . For camping and roughing it , it would have been better if Freeplay had provided a carrying strap for the radio ( to attach to the provided eyelet ) just for something to grab quickly , but for general household emergency purposes it is just fine . Of course you can always add your own strap if you feel that you require it for camping , etc . In a real emergency however you will be very glad to have purchased this quality instrument in my opinion . Finally I intend to buy several more of these units for my immediate and extended family members who really need this device .  
1	  PURCHASED A QUITE EXPENSIVE SAMSUNG DVD PLAYER WITH MEMORY STICK READER . IT STOPPED READING THE DVDS ABOUT 1 MONTH AFTER WARRANTY EXPIRED . SAMSUNG WAS NOT HELPFUL AT ALL . ON THE BRIGHT SIDE , IT STILL WAS ABLE TO READ THE MEMORY STICK .  
1	  I purchased 2 of these to put in two different Chevrolet trucks and it did not fit either one as stated it would . The antenna plug is different and will not work . Do a thorough check before ordering this product .  
2	  Great cables at a great price . Very easy to plug in and remove . My previous cables were difficult to remove and the tabs on them would snap off . No such problems with Belkins . The cable themselves are very resilent and can stand up to being stepped on or pinched under doorways .  
1	  I purchased this product several months ago from someone else . FM worked great and I loved all the features . One day I put in a CD and all I got was a no disc message . I sent it back as defective and was sent another one . It behaved exactly the same way . Because both had come directly from Japan , I thought something might have happened during shipping or perhaps something wasn't correct for Stateside use . Because I really loved the size and features , I wanted to try one from Target . After reading the reviews , I 've changed my mind . I 've always associated Sony with quality products but not anymore . I really appreciate the opportunity to read other opinions and make informed choices .  
1	  Received radio 2 days ago ( 12/1/09 ) Installed the next day . Has not functioned properly yet . Had it checked out by a professional radio installer and he recommended that I return it and ask for a replacement .  
1	  Impressive picture quality in HD . Not so hot for non-HD signals - my 15 yr old sony crt looks better . Also , it 's slow to switch between signal inputs . Minor gripes , I 'd still probably give it 4 stars , except for the quality issues below . First we had the same buzzing power supply that everyone else had . Now , it has completely died . I 've had it 1yr and 2wks . When you turn it on , the screen flashes for a moment and goes black . Samsung says they should be able to extend the warrenty for 1 month to get it repaired . Hoping a tech can come by soon .. I was planning on this tv lasting 10yrs ! At this rate , it won't make it 2 .. and i doubt my next tv will be a samsung ..  
1	  Fortunately , this product is " currently unavailable . " Should it ever become available again , do yourself a favor : avoid it . It looks like it might be a decent little iPod player that one could fold up and carry from home to work to vacation spots or whatever . If you were able to listen to it before buying it , you 'd realize that it 's just not good enough quality for any of these purposes . Tinny , weak sound . Way , way overpriced . Too bad I had to choose even a single star to rate it .  
1	  Unfortunately , the software for this item is not compatible with a Mac operating system as is suggested in the product description . I spoke with the manufacturer today , and while you can plug the WS-100 into a Mac you can't upload or download voice files or other data . Obviously , I can't evaluate its performance because it 's not compatible with my computer .  
1	  I received one of these as a birthday present from my sister ( a couple years ago ) and it 's proven to be a waste of my time and my sister 's money . The warranty was no help at all , as the nature of any warranty is a guarantee that the company will help with problems , not a guarantee that the company will actually solve the problems . The tech support consisted primarily of these two ideas : 1 . Charge the battery , and 2 . Reformat the hard drive . Sadly , neither worked . The product worked for at most a few minutes at a time before freezing up or some other such problem . Most of the time , turning the unit off and then on again did not help . The mp3 player always had problems , no matter what tech support suggested I do ( repeatedly ) . They provided support during the product 's warranty period , and then the warranty expired and I was left with a product that still didn't work . They refuse to take it back and provide a refund . The fact that this product is bulky and slow ( USB1.1 ) wouldn't bother me if it was a bulky and slow 10GB mp3 player . What makes me feel lied to is the fact that this product is a bulky , $ 250 paperweight .  
1	  I used it once and found the card to be defective . Some of the pictures i put on the card were Ok but others when I tried to touch them up and resave the picture , the computer said there were errors with the card . I tried to format the card several times but without seccess . I tossed it in the drawer with the other junk I have . TIM  
2	  This lens is wonderful ! It is easy to use and focuses beautifully . I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in good macro and portrait photography .  
2	  After getting the Philips HDR612 TiVo our TV viewing experience has changed for the better ! It is very easy to pick your favorite shows and have Tivo automatically record them . The previous reviewer who had trouble scheduling a recording must have been a Microsoft plant . The TiVo has a very simple and easy to use interface . We absolutely love it . Everyone I show it to ends up buying one .  
2	  Will it illuminate a bridge a hundred yards away ? Nope . Will it rotate in any direction so you can bounce flash off the ceiling when you are doing " fashion " angled pictures ? Nah-uh . Can you shoot continuous shots with the flash keeping up as fast as your memory card ? No way . It 's not a $ 900 professional flash . But the performance it gives for the price is extraordinary . Really , the only things I would add are the ability to use rechargeables that would charge in-unit ( i.e. charge the cameras , charge the flash ) ; the ability to run off the camera 's power if the battery is dead ( but that might be a limitation of the camera that precludes such a feature ) ; and the ability to at least rotate 90 degrees so you could bounce when taking a picture in the portrait position ( you can of course bounce off a wall , but the results are , well , unpredictable ) . Results out to 15 feet are outstanding , out to 30 feet not bad , and its integration with Nikon DSLR 's logic is incredible . I remember the Canon AE-1 ( dating myself here ) , the world 's first " automatic " camera with TTL metering , and how exciting it was when " automatic " flashes appeared as accessories . Well , " semi-automatic , " as they still required dialing in numbers . I don't know how , but between the Nikon and this flash , they figure everything out together . You set your desired brightness as if you were dialing in an index number ( assuming you want to even bother doing that much ) , the duo figure out how far away the target is , and adjusts everything accordingly . The instructions warn that they don't promise consistent results when bouncing - and you will bounce , that 's the whole point of such a flash ( no more red-eye , ever ! ) - but to be honest we 've had nothing but excellent results even bouncing off high ceilings . The unit even powers down when you turn off the camera so you don't waste batteries . You won't do continuous shooting but you 'll get a shot every five seconds or better with fresh batteries . One thing I was concerned about was lens shadow - we have the zoom autostabilizing lens and it causes a shadow when using the the pop-up flash at all but one zoom level . Not a problem at all . If you use the autostabilizer or one of the longer focal length zooms with a lens hood then you might have issues . Of course , if you 're bouncing , then by definition the problem goes away . One last beef , which is not a limitation of the flash but rather then D40 camera , is that the camera 's software does not check if an external flash is attached when you hit the popup button , so it is possible to deploy the popup which then smacks into the external . I 'm not sure what happens if you were to try to take a picture with both flashes up and on - it would be great if they actually all synched together , but since the D40 pop-up is not able to fully deploy with this flash sitting on top , I seriously doubt it .  
2	  I 've taken it on several climbing trips and traveled with it .. once you figure out the buttons its fantastic . I haven't had any issues anyone else is talking about ..  
2	  I purchased this product so I could take my laptop anywhere in the house and porch and use the internet . I do business on the internet and watch movies from Netflix . So far this product has performed well . The initial set up was fairly straight forward , as much as things can be with Charter cable internet , I was up and running in less than 30 minutes . I would recommend this product and have to friends .  
2	  I just want to add that I purchased this Polaroid TV over 5 years ago . I researched extensively before purchasing . I 'm glad that I haven't needed Cust Support . I have run this TV almost 24/7 for 5 + years with little problem . The HDMI works great and so does the composite input ( COAX ) . The sound sucks but I knew that when I bought it . Surround sound solves that issue . Every once in a while it looses it 's mind ( about every 6 months ) I turn off , unplug and wait 10 minutes . Everything resets itself and good to go for another 6 months . I 've repaired the remote about 6 times once because I dropped it in a saltwater fish tank . It is now taped but works fine . I guess I got a lucky set . I 'm happy with the picture quality . I 've used a Mitsubishi code for programming universal remotes . What else can I say the set has given me good service . Hope this helps someone . Tags are wrong , it is 720p NOT 1080i or 1080p  
1	  I have yet to install this item . Will get back to you as soon as I do  
1	  Good cable , no interference for 25 ' ! BUT the right channel doesn't work after 1 week . So NO don't buy , spend money on a bit better cable .  
2	  I bought this because my Netgear router wasn't working . The only problem I 've had is that I can't access the printer on our network and Linksys customer support sucks . They told me they were transferring me to get help but actually transferred me to a third party CS that wanted me to pay about $ 25 for tech support . But , that one issue aside , I have not had any problems with this router . I work from home and I count on my internet and this has been very reliable . I also have it connected to my Insignia Blue-ray player and it works great ! When I had my Netgear hooked up , it would take forever to connect to Netflix if at all and I was getting timed out on my internet connection . I would definitely recommend this router for a wired home network especially if you are wanting to use Netflix .  
1	  poor resolution , blurry and as a bonus : the picture gets worse over time . infrared lights on the camera are good for 3 feet .  
1	  After a couple of days the cartridge stopped working . I 'm going to order an official one from Samsung . This is the second time that a " compatible " toner cartridge failed . Thank goodness for Amazon 's great return policy .  
1	  THis must be a mistake .. this is priced $ 170.00 over the $ 29.95 , full retail price direct from KODAK !  
1	  It says that it 's USB 2.0 and confirmed by a sticker on it which says the same , haha . However when I plug it into my macbook pro with an ipod it tells me " The ipod is connected to a low-speed USB 1.1 port . For better performance you should connect it to a high-speed USB 2.0 port , .. " Also , if I go to the system profiler , my old 2.0 hub has this information : speed up to 480 Mb / sec . This hub says : Up to 12 Mb / sec . I think we can be certain that this is a USB 1.1 hub - Now I 'm wondering how I can get my $ back -  
2	  I 've been using these cables for about a month now , and they deliver audio and video equal to the other cables I bought that cost much , much more . Using them for the cable box and PS3 and I 've got nothing to complain about . Didn't seem as robust in build quality when I first saw them , but that was an eyebrow raiser more than a complaint , because after handling them I see no noticeable difference . They 're not stiff or brittle at all . Great buy !  
2	  I have priced this particular item in other places and it was way more expensive . I needed to upgrade the amount of RAM in my desktop pc and this was exactly what I was looking for . I installed this in my PC as soon as it arrived . I have not had any problems .  
1	  Well , they fit , but they don't click in like the originals did so they are loose in the holder . Looking at them I can't see the difference but these just don't lock in .  
1	  Audio CDs do not play in most CD players . This burner is a total piece of junk for making audio CDs . Stay away .  
1	  This unit has great sound and quite a punch . 22 Watt RMS , twin possition BBE processing for nice mids . But the biggest drawback is the quality of the unit itself . First off , the magic flap idea is unique . But the first problem I had is that it wouldn't always flip open for use , but continue to play . Next , All of a sudden all it would do is play the disc , and never even eject . I was stuck listening to the same disc for a couple of days . Then it just quit working all together . When I contacted Aiwa , They informed me that I was just days past the end of my warranty . It would therfore cost me 99.00 to get it fixed . End of story . This unit is either going in the trash , or I am going to send back to the manufacturer so they can shove it where they may . I will never buy another product from this company . And I would advise anyone I know to do the same . If you ask me , they don't deserve anyone 's money .  
1	  This is one of the worst gadgets ( if you could call it that ) I have ever bought in my life . It is totally useless . Yes , I could scan , but I have spent 5 hours trying to get it to communicate with my computer . The program does not even attempt to communicate . I am now sending it back . You would be better off throwing your money out of the window . At least someone could pick it up and use it for something worthwhile .  
2	  I bought this cap for my NIKON D40 and it fit like a glove , was a purchase i needed for a very long time . Im glad I found it here on Amazon at a great price .  
1	  Ok . I don't know how you guys are doing it . I assembled the telescope ok with the supplied directions . I attempted to align the sighting scope with the mirror . It was way off and very difficult to adjust . It is so unhelpful that the spotting scope shows a world upside down and backwards . It constantly makes you move the telescope the wrong way to find what you are looking for . I also had difficulty with the up-down ( latitude ) adjustment . Why are there two locks for that ? If one is locked up you can't move the other one . Not user friendly for fine tuning . Not intuitive to me . I had no success finding a single object in the main viewer . I wasn't trying to use the magnifying eyepiece . If the spotting scope is no good and the eyepieces are no good , why have this thing ? OK , I am frustrated at the moment and will try again tomorrow . Other people have had better results so I will assume I just need more practice . I will change and delete this post if I figure it out . BTW , I have no telescope experience but have read scores of books on astronomy and I know , sort of , where good stuff is and what it is . I found the Andromeda galaxy easily in binoculars , but couldn't even get the scope on the Orion nebula , seeing all the stars around it with the naked eye easily . Later : Well , I have managed to find the moon and the Orion nebula . The spotting scope keeps getting bumped out of position so it is necessary to aim the whole telescope . With total manual controls , it is most difficult to find an object even if you are very close to it . But practice is helping . I don't have especially dark skies , so the potential of my viewing is unknown . The moon looked pretty good . With the Orion nebula , I could resolve only 2 of the 4 central Trapezium stars , but some nebulosity was visable . It looks nothing like long exposures from a big mirror under dark skies , but better than my big binoculars and much harder to find .  
2	  This capacitor does what it was designed to do . My headlights no longer dim .. It also has some cool blue lights on the top . Great capacitor for the cost !  
2	  I am a country and western fan in Memphis . This new Sony product is great ! I meam really great . I don't have to remember songs I hear on the radio anymore . Definitely worth the $ 19.99 I paid . Get one !  
1	  The plan came as promised , but the item that it covers is listed nowhere on the contract . If I needed to replace the item , would the contract cover it ?  
2	  Im not an electronics whiz at the least . Friend suggested this for a low cost dependable power supply to go with new video card , I installed both myself ! which is amazing .. Very simple does its job pushing new video card , 0 problems so far since purchase in june / 09  
1	  I would have given this piece of junk 0 stars but that seems to be impossible . It collapsed while I was fixing a TV and I landed flat on my back . ( Only my bad reflexes kept me from hanging on to the TV and have it fall on me ) . For a device rated at over 300 lbs this piece of equipment is truly GARBAGE . My wife , present when I took my fall , wanted me to sue the daylights out of the manufacturer but I am not the suing type and my mid back is beginning to feel better . DO NOT BUY THIS !  
1	  Fit 's perfectly , protects well ( including screen ) , will NEVER fall out .. but : It attracts every particle possible . Dust , hair , cathair , furnature fabrics & everything else will coat the case . On the bright side , I paid about $ 1.50 for mine with free shipping , so it 's a nice back-up to my Griffin leather snap-on case .  
2	  Remote sending of video + audio + IR control is a good idea planned to be delivered by this artifact . Truth is interference degrades audio and renders video unusable from just 25 feet and one through-wall . Think twice before taking this solution because as 2.4 GHz band is crowded , 5.8 represents hope but performance is subject to a myriad of conditions .  
2	  This item is perfect for my Panasonic DMC-TZ1k . I 'm really glad to be purchasing this item .  
1	  Bought this to go with my Zire 31 . The case fits well - although the cover itself is just a flap - no closure . For carrying around in an outside pocket on my purse its ok . If it were just another piece of floatsam in my suitcase of a purse , I can't imagine it would do much good . Its a little difficult to get the stylus out of the back when the Zire is in the case , but not impossible . The stylus is cool - a blackpen , an orange pen , a pencil and stylus all in one . It took me a few minutes to figure out exactly how to switch from one to another - but I managed . The screen protectors are ok - nothing spectacular . Don't follow the lines printed on the screen cover when you trim them to fit your PDA - the lines for my Zire 31 are a bit small . All in all , this is ok - but I think next time I will try to find a better case . I would advise any PDA noobs to buy the PDA , take it with you to a store that sells cases and pick one out from there .  
1	  The product cannot be setup following the steps shown in the setup CD . I do find it very frustrating as i am not located in US and even calling up the toll-free technical support is not an option for me . Still struggling to get the router setup !  
2	  This device saved me from buying another HD satellite receiver for my bedroom HD tv upstairs . On receiving the package I first of all put one of the batteries on charge for 16 hours in the UFO 's charger . After that I replaced it with one of the batteries in my sat receiver 's remote control . Then I placed the ' UFO ' near my sat receiver in my living room downstairs , attached the emitter to the sat receiver 's sensor , and I remote contolled my second floor bedroom tv very easily as if I was infront of my sat receiver downstairs . The signal passed through stone walls and concrete ceiling with amazing ease . The selector switch in the ufo 's battery charger compartment was set to A ( 56khz ) and I did not even had to erect the UFO 's telescopic antenna . I put the spare rechargeable battery on charge in the ufo 's compartment , so that many weeks later I 'll find it readily available for replacement when the other one in the remote control goes dead . The remote worked perfectly even from under the blankets , so useful on cold nights . A really amazing device I never expected to work so good . Set up is child 's play . I recommend it to all concerned . By the way , I connected my bedroom tv from my sat receiver downstairs , using a two way HDMI splitter and a 20 feet HDMI cable which I also bought from Amazon . And deliveries are so fast . Congratulations . One little disadvantage though is the power supply adapter which is included and which has an input of 120V . There should be a choice of power supplies because many countries like mine have a main supply of 230V . So I had to discard the one they sent me and incur an extra expence buying a suitable adapter with a 230V input and a 12V output . I think the manufacturing company should easily correct this inconvenience for their customers .  
1	  I love everything about this camera BUT .. The display is very touchy . I only owned the camera for 2 months and my display broke . I had it in a case and must have bumped it just right . My display shattered . Mind you there is not a view finder so you can only guess what you are taking pictures of . This is NOT covered under your warranty . My camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet . So I am sitting here with no camera , which is really bothersome since I Love taking pictures . I figured I would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen ! So I highly recommend this camera but you MUST be VERY VERY careful with it !  
1	  The 580EX II is prone to failure . With minimal use , mine failed in less than a year . At first it occasionally misfired , giving blank black pictures . Cleaning the contacts and sliding it on and off the camera seemed to help at first . Now it is just plain dead . I 've missed numerous photo opportunities forever . Search the web and you 'll find many forums devoted to the various ways this flash can die . Most disappointing is the short warranty . Canon gave me a repair estimate of $ 180 . I paid $ 450 for the flash unit 10 months ago . This is not right . Other info : The flash was used exclusively on a Canon Eos 7D camera . Used for approximately 1,000 flash photos . With a total cost of $ 630 for the 580EX II , that comes to $ . 63 per flash actuation . Not exactly a fun way to enjoy my photography hobby .  
2	  I received these headphones a few weeks ago now . I have been using them with my PC at work ( the primary purpose I bought them for ) , with my iPod Shuffle and on a plane with the iPod and also just to reduce the noise from the plane 's engine . I am not an audiophile , but these sound great ! I had a comparable model of over-the-ear Philips headphones about 10 years ago that lasted a long time and also sounded great , and was very fond of . I got these because I wanted something similar again . At about $ 30 these are really inexpensive and great value for the money . I read a lot of reviews before settling on this particular pair . I was forewarned not to expect too much from the noise canceling feature . Those reviews were right . Although there is a slight reduction in the noise level once the noise cancellation is enabled it is nothing you cannot do without . Nevertheless , its nice to have . They reduced noise sufficiently to let me sleep on the plane .  
2	  I bought this for my husband for Christmas along with an auto trash holder and it is being used every day .. it 's definitely worth the money !  
2	  especially for this price , forget those $ cable . and it arrived just day before my TV got here .  
1	  I received my battery pack on time , but unfortunately I only used my battery pack for two weeks and then it suddenly failed . I don't know the reason ; I supposed the battery pack was compatible with the Sony PEG NZ 90 . Now the battery pack is death  
1	  Logitech Keyboard IssueOn 22-Nov-2004 I called Logitech at 1-702-269-3457 to arrange for an RMA . They said no need to return the broken unit , they would send a replacement keyboard out within 24-48 hours . They assigned Case # XX and RMA # XX . On 29-Nov-2004 spoke to a nice person ( name witheld ) who was pleasant and polite . I told her that the good news was that I just received the replacement keyboard , the bad news is that it is the wrong one . It is a " Media " model which is a lower model than the " Elite " that I purchased . I pointed out that this model is missing 2 key features , the thumb wheel on the left and the volume dial on the top ; the 2 main reasons for which I bought the Elite model . She put me on hold and when she came back , she proceeded to try to convince me that the model they sent me was an " upgrade " from the " Elite " . I explained to her that her assertion was incorrect and the " Media " model was clearly an inferior model . I pointed out that on Newegg . com , the " Media " sells for $ 18 while the " Elite " sells for $ 29 . I again pointed out that this model is missing 2 key features , the thumb wheel on the left and the volume dial on the top ; the 2 main reasons for which I bought the Elite model . She put me on hold several times during the call which , by the way , lasted for 55 minutes . Each time she came back she continued to try to sell the idea that I was getting an upgrade . I was patient for the first 50 minutes of this but I 'm not a saint and finally stopped her . I told her that I was an Engineer , a very technical and computer savvy person and that no one , any where would consider what they did an upgrade . I told her that I didn't appreciate being treated this way . And requested to speak to a supervisor . At that point , she admitted that the " Media " model was missing features and that she understood my concerns . She then said that they had no more " Elite " models and that 's why they sent the " Media " model . I suggested they get one from one of their vendors like Newegg . com ; she said I WOULD HAVE TO BUY IT FROM THEM DIRECTLY and they had no way of compensating me for that . She then said that the " Elites " were no longer being manufactured . What should I believe here ? So in the end , they did not comply with the terms of their own warranty . When I pointed that out , she said that they did by sending me the inferior keyboard . How ridiculous is this ! I was appalled ! If it didn't happed to me , I would have doubted that it really happened . Finally , I asked if she was going to comply with my earlier request to speak to a supervisor . She said yes and went on hold yet again .. she came back and we waited for another 5 or so minutes for the supervisor ( Todd ) who never answered . She then asked if she could have him call me back in a few minutes and confirmed my phone number . What nonsense ! I have never seen a company tell such bold falsehoods to avoid fulfilling its warranty commitments , especially considering that this was all for a lousy $ 30 product . Wouldn't it have been easier to just make the customer happy and handle this ? They won the battle , but I 'll win the war by never buying another Logitech product again and I urge all of you who read this sad tale to also avoid buying from them . The supervisor NEVER CALLED . Run , don't walk away from these guys .  
1	  Well I was somewhat enjoying the tuner until I plugged it in one day and it started shooting out sparks and smoking . But even when it wasn't catching on fire the quality was not great and it was way too bulky . It worked less than 2 months .  
2	  I have 2 of these now and will be getting about 3 more the ease of handling and the secured holding of the disc as well as capacity makes this an ideal case for our massive collection  
1	  HELLO BOUGHT THIS INVERTER SPECIFICALLY TO POWER THE 180 WATT BATTERY CHARGER THAT I USE TO POWER UP THE BATTERIES ON MY ELECTRIC MOTORCYCLE . VERY DISAPPOINTING . IT IS A 900 WATT UNIT AND WHILE IT WOULD POWER OTHER 110 VOLT APPLIANCES , IT WOULD NOT RUN THE MUCH SMALLER DRAW THAT IS REQUIRED FOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED CHARGER . ONCE THE CHARGER WAS PLUGGED INTO THIS INVERTER , THIS INVERTER WOULD START BEEPING EVERY ATTEMPT . FUTHER , I EMAILED THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THIS UNIT 2 WEEKS AGO AND I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM.I BUILT MY OWM SOLAR PANELS , AND THEY WORK FINE . I PUT TOGETHER SOME 12 VOLT BATTERIES POSITIVE POSITIVE TO POSITIVE ETC . MY GOAL WAS TO HAVE ONE SOLAR POWERED RIDE ON MY MOTORCYCLE THIS FALL BEFORE IT WAS TIME TO PUT IT AWAY . THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.I DID MY PART , BUT WAS LET DOWN BY THIS PRODUCT . END OF REVIEWRodney7777  
2	  These cards are worth it if you can get them under the retail price to save a bit of cash and so you don't have to use your Credit Card on Xbox live .  
2	  I bought two of these straps . One for our D-SLR camera and one for our full size 10X50 binoculars . The strap works very well for both of these applications . The only complaint is that it could be a bit wider . There was an error made in the shipping cost . Shipping cost were applied to each strap even though they shipped in the same package . We called this error to Op / Tech 's attention and it was resolved immediately . I would buy this item again .  
2	  I bought the web cam just to try it and see how it worked . It does more than I thought it would . I just wanted a way to keep an eye on my cabin while I 'm not there . To look in and make sure everything is ok , etc . The camera works great , and the free web site I can go to to see the cam from anywhere is cool . I didn't realize it had several modes though , but along with live video , you can also set 4 different timers , to either take a still at pre-set times , or to use a motion detector . If you use the timer , and set it for like once a day , you can then go into buffered images and push the " play " button , and it 's like time laspse photography , which is very cool . I bought this as a gift for my wife , and she truely loves it , which is a bonus in itself .  
1	  Do NOT buy this router if you are an NTL subscriber in the UK . The parental control requires direct access to the router to set the parental control and this is not possible because NTL uses hidden proxies . What will happen is that your web access will be intermittent and you will be frequently asked by the router to set your parental control settings . Of course , whether you chose to disable or enable , the update will fail . Belkin 's answer to this , is that you should take the router and plug it in to another ISP connection . They failed to answer the questions 1 ) will this parental control problem appear again when the firmware is updated , or 2 ) when the router is restored to factory defaults or 3 ) when the router is disconnected from the power for a reasonable time . I have asked for a refund of money and I will buy something else - but definitely not a Belkin .  
2	  I got the Antec Notebook Cooler to replace my old Targus Coolpad . The Antec is lightweight and durable , the faceplate is made up of aluminum which helps in the heat dissipation , while other chill pads are made of plastic . It is silent and really works well . The Antec allows you to control the speed of the fan ( high or low ) . I especially like the way you can store the USB cable in the little storage compartment . It does what its meant to do . I highly recommend this product .  
1	  This is a good remote , but it keeps jumping in price . I payed $ 10 less for one just a few months ago . Before that we bought two for even less . It 's not like they 're making the remote better , just more expensive . This remote is worth $ 25 at most , NOT the $ 58 they currently have it marked at . The only reason I payed $ 48 is it 's the one that matched the other remotes my boyfriend bought . He was astonished when he found out I payed double ( at Amazon . com ) . Find another , more reasonably priced choice . I did . UPDATE : So after purchasing two of these remotes , in less than I year I have replaced them both . Why ? They stop working correctly . The first one double and triple hits the buttons and is now impossible to use ( even after an attempt to clear the entire remote and start from scratch ) . For example , if you try to put in channel " 03 " you 're more likely to get channel " 00333 " . Try to move the channel up or down by one ? No , try two or three . The math on that turns into card counting after a bit . Now the 2nd one ( which is much newer ) started showing the same sign of " uncontrolled " clicking , and worse yet , simply " loosing " commands ( don't ask me how , I have no idea ) . So yes , it will work amazingly well , until it doesn't . Personally , I 've been trying the " One For All " brands , and finding them quite compatible with the satellite tv remotes and the blue-ray players ( which this remote isn't so much ) .  
1	  This unit has more glitches than you can imagine , and liteon knows it and will not fix the problems . We spent an hour with tech support until the support person finally admitted it was a bad machine and she couldn't help us . Buy a panasonic . Ours works great . I will never buy a liteon product ever again . They just don't care about their customers .  
1	  It has been 6 weeks and I have still not received the camera they sent a smart media card instead . I have tried several times to have it picked up .  
1	  I bought these for over $ 100 from the apple store , but they lasted barely three months before one side went out . They look good and are stylishly designed and come with the remote answer / hangup button just like the original iphone headset . The sound was average . Quite acceptable , but not as good as my Shure e2c in-ear phones . Definitely recommned looking elsewhere if you 're going to subject these to anything but the gentlest usage .  
2	  This is the third Logan Slide File that I have ordered . Good product for the purpose for which it was designed .  
2	  Hi , I lost my camera battery charger and what good is a good camera without a charger . I searched online and quickly found one on amazon . com . It was delivered to me within a few days and is an exact duplicate of the one I lost . I am very please with the service and quality . Thanks .. SuzanneOlympus LI-10C Battery Charger for Select Stylus and C series Digital Cameras  
1	  This product was a big disappointment . The previous reviews showed a mixed history in install problems . I tried it anyway because I had seen it operate in a friend 's vehicle - and it operated great . I charged the system , as required , for two hours . My install failed - after the software recommended an update from the latest version available via the web to replace the default install from the CD . All attempts to recover or re-install from here on failed . Whenever the Tom-Tom was turned on and connected to my computer it locked up the system . When I turn Tom-Tom off , everything was fine . The manual reset had not change in this behavior . Attempts to re-install the software had no effect this . The web-page I was directed to by the install disk apologized that the manual was not currently available . The 1-800 phone number did not get through . At that point I lost confidence in this company and returned the product to Amazon .  
2	  this thing is really cool you otta get it its awesome it ha games and you can download even more games and it helps with organizaton and its AWESOME  
2	  I bought this after my first purchase ( not amazon . com ) was a DOA ; and I am glad that it was . This KVM switch works just like it says on the website . One of the machines need to use a USB port - one for both Kb and mouse , which gives you more options . The switch also allows you to " split " the sound output ( and mic ) which is a very useful feature . The first few runs my mouse seemed fickle , but somehow it fixed itself , could have been just my mouse . The hotkeys work great , and the physical switch is a good attribute as well . I thouroughly recommend this product - for me it was truely a complete Plug and Play ! P.S. I am running linux FC4 on one of the machines and it works like a charm .  
2	  I am using this to feed video to an LCD projector . I was afraid that the picture quality would suffer , but no worries . It looks great . Vibrant colors and no noise . I am not using the audio , so I cannot comment on that . One complaint , though . If you are in the habit of using premium cables you 're out of luck here . The plastic molding on the external case of these units is so close to the outside of the RCA jacks that there is no room for the thicker connectors found on high-end cables . The unit comes with two video / audio cables of the standard variety , and they fit fine . I wish I could use premium cables .  
1	  A friend of mine gave me this cam as a gift and as soon as i took one picture . I got the infamous battery depleted error popping up . I recommend anyone considering to buy this cam google pentax optio s40 battery depleted . So far there is no fix . They should do a recall and the sellers up here should quit trying sell it to pple that are not aware of the malfunction it has . O well in the garbage it gos .  
2	  I Aboslutely love this DVD player ! I bought it for $ 119 and it was worth every penny . I bought this one because it was inexspensive , but it turned out to be much higher quality than you would expect . The Screen is large and bright , with controls for brightness , contrast , hue , saturation . It plays any kind of disc you can think of . The remote is nice too , its very small . The motor is very quiet , you can barely hear the sound of the disc spinning . I also Like the two headphone jacks . My nephew and I can watch a movie in the car , and both can listen to it . Also If you want headphones and the other person wants to listen through the speakers , you can plug headphones in jack 2 and it will play through the 1 pair of headphones and the speakers . The adapter that it comes with lets you plug a TV soource IN or OUT of the DVD player . So u can use it as a TV for your Satellite receiver , or use it as a DVD player for a larger TV . My home DVD player recently broke , so I have been using this as my home DVD player since . I have had one single problem with this . One day in July I was watching a movie and the disc stopped spinning and wouldn't play . I called Insignia , and they helped me every step of the way . They told me to open it up , cut off the lens cover , ( im just kidding ! ) I called them and talked to them for 6 minutes and solved the problem . It was condenstation on the lens from our central air conditioning . I let it sit outside for 30 minutes and the water on the lens all dryed up and the DVD player was working again ! This is a quality DVD player that I would reccomend to anybody .  
1	  I purchased this item from a local retail store ( the only brand they had on the shelf ) and I was disappointed to find it makes an audible " Clack Clack " noise , due to plastic parts rattling around during operation . I used it for several months until it eventually got a short in the wire , just above the headphone jack , under minimal wear and tear . Obviously I don't recommend this item , and I would advise against getting most white electronics for your car because they turn noticeably yellow in the sun .  
2	  I Love this camera ! It works so good and is so much fun ! Came exactly the day it said ! Very fast !  
1	  This product was received in relatively decent packaging . When I opened the package , the bulb / resistor was not included . The manual stated that the resistor was supplied , so I was very disappointed in the fact that parts were missing . I tried to install this piece in my 02 Volkswagen Passat GLS , but I had to buy some random 5 volt bulbs from O'reillys in order to charge the capacitor . It successfully charged on the third attempt , but it immediately let off all the energy . I tried to charge the capacitor several times after this , but it would not charge . After spending several hours on this small project , I gave up and the cap is now sitting in my basement . I do believe the cap would 've been worth it , but the missing part was very disappointing and it may have been the reason that it could not be used . I would recommend investing your money on a company that would get things right the first time , such as Rockford Fosgate . It may cost a little more , but the results are completely worth the extra cash .  
1	  Wanna know why this product is so cheap ? Because it won't work in a couple of months . I just went to watch a movie , and the picture is in black and white ONLY . NO COLOR . I called Apex , and they agreed that it was defective , and now want ME to pay the shipping + handling , in order to send it to them . Apex is going in the trash can , and now I 'm off to buy a REAL player .  
2	  This bag fits everything I could possibly want to put in it . It 's also very well made . I recommend to anyone who travels somewhat light and has a laptop . 2 thumbs up .  
1	  I just received my Linksys wireless router today . The Set Up Wizard CD will not play on my eepc running Ubuntu 9.10 and Puppee Linux . I found some written instructions on the web and a few youtube videos . I followed them to a T and nothing works . I get no hardwire etho connection , I get no wlan connection . The product page for this router clearly states that it is Linux compatible . Not so if the set up CD won't even play . A waste of my money and time .  
1	  This camera is way less then i expect . colors are dull , and recording feature soundslike a tin can . it may not be the most expensivecamera out there but i expected more for the cost .  
1	  The iTrip just doesn't work in the New York , Northern NJ area . I tried all the recommended stations , but the sound quality is not even remotely acceptable . There is considerable static . Just terrible .  
1	  It is not Windows XP compatible until after you contact customer service ! The device driver that came with mine was created 01/05/2001 . ( I purchased it 06/14/2005 ) When you try to install the driver it insists that it has to have Window ME or 98 to work and then shuts down due to a " Serious Error " . Customer Service wanted to help me correct lines of programming , I opted to take it back to the store and get my money back rather than fix their mistakes and help them get rid of an outdated product .  
2	  Easy to use , protects your ipod perfectly , and the screen is still very clear . Only problem , cant plug it in on normal travel speakers without taking the ipod out of its case , which is not the easiest thing to put back on . If you can devote one minute extra for this , you will love it .  
1	  Got these for CA$50 . First impression : poor material and build quality for a Sennheiser . The headband is a cheap-looking , poorly molded plastic piece , got rather sharp material leftovers along edges . Had to arm myself with a pen knife and spent half an hour removing and smoothing those . The speakers don't hold in place well , so frequent re-adjusting is needed . Sound quality is ok , nothing extraordinary , rather flat and dry ; I get a better response from my old $ 20 Radioshack pieces . Cord length ( some 10 ft ) is a plus , but there is no volume control on the cord . To sum up : cheap headphones from a reputable manufacturer . Want to flash the Sennheiser logo - go and buy these , otherwise I guess you can get a better bang for $ 50 .  
2	  Great sound . The front of the speaker as far as a rock design cou ; d have more detail like a rock so the speaker is not somewhat in apperance but the performance as far as the sound and being a larger rock is great . I did not realize that one rock is set for right and left balance so I used one wire hook up because I wanted two large rocks in the landscape to have a better sound by distance between the speakers . Thanks .  
1	  I just opened the box to discover that the S2-E2 does NOT come with Batteries included . This is so disappointing , after waiting so long for the package to arrive , I wanted to test the new toy but now I have to start searching for the battery . This was never made clear on the Amazon website or by the seller that the batteries are not included other wise I would have bought the batteries at the time I bought the ST-E2 . I am sure this item is going to work great but this is a huge deal for me and I wanted to make this clear for others who are buying this item . I Hope people would like to see why someone gave it a single star . I will write a review about the functionality later , once I get a hold on the battery and able to use it .  
2	  These are a good purchase for the price , will serve you well on a long international flight . Have traveled to South America , Europe , India and China with these and was very thankful . However if you 're thinking to use these for a noisy subway commute or to study quietly in Starbucks , they won't cut it . Just keep your expectations realistic for the price and you 'll be satisfied .  
1	  I have also experienced the noise and very slow speed others have mentioned . Additionally , the product has prematurely failed . Turning off PCast did silence the clicking noise , but this forced me to use another drive for my shared iTunes library . To its credit , the drive was able to stream HDTV ( a recorded transport stream of about 10GB per hour ) , but for general file copying , this drive is very , very s l o w . My main complaint with this product is the fact that it completely FAILED less than 2 years after purchase . I had thought I was extending the life of the product by turning off PCast ( constant read / write ) but to no avail . The LED now blinks 6 times , indicating irreparable disk failure , emits a painful groaning noise , and will not connect to any computer . I have also experienced the same , slow , nearly useless advice from the customer " service " personnel . Forget about ever reaching them by phone - their M.O. is a delayed , cryptic e-mail if anything at all . I will never buy another Buffalo product . I bought this product because technically it looked good on paper - in spite of its ugly enclosure design . But while the company may have some good ideas , their execution is pitiful .  
1	  Normally , the Disney Company only partners with superior companies to produce goods bearing the Disney name or likeness . This is not one of those instances . We purchased the Princess 13 " TV for our girls for Christmas . The in-laws bought the DVD player . We used the DVD player for less then one week , and it stopped working . I checked the owner 's manual , and there was no mention of the infamous question mark that appeared in the upper right hand corner of the screen . I called MEMOREX , who made this DVD player , and after being on hold for nearly 30 minutes , was told that the progressive scan switch must be on , and to shut it off . I told the agent that I didn't think this DVD player had progressive scan , to which I was told " All of our DVD players have a progressive scan switch " . When I got home , I checked , and of course , she was WRONG ! I called again and was told I could either take it back where it was purchased from , or send it to them . I brought it to Sears , and exchanged it . So far ( knock on wood ) , the new one is working fine . It is really cute , and my kids love it . I am just waiting for it to crap out again though . SAVE THE BOX IF YOU BUY THIS ! CHANCES ARE , YOU 'LL NEED IT FOR A RETURN ! The TV is great , and works fine !  
2	  This is a good deal for people who want a pair of binoculars and a camera . You can take both of these things almost anywhere . You can take it to a ball game and get a good veiw and take a couple of pictures and the color of these thing are pretty cool too .  
2	  I am involved in amateur astrophotography these days and now I don't have to worry about my batteries dying when I 'm in the middle of a long session of 3-4 hours . This adapter works perfectly with my Canon Digital Rebel XT ( 350D ) and is the " one to buy " for this purpose . It comes with two fake batteries ( one for the PowerShot G7 I suppose and one for the Rebel XT / XTi ) and a little mini jack plugs into that after it is inserted into the camera . As always , Canon quality is apparent . This product is a great value .  
2	  I bought this mouse about six months ago and I still think its the best mouse I 've ever seen . The wireless works up to even 6ft away from the transmiter . It works better by putting the mouse and the transmiter in one level . The scroll is excellent ( Right , left , top , and bottom . ) I can't tell anything about the battary life because I 'm using rechargable battaries . I think it would be still good to use regular battaries . The extra bottoms are usefull . You can change the functions . If you want to use them you have to install a software for it but if you don't its plug and play . I 'm happy with my purchase .  
2	  Since the new iPhone 5 no longer uses the same charging pin as the previous models I needed a way to charge my new phone while still being able to charge my old iPod and my girlfriends 4S in the car . This does it all and now I can charge both devices at the same time . Great cheap solution !  
1	  This item puts out bad sound quality . In my personal auto it is so-so but in my van at work it is horrible . So forget about it .  
2	  Product is great , but supplier is a cheat . Charged $ 5.40 each for 4 headphone sets but then added $ 23.90 S + H making order total $ 45.86even though supplier stated they charge only $ 2.50 per order which means the total should have been $ 24.46 . Good luck trying emailing supplier to get resolution . Good luck .  
1	  This product has a lifespan of about one week . Either the cartridges are only partially filled ( very small to begin with ) , or the ink solidifies when air hits it . Lousy deal .  
2	  I use this headset for online gaming communications . The pads on the earpieces are excellent providing great comfort and the quality is amazine both for the sound and mic . Must have , great price !  
1	  In the camera , the low battery light comes on right away even when freshly charged  
1	  I purchased this DVD player on recommendation from a salesman . What they failed to tell me is that LG is a new company that doesn't have all the kinks worked out in their product . I brought it home and hooked it up via HDMI . Everything looked great .. but then we noticed the audio was out of synch . It was like watching a bad Kung Fu movie that was dubbed .. ON EVERY SINGLE DVD . I contacted LG and they had to send me an update CD ( couldn't get it online ) . After running this update CD , it fixed the problem .. but now my DVD player thinks that it is in Spain ( NOT Region 1 ) and I can't play ANY Region 1 DVDs .. my entire DVD collection is now rendered useless . I called LG and they were absolutely NO HELP . I finally did some online research and downloaded a hack that removed the encoding from the DVD which allows me to play Region 1 DVDs .. but it reverts to the Spanish language track on 98 % of DVDs . It is very annoying that we have to go to the language menu before playing EVERY SINGLE DVD . And , to make matters worse , the unit now freezes often and has to be unplugged and restarted up to 10 times in order to play a DVD . This is a piece of junk that was never fully tested . You will waste time just getting it to work . Do yourself a favor and buy a Sony or Panasonic .  
2	  Ideal for off camera flash photography with light modifiers . This is a strobist essential . Though this model is a bit heavy .  
2	  This is the best cable value vs . price that i have found and it works perfectly . Also it IS 1080p capable .  
2	  I keep this on the side of my shower , so I will admit it has not gotten splashed much with water , but it seems to hold up well to the humidity . The sound is really impressive , loud and audible . Pretty easy to set up as well .  
1	  Had the i950 for about 10 months before major problems set in . First pictures took on a strange blueish hue . I replaced the ink cartridges for lots of money . It worked for a while then stopped . I stopped printing pics for about 3 months , then came back to it and the printer wouldn't budge . Totally gone . Canon support couldn't help . I also can a canon s400 camera . LCD screen went bad one day . I sent it in and canon told me I got water into the camera . I 'm anal about that and can tell you that water never got into the camera ! $ 100 to fix it . 6 months later the problem came back . Canon said it 's past their service guarantee , so it would have cost another $ 100 to fix it . I switched to Kodak EasyShare camera and printer and am totally happy now .  
2	  I learned that there were $ 3 HDMI cords for sale ( $ 0.01 and $ 2.99 S + H ) and I was a bit skeptical at first , but after I recieved both my cords ( Was such a good deal I bought another one an hour later , even though I doubted they would be any good ) any bit of skepticism was gone . I have not had a single problem with these cords , and use them to play my Xbox 360 and my PS3 on my 1080p tv constantly , beautiful and definitely got more than I expected ! Works as good as my $ 40 cord . *  
2	  This is the 2nd identical model I 've had , the first lasted in my home officefor many years with no problems . When I finally had to replace it , the choicewas a no brainer . Just as the original one I had , this is an excellantunit  
1	  Just resting my thumbs on the space bar causes repeated spaces to be typed . Seriously , I don't even have to press the space bar , just touch it , or breath on it . At first I thought my keyboard was possessed and I could barely type anything legible . I also have problems with letters and keys being repeated , even though my fingers are off the keyboard . The delete key has this behavior as well , which has caused me to inadvertently 5-10 emails until the delete button decides to unpress itself . I give up !  
2	  This is a replacement for my old thermos that broke when it dropped . This works great and holds the whole pot .  
1	  One week after I purchased this product it started to come apart . It is definitely NOT worth the money . I did not abuse it . I used it as anyone would normally use a mouse pad .  
2	  I 've had this camera for over 2 years now and it still takes beautiful pictures ! Easy to use and very durable , I dropped it a couple of times and NOTHING happened . I highly recommend this product .  
1	  What else can you say except they do exactly what they are supposed to do . However , they only last about one year before the suction cup rips away from the metal backup . I am now on number three . Unfortunately , there is no other option . How can Garmin make such a great GPS and such a sorry suction cup ?  
2	  My boyfriend is on 100 % travel and purchased the slingbox to keep at my house so he could keep up with his shows on tivo and watch East coast football games when he is working in CA . It works amazing ! He is considering buying another one just to hook up to a 400 disc DVD changer so his whole DVD library will be available no matter where he is in the world . Additionally , when he is gone we can also do dorked out things like watch Heroes together , me at home , him on his computer , that are actually really nice when you can't be with someone . Great picture , no lag time and super easy set up . Highly recommended .  
1	  It simply did not work . I tested it against a shorter cable ( the one I was trying to replace with this one ) , and the shorter cable worked . This one did not . Buy a cable with a company name on it , like Belkin etc . They 're more likely to be QA 'd properly , at least since the company 's brand would suffer if they failed to work . I would exchange this cable , but the equipment setup it was originally supposed to be used with was delayed in its implementation by several months . My seller has a 30-day return / exchange policy . Lesson : Verify functional integrity of all purchases upon receipt , even if they won't be used immediately . One final note : This product has much thinner contact strips on the interior of its B-plug ( the one that goes into the printer ) than the same strips on the interior of my working cable 's B-plug . Bad manufacturing ? You decide .  
2	  I bought this to allow me to use my mp3 with my car stereo and in order for it to put out enough signal you have to hold it . I know it is a small electronics thing but I wanted it to be safe , it 's bad enough that you cant plug it in to the car power but you have to hold it and the tuning wheel is very sensitive . Is good for in house though .  
1	  I bought this keyboard because of the split design ( better wrist angle ) , but the keys feel loose and a bit sluggish . They also have a surprising amount of resistance so that my hands get tired after a very short time and the space bar tends to stick in the " on " ( down ) position . The keys are also kind of large so I find myself reaching for the backspace key . For $ 80 , I expected better quality and ergonomics from Logitech . I really feel like , with more work , they could have a fantastic product . If they added a touchpad to the keyboard , it would be even better .  
2	  I have ordered miles of cables in the past year and this item hasn't been a disappointment at all . If you purchase this brand you won't have any issues at all . I 'm picky on what I use in my house and my project and this I 'd say is well worth it . 100 % good value and 100 % good quality .  
1	  Same functionality without the pretty colors : 100 ties for under $ 10 . Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping Cable Ties , 0.5 Inches x 8 Inches Long , Black , 100 Ties per Pack ( 91140 )  
2	  Works great . Hold My T3 Camera , a 75-300 Lens and has space to hold a third lens . Has shoulder strap , carrying handle and a fanny pack strap . Heavy quality nylon .  
2	  The remote is quite handy for low light and longer exposure shooting . Providing you have a tripod or you are able to keep the camera still , this remote is perfect . I was able to get great 4th of July shots and night scenes with the use of the remote .  
2	  The charger came within the time they said . I started using it right away and my daughter is happy with the product .  
2	  Es un cd de 5 estrellas . Excelente grabaci & oacute ; n , buen sonido , interpretaci & oacute ; n exquisita tanto en la m & uacute ; sica llamada cl & aacute ; sica , Albeniz , Bach , Rodrigo , Handel , Satie como en aquella de filmes como The mission de Morricone ; Schindler 's list de el otro Williams ; El padrino por Nino Rota , como la m & uacute ; sica de The entertainer por Joplin . Este productode Joun Williams es relmente una joya .  
2	  Besides the obvious stuff - plays CD / CD-R / CD-RWs with mp3s or wma files on them , very good FM reception , good AM reception , a boatload of presets for both - this radio has one feature universally ignored by car manufacturers : a line-level input . " iPlug " is just a fancy name for a stereo minijack input on a surface-mountable pod . Awesome . The sound quality was a bit uneven at first , but with the right combination of loudness , EQ & sound profiles built-in , it sounds great . And yes , this thing can pump out some decent bass . Will it vibrate the fillings out of your teeth , vibrate your tag , make your trunk sound like two midgets wrasslin ' aluminim cans in a bag ? No . Sorry , OutKast . Does it sound better than the stock headunit ? Yes . The display is very bright , clear , easy to read and navigate . Few things anger me as much as having to use buttons to change the volume on the radio . Thankfully , this one has a big honkin ' knob you may twiddle and twist to your heart 's content . It also has mute and pause buttons , both of which are a godsend . Did I mention this thing was bright ? Holy crap , is it ever . The six buttons on the right side radiate enough blue light to be visible from the moon . On one hand , it 's great mood lighting when driving at night . On the other hand , the display isn't just visible in direct sunlight - it 's a wonder the sun is visible when the radio is on . There 's no dimmer , so you 'll have to live with it . I 've taken several extended drives at night with this and it doesn't bother me at all . Installation was a breeze with a wiring harness for my car . It took all of fifteen minutes while sitting in the driver 's seat . Looking for a decent radio to replace the stock head unit ? You 'd be hard pressed to do much better than this . ( ps - did I mention the display was bright ? )  
2	  I bought these for my son for Christmas and he says that they are the best made ! He and I both love the way they fit around the back of your head instead of on top . The chord only goes to one side so you don't have the chord hitting you in the chin like most headphones . This is the best style you 'll ever get and you 'll never go back to the old ones .  
2	  I have owned this product for approxitmately 6 months now without any problems , only extreme enjoyment from the ease of use and picture quality I experience . I also own a MAG 19 " flat panel monitor which is fantastic ; but I must say that this Samsung LCD provides a better picture and is only just under the viewable screen size when measured . When eyeballed the Samsmung gives the appearance of being larger than the MAG 19 " . For playing DVD 's or watching TV the Monitor is excellant . If I use the S-video cable I get a quality picture when viewed on my 27 " Sony TV . The picture out to the TV is easy to adjust through the software to suit the preferences of the viewer . In addition games played on this monitor seem to come to life . The image displayed is a soft warm one ; which makes you feel like you can crawl inside the screen and become part of the action . Currently I have three computer systems one using a hi-quality 17 " monitor . The 17 " pales some much in comparison that I am soon to purchase another Samsung 17 " LCD as a replacement . You don't have to believe me ; just go down to your local computer store that carries this product and be amazed when you compare it to other monitors in the store .  
1	  I do not know what happen , but this hard drive is over $ 100 with the case and it seems do not require signature . My package just disappear ! Why it notes that have already delivery ! I will never buy anything from this Store !  
2	  This was excellent service . I was a little nervous ordering over the internet , but delivery and product were top notch .  
1	  I ordered these in December 2010 and that first pair stopped working in May of 2011 . The left side earphone seemingly lost all bass and sounded very tiny . After researching this issue it was clear that it was driver flex . This occurs when pressure pops the small diaphragm on the speaker toward the magnet and it sticks . A shame because they sound great when they work . I called Monster and they told me to send them in . That cost me $ 14 in shipping fees . The new pair arrived about one month later and I enjoyed them until September . Once again I contacted Monster via phone and they told me to send them in . Because this was my second return they offered to send me a free Fedex shipping label . I sent them in the next day and I haven't heard anything since . I have tried emailing them and have received absolutely NO response at all . Nothing ! Every time I call they tell me that the headphones are back-ordered and the estimated arrival is unknown . The only conclusion I can come to is this . Monster is deliberately not sending me the headphones in hopes that I either forget about them or that the 3 year warranty runs out so they can have a real reason to ignore me . This is without a doubt THE WORST customer service I have ever encountered and I beg you , don't get sucked into their black hole of disappointment and failure . The name truly fits this company perfectly . A Monster indeed . UPDATE : I called again on January 10 , 2012 and once again I was told that the Turbine headphones were not in stock . The customer service rep said all I can do is wait . At this point I would like a full refund but that is never going to happen .  
1	  i say this brand and product is garbage i had this but white it sucked i had it before i got a car that had a alpine head unit with ipod interface first when the fm transmitter i hardley got any reception i had to have it really close to a factory head unit would say belkin has the best fm transmitter besides geting a ipod interface for ether factory or aftermarket which i think is best the best three brands for after market head unites are alpine , pioneer , and kenwood if wanting to have a ipod for the factory check out [ .. ] they make products for factory radios but just fm transmitter i would belkin is best  
1	  I NEVER received this product I purchased . Now , I am going through the pain of trying to get my gift certificates reimbursed and the extra money BACK into my account . I tried contacting the seller MANY times with no response . Amazon was great and very understandable , but SAL ADAMS , INC . is a joke .  
1	  Remote does a lot , but is bulky . And the annoying thing is that the remote keeps losing its programming for certain stored devices . It is easy to reprogram , but sometimes it is as often as daily . Very annoying !  
1	  I just received this clock for Christmas and want to return it . The green display is so bad that you cannot read the time unless you look down at the clock . It is terrible .  
1	  My mouse also simply quit working after about a month . Not a bad product if you don't mind purchasing a new one every 30 days .  
2	  I am thorougly delighted with this microwave popcorn popper . It is easy to use , a cinch to clean , and it makes delicious popcorn quickly . It is amazing how good it tastes with nothing added !  
2	  This product performs very well and is a good buy for those wantign to enhance the sound of their entertainment system that did not come with this type speaker .  
1	  I bought this in Feb of 2008 . I 'm a very casual picture take and have probably taken less than 1,000 pictures total during the life of the camera . I am very careful with this camera ( as with all electronics ) and it is majorly babied . It has never been dropped , exposed to water , nothing . I have an excellent case with full padding for it . It takes great pictures outside . Inside is a different matter-they often turn out blurry and fuzzy no matter what you do . They tend to over or under exposure which is super frustrating . The setting for auto flash is awful-over exposure all the time . As for the features I am not that familiar as I use this mostly to take pics of the kids and pets . I don't change settings . I do like the Best Shot feature and otherwise the camera is easy to use . I got mine in gold and I love the color and look of the camera . The problem : About a month ago it stopped recognizing the SD Memory card . I tried all sorts of cards-some it recognizes and I take a pic or two and then when I load to my laptop my laptop can't find the formatting . It 's random . These are basic SD cards-nothing fancy . SanDisk and other decent brands ( in other words not cheap crappy ones ) . I did buy an extended warranty and I 'm hopeful they will fix it . But I 'm very unhappy with the fact that this happened . Had i over used it or abused it I 'd probably just chalk it up to that and move on . But to baby a product so much-I expect to get more than 2 years out of a camera . The camera this replaced was an old Kodak that was over 10 years old and still worked fine ( but it was not digital ) . Lame . Severely lame . You know I decided I could live with the blurry pic 's ( maybe due to the time lag between when you press and when it actually takes the pic which is much longer than other cameras ) inside so I mostly use it outside but now I can't even take any pic 's as the internal memory holds 2 photo 's . Hello . 2 ? So I really need that SD card . Due to this I cannot recommend this camera .  
1	  I am extremely disappointed with the Rio Carbon - I would not recommend it . In the first month , I had many problems with the player not starting , the player completely freezing , and the player constantly shutting down in the middle of play . The final straw was when the jogger dial caved in . The player had not been dropped or jolted in anyway . When I sent the player in , they sent me back a " refurbished , " i.e. USED player . This used player was heavily scratched up on the back . I did not pay full money for a new Rio Carbon only to receive a used one . And now , I am having the exact same problems with this " new " player . The jogger dial has once again caved in without provocation . The player continuously shuts down in the middle of play . And to top everything , the customer service is highly adversarial and certainly not helpful or sympathetic . My advice ? Stay clear of Rio players .  
2	  This case is awesome . It lets you view and access easily every part of the ipod , including use of the wheel . It 's like the cover isn't there but you can see it is . The only poroblem is it doesn't come with instructions to let you know you need to remove the inside padding for the 80 gig ipod 's . At first I thought it didn't fit but by accident the inside padding got caught on the case and I figured out that , duh ! , you need to remove it and it fits so tight now . I hope the other person that wanted to return their 's finds this out . The belt clip acts like a prop to watch your ipod without it being flat . Over all I really love this product . The best thing is , for the first time I found an ipod accessory under $ 20.00 . Amazing !  
1	  Does not work with the item that it sells . Why sell them together ? Buy a cordless phone and this item has nowhere to connect .  
2	  This plugs into the RCA analog outputs on the PS3 cable allowing me to plug in my Plantronics GAME COM 367 Headset into the outputing 3.5mm female of the adapter .  
2	  My husband and I had so much fun making applesauce and now he 's looking for more apples which have been in abundance this year . Never thought I 'd say making applesauce was an easy , fun project but it truly is . Bought our daughter one for her birthday and she says it 's the best gift ever . We did then have to go find apples for her too !  
1	  I am sure the product is just fine . I did't pay attention to the dimensions . I have an old school ipod Nano 1G and it does not fit in the least .  
1	  After 2 months , RIO had to replace the Nitrus due to a hard drive failure . After taking almost 3 weeks dealing with Rio , finally it was replaced on April 8 . Today the replaced unit failed exactly the same way . I now will try to get our $ back or have it replaced . I will never buy another Rio product . 2 failures and customer service was NO service . Time for an Ipod !  
1	  While using the card on my canon T1i Rebel on vacation , the card had a sudden " crash " . I was no longer able to use the card on my camera or view the files on my PC . Had lost all pictures .  
1	  I just spent 3 hours with tech support and was finally informed that this unit is not supported by XP SP3 . They are working on compatibility problems with another product , thus this is not on the current queue for upgrade . EXTREMELY disappointing support from a company such as cisco .  
1	  This product requires that you first download a CD onto your comp before the computer even recognizes the MP3 player ! I downloaded everything 3 times and my computer would not recognize the MP3 player . I spent hours on it ! Also , their costumer service line is in Germany and they have no costumer servies in the US . Therefore , no one can help you . Good luck trying to figure out how to use it !  
1	  This webcam does not work well with windows xp , ( Home and Professional ) and windows 2000 . Software given is old and outdated . whole package is not worth for money . Logitech is much better in quality . Stand is really a pain . Moreover technical assistance and other customer service are really bad . Will Never buy again from creative . Company sucks .  
2	  I use this cable with my Nikon D40x . It comes in handy when we are travelling and want to have a quick slide show on a bigger screen . Output can be in PAL or NTSC . Its great to have in your camera bag . I believe the cable comes with the D80 and above . If you don't have one , its wise to get it .  
1	  The reviews I read prior to purchasing the earphones gave me the impression that the product was of exceptional quality . However , my experience was less than satisfactory . The quality and volume level was very inconsistent . Without adjusting the volume controls , the volume would range from loud to soft for no apparent reason .  
1	  I purchased this to put on my desk at work , but after unpacking it , it didn't work with my iphone or my itouch . It does work with my much older ipod , but the sound quality isn't the greatest . It 's great for my 10 year old for in her room because she can't turn it up too loud or it starts to sound bad . So , for the price , it 's good for a young kid who might not notice sound quality , but that 's about it . They need to update the description for this item so everyone is aware it doesn't work with the ipod touch or iphone .  
1	  Ran out of power after 3 weeks of use The battery was a totally unsatisfactory purchase and should not be offered for sale .  
2	  We purchased this as a family gift for Christmas after getting a plasma TV . It is awesome . It was easy to set up , though you do need the models of all your AV equipment . It took about 1/2 an hour . The best part is that my teenagers now seem able to turn off the tv , tuner and dvr ! If you are willing to take the time , it is far better than juggling remotes .  
2	  I bought this B + W filter for about $ 25 on Amazon after much deliberation . Should I get the cheap TIFFEN filter , the better HOYA filter , or the original PANASONIC filter , for my Lumix FZ-35 ? The tiffen filter is cheap but many people says it it not of great quality - this is not a multicoated lens , so it may affect image quality . The Panasonic filter is perfect but just way too expensive . The HOYA seemed just perfect , only $ 20 bucks , I can't go wrong , but then I noticed a lot of people saying that it gets dirty fast and is hard to clean / is delicate - This turned me off . Then I came across this B + W 46mm UVA Haze filter . There were only 5 reviews but the users swear by this product / brand . I was convinced enough to but it and I am very pleased with the results . It is not as delicate as the HOYA and performs well , no distortions or imperfections . The packaging might make you think otherwise but as soon as you pick up this filter you see that construction is solid ; high quality optics in a brass ring that fits my LUMIX FZ-35 perfectly . Two things you need to know about this filter . 1 ) like all filters it will change the final picture taken somewhat . If you understand filters , this is a no brainer . But in most cases this is for the better , this filter will bring out more details in bright and / or reflective surfaces . 2 ) This filter , though well made has a very thick and heavy ring , like I said earlier , it 's brass not plastic . I am not sure if this will affect zoom speed but make sure it can fit the clearance left when your zoom lens retracts , so that you can put the lens cap on . All things said , this is a great filter , no regrets . You have to decide the best filter for your camera and needs but in general , cheap or expensive , a UV filter is essential since it serves second duty of protecting your precious lens . Much easier to buy a new filter than a new camera !  
1	  The primary purpose of this cable is to allow the user to connect two computers via serial port for file ( and sometimes printer ) sharing . While this still works , only DOS 6.22 and Windows 9x support it ( under INTERLNK or " Direct Cable Connection " ) , it 's very slow , and it 's a whole lot of trouble . I recommend purchasing a low-cost Ethernet or phone-line networking product instead-both are much faster , easier to set up , and will work with ( and between ) many operating systems . Overall recommendation : purchase this cable only if you * must * fileshare with an MS-DOS based system and cannot install a network card .  
1	  The Finepix A310 was a disappointment to say the least . I got an excellent deal on the camera but because of it 's image noise , the camera suited no purpose . I read the reviews regardin the noise , but assumed it was an exaggeration . It was no exaggeration . Do not purchase this camera if you are going to use it to take pictures ( AKA : Don't buy this camera ) The image noise and blurriness in pictures will disappoint you . In my testing I compared the image noise of this camera to that of a Finepix 2650 ( 2MP ) , Nikon 2100 ( 2MP ) , and Canon Powershot A70 ( 3MP ) . In all these cases , the Finepix A310 faired far worse . I have returned my Finepix A310 for a Canon PowerShot A70 . Couldn't be happier .  
1	  Mine lasted all of 2 years and now it has stopped working . Up until now , I have never had a receiver last less than 7 years , so I am a little peeved . I ordinarily have good luck with Sony products , so I am fairly disappointed that this receiver died so soon . And FYI , I keep all of my electronics on surge protectors ..  
1	  Device cannot sustain a wireless connection longer than 1 minute . Tried all the " workarounds " , such as switching channels and bands . Happens on two different laptops and 2 different iPhones . The web interface is also needlessly difficult and illogical to navigate . Go elsewhere . This device is garbaage .  
1	  It was okay while it worked . Sound quality wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either and microphone quality was decent . The inline volume control and microphone switch were convenient . Unfortunately it didn't last . The main problem was the cord . Despite being rather thick it developed bad connections in many places . The volume control also became scratchy . Finally one of the drivers broke . Because of all these problems I cannot recommend this headset .  
2	  I have two older model Walkmans and I dropped both of them by accident and the cassette tape player feature no longer works . To my surprise , when I went to several local stores , I couldn't find a similar Walkman for sale . I guess with the i-Pods and other new technology , the tape players are being phased out . I bought a newer model Sony Walkman at Target and the sound quality of the tape was so awful I took it right back . These players that only use one battery have terrible sound quality I 've found . The FM radio stations had terrible reception , too . I found this Sony WMFS499 Sports Walkman for sale here on Amazon . com and purchased it and I love it ! Since I use my Walkman for walking and running , I need a durable player that can withstand being dropped and getting damp in the rain , and the case on my new player seems indestructible . The sound quality of both the FM radio and tape player are fantastic ! I decided to buy another one to have as a spare in case I lose this one . That sounds kind of crazy , but having a good tape player for exercise is important to me and I don't want to ever risk being without my Sports Walkman .  
1	  I had problems by order of importance to me with my first 2 because : 1 . Stylus interface to screen-req 'd excess pressure-alignment to icons inconsistent - after repeated calibration-text inconsistent , i.e. " I " comes up with " F " as worst onehappened with other letters ( both units ) 2nd unit better butstill had " I " problem though lesser extent . 2 . Monochrome screen is hard on my eyes - decided color is best . 3 . Screen size is too small . Prefer the larger though bulkierwider screen . Currently owner of a 2 meg Palm IIE . I have a basis of comparison as to sytlus pressure which is fine with this unit . The " new and improved " were polar opposite on this score .  
1	  As with so many others , I was quite happy with my Samsung 46 " LCD ( model LNT4665F ) .. for the first year . Then the image stopped working . The sound is fine , but no image . Samsung simply will not fix it , repairing the problem is either going to A ) cost you almost as much money as the new tv did , or B ) require you to do a lot of research on the web , buy specialty parts yourself , and then have the expertise needed to open the tv , remove defective capacitors from the power board and solder new ones on , or have a friend who will do it for you . Instead of buying this tv , you should just burn the money , wait exactly one year , and then spend about four weeks punching yourself in the face . They 're equivalent experiences . Sony makes far better , longer-lasting products for slightly more money up front .  
1	  I just purchased one of these because I 'm counting down the space on my computer , especially now that I 'm doing home movie editing on it . I thought this would be the perfect storage solution for my photo , video and audio files . However , I was a little leery . Good Thing ! As people have noted , it is ridiculously easy to set up . But , I did notice right away a nasty vibration . It had my whole desk throbbing . Mmm . I wondered if that was normal . Decided to live with it a few days before transferring files . Good thing - The morning of the third day , no power . Dead player . No lights , no nothing . The thing just croaked ! So glad I hadn't moved my files ! I purchased it elsewhere and will be returning it pronto . I 'll not be buying another . I 'll try a different brand this time . Too bad , I was so excited . I 'd give it no stars , but that wasn't a choice .  
2	  I got this camera for my 18th birthday , last year . Since then I have taken over 3000 pictures with this camera . The video quality is alright , and can be difficult when making movies , but it is a camera , not a VIDEO camera . I was able to make a documentary video with this camera , but it was rather difficult once on the computer . I mostly edited the content on the camera . Such a nice feature ! The indoor does take a while to actually take the picture . For faster shutter times , hold the button half way down , until a green circle shows on the screen , then snap the shot . That use is better if you are waiting for something to happen . Everything else is great ! The firework selection does awesome artwork with different light-styles . I am ever-finding new things to do with the camera . It has been to camps and back , it has been to disneyland , and even horseback riding . The camera isn't small , but it is small enough to put in a pocket and sneak into Grad-Night ! The self-portrait selection goes over really well with teenagers today . An upgraded memory card is suggested . Overall , this camera is the best I 've seen out there . Great quality , HUGE LCD , and so many functions it is easy to get lost in the camera . :-) I love the calendar feature : the camera can store the pictures by what day the picture was taken on . Don't want to go looking for that one picture to show your mom ? Use the calendar and search through a lot less pictures !  
1	  I bought this card for my Samsung T809 and it did not work . I called Samsung and Kingston and both told me that the other needed to " create a software update on their products " . So now I use it for my Casio camera . It 's a little slow at loading ( I think it 's because I have to use the included SD adapter ) but it 's okay . I suggest SanDisk and Dana-Elec brands , which I 've had good experiences with .  
1	  I cannot print out even 10 pages without jams .. just terrible .  
2	  I 've owned this item since Feb . 2003 . During that time I 've used it in a variety of settings , but mostly with a desktop in a home office . The transfer rate is slow by 2009 standards so I am replacing it , but for this price and given how well it has worked in continual service for almost 7 years I am extremely happy with it . The design is good and clearly the quality is high . I would definitely recommend it to anyone , unless transfer rate is your primary concern .  
2	  I purchased this card for my G4 Dual 800 Quicksilver ( 2001 ) . I had bought a generic usb 2.0 card at Best Buy that would seem to be working fine but then lock up once the device I had plugged into it was pulled out . The Sonnet Allegro card did the same thing the first time I tried it and I was ready to return it when I switched PCI slots , on a whim . Now it works perfectly . I have a feeling the problem is with my computer and not the card itself . If you are having problems with add-on PCI cards , I suggest you try switching slots before sending them back .  
1	  This case is definitely not what I expected from the pictures and reviews . It looks and feels very cheap and flimsy . The fact that it is impossible to hotsync while using it just adds to the frustration . Definitely not a match for such a fine product as my Palm Vx .  
2	  This is a very nice pair of binoculars . They are very comparable to the more expensive German made high end optics at a quarter of the price . The other models I looked into costs around $ 500 . The phase coating is a really nice feature and makes this pair give brighter images at low light compared to a standard pair . The rubber cover has a nice feel , it 's lightweight and compact so I take it everywhere . It 's rugged and well made . The no fault warranty is a very nice plus as I don't have to worry about damaging it , even if it 's my fault . A high end feel and performance at a great price .  
1	  The item arrived in a separate metalic envelope without any instructions . I plugged it into my computer . My computer didn't recognize it . I tried to install it through control panel and my computer didn't recognize it there either . It may work at my work site because my computer is newer there , but who knows . I don't recommend to the average computer software user .  
2	  Fast delivery , worked fine , couldn't ask for much more . Memory was packaged in original retail packaging . Had purchased other memory from another internet site and it was not recognized at all . I am very happy with this purchase .  
2	  A GREAT pair of phones ! Believe it or not , the last pair of these I bought was in 1998 for $ 22 ! Back then the headband was metal instead of plastic but the earphones appear to be the same and sound GREAT . In December 2011 the old pair finally gave out , a frayed wire . THIRTEEN YEARS OF EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE ! I HATE " ear buds " ! HATE em ! Ear buds are uncomfortable and block out outside sound which can be dangerous in certain situations , like when you 're mowing your lawn , jogging or when your spouse is screaming at you . These are adjustable , " rest " in your ears instead of clogging them , are ultra lightweight and produce great sound .. and they are CHEAP ! I am NOT a sound aficionado so I would NEVER buy a pair of BOSE ear buds for $ 80 ! ( WHY ? ) Personally , I think that would be stupid and a waste of money in an effort to appear " cool " , like buying RAYBAN sunglasses for $ 130 . Anyway , take my word for it , these are a TRUE bargain ! I recommend them HIGHLY ! Thank you SONY for continuing to manufacture these ! One more thing - SONY uses minimal packaging with these ! Very earth smart !  
1	  If you like a lottery and have $ 10 to spend on something , try buying this cable . If you win , you get $ 30 worth product , just of lower quality . If you lose you get what I get - piece of cable that doesn't work . Connected laptop to the TV and there 's no signal ( works with other 6 ' cable for $ 8)  
2	  It is the extra satisfaction that you have done all it takes to enhance your image  
2	  This is an original Sony battery . I bought the latest Sony camera DSCHX200V camera from Dubai and wanted an extra battery . Have been trying for the last two months since I have made the purchase from Jumbo electronics in Dubai . Finally I could order it online from amazon and it arrived in good shape and works well . Thanks amazon for obtaining products when it is not available at Sony Dubai also . Would highly recommend it .  
1	  Looks nice , light , incredibly small , great features , unfortunately mine only lasted 6 days . Completely stopped working , fortunately J & R took it back with no hassle .  
1	  This radio has fine reception on AM and FM ; however , at this price the SSB should work too . It does not . Knowing that SSB reception can be enviroment dependent I tried several different times on several different days in city and country . I also used the attached antenna and a 23 foot external antenna . Trying to get help from Sangean is difficult and costly . They require money up front with no promise of a fix . If you want SSB reception forget this radio .  
1	  This cheap south korean import has big mood swings . 90 % of the time i can't get it to play my mp3 discs , and for no apparent reasons . i thought it was my particular one , so i went back and exchanged for another sealed box , but same problem . after 2 months , the door on the vcr came off loose ! i total regret this purchase , esp . since i could have gotten a jvc one for only ten bucks more .  
2	  I waited for a product like this for many years , I was worried about it having only 2.1 megapixels , but I said to myself let 's try it , I used to have a 3.2 megapixel from Sony and no comparison the photos I 've taken with Panasonic camera are way over in quality and with that zoom there is no need to crop a picture to zoom in the part I want to print , loosing quality in the previous procedure . Leica Lens are the difference , Does anyone know that LEICA built microscope Lens , that is why this camera pays for it own . From nature lovers to family pictures it is great and easy to use , if you just are looking for a point and shot use the heart selection , if you are on the photo lover side of manual control use all the other . In few words , great camera .  
1	  I live in a city where radio frequencies are not widely available ; I cannot find a frequency where I can " only hear static " or where " Both neighbor frequencies are available " . I was very disappointed to find these requirements on the instructions inside and not on any review or product description . If I go on the country side it works depending on which cities I pass on by . The sound is not perfect as a direct input to your radio . My Only advice , check you radio frequencies before you buy , it might work well if you live in ALASKA !  
1	  This item is such garbage ! The only way the receiver stays on when docked into the boom box is by pushing down very hard and keeping your hand there or putting a water melon on top of the receiver balanced by a water bottle . I 've exchanged my boom box twice and receiver once-the manufacturer will not refund me , ahh such frustration ! Not to mention 3 times I 've had to stand in line at the post office and all the money spend on shipping and insurance . Save yourself the headache do not purchase this product .  
1	  I bought this a year ago and it just stopped playing DVDs . It says it cannot read any DVD I have anymore .. and it just started doing that in the middle of a movie . CD 's still work . Of course w / Sony 's support it is cheaper to buy a new one than have one repaired . Shop for a better quality player .  
1	  When I upgraded the firmware on this router ( from v1.21 to 1.32NA ) did I create a bug-riddled , unusable device ? Or are my problems really just a hardware manufacturing problem ? I 'm a SecureSpot user , but my DLink DSD-150 - the little SecureSpot box that filters websites for the entire network - broke . Rather than replacing my failed DSD-150 with another , I bought this DIR-655 because it has built-in SecureSpot . That it 's an N-network is just an extra nice feature , but I won't need it yet . The installation was very frustrating . Keep in mind , this is only the second router I 've ever installed - I don't do this for a living . So when I 'm greeted with an instruction poster that says , " IMPORTANT : For the wizard to work , the computer must be connected to the Internet and be online . If you have disconnected any hardware please re-connect your computer back to the modem and make sure you are online " - I 'm immediately confused . You mean , I 'm supposed to plug-in my old router firstly , pop the install CD in , maybe download a firmware update or something ? The instructions should more plainly explain if the old router needs to be in place before you begin the new router install or not , or whether you should plug-in your new router ( and remove the bit about your computer needing to be connected to the Internet ) . Maybe what D-Link meant is perfectly intuitive to you ; it wasn't to me . ( Turns out , I just needed to plug-in the new router - which , of course , couldn't be connected to my Internet-connected computer , as I was just now installing the new router ! ) . Once I got past that , I was frustrated with doing some initial configuration just enough to connect to the Internet , download a firmware update file , flash the router , then start all over from scratch again . I * hate * when brand-new devices come with outdated firmware ! The user interface is ugly and very unintuitive . Do you know where you 'd look if you have a choice between " Tools " and " Advanced " tabs ? If you spend a lot of time - a LOT of time - you 'll figure it out , I 'm sure . But how many people want to spend time learning the management tool for their router ? The interface has lots of wasted space ( a 1 " banner at the top of the browser window that just says " D-Link " , and when you scroll down on the page , the tabbed headings disappear because the interface doesn't use panes . The way you plug-in port forwarding settings has to be one of the ugliest implementations ever - how can you make something so easy so ugly and hard-to-read ? As a SecureSpot user , you would think that you could just assign this new router to your SecureSpot account . You can't . Stupidly , every SecureSpot device ( the DSD-150 or a router ) is associated with one and only one SecureSpot account . Upgrade your hardware , and you have to create a new account all over again . Is that STUPID or what ? And then , you have to uninstall the thin client from every PC you 've got , only to reinstall it again using the new account you 've created . Perhaps the worst part now for me is that this stupid router is rebooting itself periodically . Why ? I have no idea . So now I 've got to do web searches to figure out why , because heaven help me if I have to spend hours on the phone with a D-Link tech who will ask that I tear into my network . ( I might add that my old router , the steller Microsoft MN-700 , * never * rebooted itself like this D-Link is currently doing ) . Because of the confusing , ridiculously long installation process ( especially for SecureSpot users ) and because of the unwanted , unexpected rebooting that this router is doing , I think this device gets a well-deserved one-star review . - September 20 , 2009 UPDATEI called D-Link just to see if their support could help me . After asking me the same questions two and three times ( which model of router ? which version of the firmware is installed ? ) the technician concluded this is a bad router , and suggested returning / exchanging it . Amazon 's customer service is EXCELLENT , so I 'm getting a replacement router delivered early this week . ( Why didn't I just return it ? I 'm just curious to know whether the problem is really a one-off , hardware manufacturing problem , or something else ) . DO NOT UPGRADE THE FIRMWARE ! I think I may have caused my problems by upgrading to the latest version of the firmware , which is v1.32NA . If you go to D-Link 's forum for the DIR-655 , you 'll see a LOT of very angry D-Link customers who upgraded their flash to the latest version , only to have irresolvable problems afterwards . The upgrade to v1.32NA cannot be downgraded , which is why people are so hopping mad . The shipped version of the DIR-655 I received had the A4 hardware version and v1.21 of the firmware . There are * two * flavors of the v1.21 firmware , one that has SecureSpot , and one that doesn't ( stupid ! ) . I 'm hoping the version that comes out-of-box has SecureSpot already installed . Although not perfect , it seems a lot people have had satisfactory service with the v1.21 firmware . So if you get this router , don't upgrade the firmware ! Let D-Link come out with a rock-solid version that won't cause you trouble . Once I get the replacement router and install it , I 'll see how it goes , and post back here . SEPTEMBER 22 , 2009 UPDATEReplacement DIR-655 arrived today . It has v1.21 of the firmware , but there are 2 versions of v1.21 ( which , I know , doesn't make sense ) , and the out-of-box version is the firmware WITHOUT SecureSpot . So , you have to upgrade the firmware to the v1.21 WITH SecureSpot - an added inconvenience and just another chance for something to go wrong . SEPTEMBER 24 , 2009 UPDATESame problem , even with the replacement . The router just reboots itself , and tonight , after 17 hours of uptime , it began fitfully rebooting over and over in rapid succession . Who needs to deal with that junk ? This replacement gets returned to Amazon . I 've reinstalled my old Microsoft MN-700 g-network router . Sheesh !  
2	  We are happy with the product so far . One small problem is that it takes a while to get signals .  
1	  The only good thing about these earphones are the actual buds that go into your ear . They are comfortable . On the other hand , I don't see how the wraps fit anyone 's ears . I have pretty big ears and they are still quite loose on me . The sound is very poor . If you like earphones that lack bass , then these are for you . My iPod earphones blow these things out of the water . This is my first review . I usually don't like wasting my time writing reviews , but I just couldn't resist on this one .  
2	  The people at Canon have really done a beautiful job making a very beginner-friendly D-SLR . Right out of the box , I was able to take beautiful , frame-worthy photos of my children . The value was amazing . Compared to other brands , the Rebel XT far outshone the rest at this price . I generally use this one as a " point-and-shoot . " I really like the fact that it takes the photos of my two small children ( just turned two , and ten months old ) INSTANTLY . Digital point-and-shoots take so long that the girls have moved by the time the camera takes the picture ! Overall , great value for the price , great beginner camera all around . I 'm impressed .  
1	  Sony is famous for it 's products breaking down just before the warranty ends and this is no exception . This camera suddenly started flashing a code of E : 61:10 and the focus stopped working . To fix it will cost about $ 170 and is not covered by the warranty ( there are scratches on the camera so they assume you dropped it - I didn't ) . On another note , the included 4 mb memory stick is too low . You have to buy a separate 128 mb stick to take a decent number of photos ( Lexar sells one for about $ 50 that worked fine ) . If you want a digital camera , save a little more money and get at least a 3 or 4 megapixel and please MAKE SURE YOUR NEW CAMERA IS NOT A SONY if you want it to work longer than a few months !  
2	  I was initially skeptical that an HDMI cable costing less than $ 5 would be any good , let alone actually work . However , using a 1080p television and a Playstation 3 , the picture looks fantastic and the audio is great as well . I have had it for a few weeks now and it has had no problems so far . Definitely recommend !  
2	  I have an APC Smart 1500 UPS which uses a RBC7 battery . As an APC partner , I wanted to get an APC replacement but did not want to pay almost double . The American Battery Co . RBC7 replacement battery has a two year warrantee . It was received ( double boxed ) via Fed Ex in one day . Except for the label , the battery was exactly the same as the original . APC is not a battery manufacturer ( I suspect the American Battery Co . may be the OEM for APC ) . Recycling the old battery was easy and free at Auto Zone ( dozens of other site were also listed on the internet ) .  
1	  it is adorable and works well for a while anyway . my 2 year old watches barbie movie dvds before nap time and like another review i read , it stopped reading the dvds ( unbalanced ) now i have a princess tv , clock , boombox and no dvd player . i returned it to the store , but there weren't any left for an exchange . needless to say my daughter is in a horrible mood before nap time because she cant watch her barbie movies up in her room for quiet time .  
1	  I purchased the CX7000F printer as I already own the RX500 printer and was very satisfied with it . After receiving the printer and downloading the drivers from Epson that supposedly would work with my Vista Home Premium operating system , I attempted to load the drivers . The printer driver installed without a hitch and works fine . The scanner driver , however , would not install and I have spent over 2 hours with Epson on the phone to no avail . They advised me it wasn't their problem and that I should reload the operating system . The scanner and fax both work fine as a standalone , but I can't access them through the computer . To make matters worse , I have only had the unit for about 2 weeks and have only printed a few black and white documents from MS Word and from the internet and my ink levels are down to 36 % for all four cartridges . At this point it is my intention to consider it a lesson learned and to return the unit within the 30 day window .  
2	  They are getting harder to find but I still love to comparison shop this stuff . I still make it a point to check out VCRs and the like whenever I get a chance to get out to an electronics store . The quality and dependability of SONY 's VCRs unfortunately fluctuates exasperatingly . SONY made some very good VCRs in the past . SONY 's SLV-679HF VCR demonstrates a genuine effort to return to the type of quality product they were once known for with some good features . My daughter 's roommate owns one of these units as it so happens and this unit makes very good recordings . Pre-recorded tapes look excellent as well . What really impressed me was the playback image of EP recordings . I observed that black & white movies recorded in EP look better than those recorded in SP , which is a little hard to explain , but others agreed on that point . I have found this true of all the recent SONY VCRs that I have seen on the market since 2002 . Unfortunately , I could not find many of these units on the shelf anymore . They were out there once I suppose and then they seem to have vanished . This VCR , the one I saw , really impressed me .  
1	  I went through two monitors before Amazon stopped sending them due to widespread quality problems . The first was a complete blur . The second was bright and clear on the right side with a greenish tint on the left . The middle of the bottom bent upward and the upper left was a blur . I tried using the Viewsonic web site to resolve the issues . There is very little technical information on their site . I got an email after two days from Viewsonic tech support stating that the monitor was broken . I originally selected the monitor based on the technical specs which showed it to be one of the sharpest 19 " monitors on the market . The monitor looks great when it is turned off . Fortunately , the free shipping and return policy kept me from losing money on the deal . So , 5 stars to Amazon , 1 star to Viewsonic .  
1	  I bought this stereo nearly a year ago and it was working great until a couple weeks ago . At first the CD player was having troubles , wouldn't recognize or play certain CDs ( regardless of type : original or burned CD ) . Then , one day , the sound just didn't work . No sound coming out of the speakers or the headphone jack at all . There are several online reports of this being a common problem with this model . Aparently it 's not worth the repair ..  
1	  Although almost everybody says the good words , I should point out several things which make me very unhappy : 1 ) Hard to set up due to the poor documentations . If you have something wrong with the installation , that is really a pain . 2 ) The left and right mouse buttons are cramed together . I don't know why logigech came up with this design . This is an exception compared with other logitech mice . 3 ) There are no cap and num lock lights on the keyboard . When you boot up the machine and enter the password , got to lose some time . Anyway , I probable go for the Microsoft intelli mouse and keyborad combination .  
1	  I bought this product because I 'm impressed with the feature it has , and as a customer support engineer I need the computer case that has a professional look at the customer place but should be comfortable enough to carry on the street . Most of the time I carry it as a backpack . But it 's not tough as it should be . It last only 1 month and the inner side between the padded computer compartment began to tear . Because it has a lifetime warranty , I went back to the shop and got a new one . After a month plus the inner side ( I will say it as a weakness ) starting to tear again and then I will go back to the shop to replace it .  
2	  I purchased these cause I started to get into golf . Lets face it , I lost plenty of balls the first holes . These were great to have for when I played with my buddies . I did not have to worry about not having enough . I dont know much about quality or what is consider a & # 34 ; good gold ball & # 34 ; , but for recreation use , I like these .  
1	  " I have had this since 2/06 , after approximately 4 months the tv stopped working . Service was called and it took 1 month to order the part . Three weeks later the same part failed and service was called again . They were told this part was on back order with no estimated time for it to come in . I contacted Philips and was told they can do nothing for me . I then asked for a phone number for customer service and the lady REFUSED to provide me with it . One would have to ask themselves why they would purchase a product from a company like this ! "  
1	  There was no indication that this product would not work with Vista . I wanted to use it to send audio to my BT headset or to my BT receiver connected to my stereo . I 'm sure it works great with some other operating systems . Jabra Tech Support said to keep checking their web site for an update . After 3 months , there is still no sign of a Vista driver , even though many other products have been upgraded to support Vista .  
1	  Nice all around features EXCEPT , the ink cartridges frequently clog and have to be replaced way too often . If I had it to do all over , I would definitely not purchase this printer .  
1	  Beware of KINGSTON rebates ! Of course , I hope your experience would differ , if you were to buy Kingston product ( s ) , but mine was terrible . I bought a Kingston CompactFlash card that offered a $ 50 mail-in rebate . I promptly ( as in , the day AFTER I received the item delivery ) went to photocopy my rebate certificate and UPC code and sales receipt ; then sent it all on its merry way . Yes , I was well within the rebate period , both for the purchase AND for the postmark date . My purchase was a valid retailer ( think HUGE online e-tailer ) . The rebate REQUIRED sending THE ENTIRE ORIGINAL UPC label , which was like the entire outside package for my CF card , about the size of 1 business cards when flattened . No problem . About TWO MONTHS later , I get a letter saying " your rebate request was denied because you failed to furnish the appropriate ORIGINAL UPC code as required by the rebate offer . " Well , now WHAT ? I can't RE-SEND the original ( it was already in their possession ) . I called , and they insisted on repeating what the letter said . I re-sent my PHOTOCOPIES and they said a photocopy is invalid proof of purchase . After another 6 weeks of pursuing this , I figured this is their scam . They simply wouldn't honor the rebate . And without the ORIGINAL UPC in my possession , I couldn't really submit to their requirements . If you 're looking for a RAM upgrade , I 'd suggest you look at a quality company like OCZ ( the BEST ! ) , or Patriot , Geil , or Corsair . If you 're looking for a value Flash Memory Card , I might suggest SanDisk . For one , Kingston does NOT make the best products , they are VALUE-driven products . Two , there are competitors to Kingston with just as good or better value-to-performance ratios at the same prices . Three , Kingston will not stand behind their customer as I have experienced . I urge you to , please , be cautious of Kingston and their rebate scams .  
1	  This cant be the right price - $ 279 ? - I can get 4 rechargeable batteries and a charger for 20 bucks .  
1	  It has been some time since we ordered it , but just got around to hooking up the printer to use it for scanning and the cable is defective . Of course we only paid $ 5.89 for it , so it ain't worth packaging up and sending back for a partial refund . No big deal , but thought I would at least state this in the review . Granted , we should have tested it when we first got it , but we did not and it is what it is . We simply ordered another brand . Btw .. it seems strange that nowhere on the cable is it labeled Belkin .. may be a fake .  
1	  Think you 're getting HP 02 cartridges at a bargain price ? - Not . HP is deceiving you through lack of appropriate disclosure . The cartridges are not nearly the same ink quantity as standard 02 cartridges . When you see the phrase " custom cartridge " , it 's HP 's weasel words for ripping you off .  
1	  Broken record of a review . The print heads hopelessly clogged after about a year . Not only that , when i disassembled as much as i could , i found the ink tube / straw feed to the heads had popped off , which is why nothing at all was coming out . You need to be a surgeon with unattainable instruments to put the tubes back into one another ( they 're both about the same diameter ) . Lexmark = junk , Epson = junk , now i have to try a Hewlett-Packard . This problem is unfixable as my ink stained hand and high blood pressure will attest . Screw you , Epson .  
1	  I use the Expert at work and love it . I tried to save a few bucks and recognized that this one has fewer frills but thought it would be as comfortable . I was wrong . The position of the left click button in proximity to the trackball is strange and it actually causes me to tense up and routinely reposition my hand . Not good . Also , having no scrollwheel is weird , though I can live with that . And don't waste your time installing or downloading the recommended software . It gives you absolutely nothing . This is a very basic trackball . And Kensington 's website is pretty lame when it comes to help . Instead of saving money , I wasted $ 30 . And the packaging is so extreme ( hard molded plastic ) that it 's ruined once you 've opened it and therefore impossible to repackage for return . So as I said , if you 're basing your decision on the fact that you like the Expert , then pass on this one and buy the real thing . You 'll be glad you did . But , if you want a very basic trackball , this may work for you .  
2	  This product works very well . Other products a fraction of the price work just as well in my humble opinion . The key to having good heat sink is to eliminate air bubbles . Instead of using the " scrape method " for application , use the " dot method " and make sure the heat sink is pressed very hard against the heat source and secure tightly . Search youtube for videos explaining .  
2	  I 've had this TV for approximately 6 months now and I think it has great picture quality . Easy to operate and love the HD . Using as a bedroom TV that gets as much use as the main TV . I looked at higher priced HD TV 's and I believe this was the best quality picture for the money .  
1	  I use a Sony RZ Pentium 4 2.80 GHz with a Linksys wireless USB link . This computer comes without a serial port that 's why I had to install a Serial Port . The drivers installation were fine , and it did work ( with some , not all applications ) but when I turned off the computer and turned on again the system stopped recognizing the wireless USB , I restarted the system 5 times until it occured to me that it was something about the belkin port , then I unplugged and restarted and presto ! the Linksys worked again , however , now even with the belkin Port unplugged I have to plug-off and plug-in the Linksys card in order to be able to access the lan . I other words , the Belkin installation spoiled my Wireless connection . Be aware that this product may conflict with some of your USB devices , and since some applications wouldn't work I would try another alternative as a PCI serial port card or a USB to Serial cable from another manufacturer .  
2	  I bought this receiver cause it had a very low price . I just wanted to replace my time damaged Clarion receiver and didn't have enough money to get another of the same brand . I thought this would be a 4-6 weeks temporary radio while I got the money but now it 's staying right where it is . I like the way it sounds and it 's pretty easy to set up . If for some reason you have to disconnect your car 's battery you can set the radio to your likings in less than 2 minutes . The controls are easy to understand and not hard to reach while you are driving . The anti skip feature of the CD player has been tested in virtually destroyed roads , and it has performed great . It doesn't get the 5 stars rate just because its lights are very bright while driving at night . Edit : I dismounted the faceplate and covered the back of the buttons using some white nail polish . Now the glare is in the past . I recommend this console even if you have the money for a more expensive one .  
1	  this antenna didn't improve the reception at all .. it actually turned the unit to static when it was plugged into the Midland WR-300  
2	  not a pro photographer . this product is easy to use and stout enough for my sports camcorder ( 3 # dvd ) mostly in a gym . works great .  
2	  This is a reliable favorite of mine . I personally find these " vertical " ear pieces to be more comfortable that the all-in-ear pieces . It is relatively inexpensive , so they don't last forever , but given the comfort factor and that I use them for the gym , I always get these .  
1	  When I bought the product I had high hopes for what it would do . I am master 's student trying to transcribe my interviews for my thesis . I wanted a product to take my recorder interviews and turn them into written word . This software does not do that . All the software does is allow for you speed up , stop and rewind a recording with your foot . This foot pedal somewhat eases the process but if you did not use a Sony IC recorder the software will not read anything that is not a . wav file . My recorder of course saves the audio files as . wma . So I then had to download conversion software ! The headphones provided with the software and foot pedal are of poor quality especially for the price the product costs . I ended up having to combine the transcription software with Dragon Naturally Speaking to transcribe my interview . It has been a big hassle . I would not recommend this item for if you are expecting a faster and more efficient process .  
1	  this product did not last 6 months . it will not play or record and i cant get the disk out of it . cyberhome will not return by e-mails and i cant get any where when i make a phone call . save your money and buy something else  
2	  After lots of research , I finally chose the ER6is and they 're great . Insertion into the ear canal takes a little practice ( for some reason I can easily insert into my left ear and make a good seal every time but my right ear often takes a couple of tries ) but after some practice it becomes a snap . I have smaller ears and found that the smaller inserts ( blue ) work much better for me . The noise isolation of these is wonderful and the audio clarity and bass response are excellent . I 'm being VERY careful with these as the cable is pretty thin by not removing them by pulling on the cable and keeping them in the included carry pouch . I just couldn't make the leap on the ER-4Ps for more than twice the price and so far , I don't think that I 'm missing much .  
1	  My daughter sent me this camera as a gift for Christmas . The card said it was so I could keep in touch with my new grandson Noah . I was thrilled . It arrived the day before christmas and I ran out to get a memory card as the stores were closing Christmas eve . I ended up getting half of my pictures the next day-literally - a line of picture , a blank line , then a line of picture and then another blank line all down the picture . The problem , according to my computer savy son-in-law was that one of the heads wasn't recording and that was also the head with the sound . I sent the camera back to Amazon and received a new one . Good service from Amazon . I didn't get to use it again until February and I brought it to Florida where I learned some of the complicated menu selections . I came home pretty pleased with myself for having learned so much that I had some decent pictures from Disney . I took the camera to a Jimmy Fund ski race fundraiser and the camera jammed up . I could not get it out of video mode to camera mode so I could record . I tried everything . I called Sharp who told me to send it for repair to a company in the midwest . They 've had it since March and the parts are backordered until May so only God knows when the camera will be fixed and operable . I will NEVER by a Sharp product again . Very dissatisfied with this service . I am on my way to the Bahamas next week without my camera . I am not a happy photographer !  
2	  I needed a desktop power strip to fit underneath a riser I 've mounted some equipment on , and this Belkin fit perfectly . I particularly like the placement of the outlets on both the top and front side . Not much else to say other than it works great and is very compact .  
1	  If you are looking into buying this AP / Router do yourself a favor and look into linksys or dlink ( or even netgear ) . I bought this few months back and never could use it for more than an hour or so before the router dropping my connection . Then the only option is to reboot the router before my laptops can connect back to it . This problem is prominent when you have WEP enabled . I finally went back to using my old linksys 802.11b AP / Router and now use this one solely as a switch . If you are not planning to use WEP or WPA and do not mind occassional drop in connection then you may get away with this . But I would not suggest running AP without password to anyone .  
2	  It is very easy to use and the autoscan is a nice feature . The sound quality isn't amazing but just ok .  
2	  This computer is FAAST . Fast is the only way to describe it . Having TWO G4 processors at 867 MHZ makes this machine absolutely scream through all of the tasks I can put it through . Since OS X takes advantage of both processors as well as the velocity " Altivec " engine , all system tasks are completed instantaneously . Now that more and more applications are being released for OS X , there is no need to boot into OS 9 ( although it is still possible ) . OS X is the future of computing . A Rock solid UNIX foundation ensures that your computer will virtually never crash . I have had mine for almost two months , and the system has never crashed on me . Apps ( Internet explorer , for one ) have crashed before but it doesn't cause a full fledged system lockup . The one thing that you will need to do is buy an extra 512 MB of RAM . In this case , you need PC2100 DDR RAM ( 266MHz ) . The graphics performance of this machine is also quite impressive . I personally bought the Radeon 9000 Pro with my machine but this particular model comes stock with the GeForce 4 MX . This card is good for current games ( Q3 , RTCW , Medal of Honor , Warcraft 3 ) , but the lack of shaders and advanced Anti Aliasing capability mean that games like Doom 3 will struggle to play smoothly . The Specs listed on Amazon 's page are a little misleading . It says , for instance that the machine comes with 1 MB of L2 cache , when in fact it comes with 1 MB of L3 cache as well as 256k L2 cache . the L3 cache really adds an extra kick to the processors ability to crunch information without having to access the RAM or the hard drive . Also , it says the machine is not 3d capable . Huh ? I believe the fact that it has a 3d card makes it quite capable . Amazon 's specs for the combo drive are also incorrect . the CD-RW part of the combo drive can write at 16x and rewrite at 10x . Anyway , from my own experience , this is a wonderful machine that has it waiting for me more than me waiting for it . Highly recommended .  
1	  I bought this product from KB Electronics . Because of this product , my digital camera stopped working . On giving a bad review to this product , KB Electronics offered me 10 % discount on my next product . So , I told them that I would give a good review to them if they can repair my camera . At this they went silent . So , basically this means that they would try to make someone silent with a few dollars , but if they have to fix their problems , then they would forget all morals and turn dumb . I don't know about the current company , but beware of the same thing happening to you guys . It is possible that KB Electronics has started selling the same product by the name of its sister concern - businesses do this all the time !  
2	  Excellent product . Highly recommend ! Canon Metal Neck Strap 1 for All Elph Cameras , 34 " Length  
2	  I tried this card on a canon powershot camera , a nikon coolpix camera , and on my laptop . Works like a charm . My older desktop PC can't recognize the card , but I assume it is a PC issue and not anything wrong with the memory card . I looked around and this was definitely a good deal for a 16GB class 6 card .  
1	  I purchased a similar all - in one model cx5200 last year . I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE SINCE THE FIRST MONTH I BOUGHT THIS PRINTER ! I am truly convincedit is by far THE WORST PRINTER I HAVE EVER USED . I have run all the diagonostics , changed the cartridges over and over AND STILL IT NEVER PRINTS CORRECTLY ! There are no instructions on the website or manual that addresses the problem besides " run nozzle check - clean print head " after 9 times it still doesn't print without lines . I have been using epson printers since the early 90 's . I use one at work so I am famililar with all the quirks of these printers . I have tried EVERYTHING to get this to work . After I clean the heads , run a nozzle check 6-7-8 times MAYBE i 'll get a week that it prints . Then , it stops printing again OR it tells me I need a new cartridge ( which are hard to find , by the way ) . I am getting the feeling I am the only person who bought this printer . I know my one year parts guarantee has run out . I have spent to much money on cartridges I could have bought another printer by now . And actually , I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER EPSON PRODUCT AGAIN .  
1	  I purchased this SD card because it was " recommended " on the amazon web site for the Kodak digital picture frame . However , the card doesn't work in the frame , or my computer . It may only need to be formatted , or it may not be compatible .. I wouldn't know though , because after 3 phone calls and an email to the customer and tech service " answering machine " and email account in the past week I have had no response ! It is really poor when you buy a new product and can't get in touch with the company for support . The card comes with absolutely no instructions or reccomendations  
1	  Overall , not a bad product . Small , light-weight , easy to use . If you have another CD ripping program and / or a collection of songs in MP3 or WMA format , loading music can be a simple drag-and-drop process using Windows Explorer . I had an issue , however , with the Rio cutting off a few select songs before they were done playing . That 's when I found the black hole called " Rio Customer Support " . First of all , there is no toll-free number to call . There is no way to submit a support issue via email in the US . That combined with limited hours of operation and limited resources with limited skills made for a very frustrating and expensive experience . If you are a software engineer and can design and trouble shoot your own firmware , I recommend this device . Otherwise , stay away !  
1	  Cisco may be engaging in unlawful and deceptive trade practices by stating that this print server will work with " most " type 1 & 2 USB printers . What does " most " mean ? I spent 6.5 hours on the phone with Linksys techs trying to get connected to my Canon i850s . Nothing on the web site , disc manual or box listing printers it would not work with-a clear failure to inform when they have to know it won't . One of the questions the techs ask is whether you are running a multifunction printer . ( I wasn't . ) Apparently this print server does not work with many multifunction printers , but Linksys and Cisco do not state that anywhere that I could find . ( After I buy the thing is not the time to find out I got the wrong product . ) Finally a senior tech came online and said the print server would not work with my printer . I asked him for a list of printers that it would work with and he listed a few , but he said they were not allowed to put the list up on the web site . Whoah ! So that 's why I spend 6.5 hours to find out your product does not work . [ .. ] Others , save yourself the headache , buy someone else 's product .  
1	  I have 2 DYMO Letra Tag Label makers and in general I like them . I use the plastic tape to label my spice jars . While the print holds up to the frequent handling , the labels don't stay stuck to the glass bottles . No matter how carefully I clean the jars before applying the label they start peeling from one end or the other ( and sometimes both ) . They also don't like to stick to the plastic caps . I am disappointed with this product , but haven't found anything better . BTW - The metallic tape was no better .  
2	  it worked out of the box . tv guide is slow to downloadand to go up or down channel it will stop and wait ( pausing picture in frame to freeze ) for the nextchannel to download .. sometimes slow at it . the OTA reception was far better than the dishnetworkhd receiver I had . dish saw 43 channels the samsung unitpicked up 49 .. same antenna and connector . changes channels fast enough for me . only real draw back I have seen is from the tv guide onchannel 54-1 shows 64-1 at bottom of guide . it is whenI exit guide and hit recall it will not go to whatchannel I had prior to 54-1 , it goes to 64-1 . that onlyhappens when using guide . recall works fine otherwise . I 'm using it on a old rca type monitor with dvi . this has hdmi output , hdmi and dvi are not compatible butthey do make a connector to fit and does show picture dimlyso I use component cables . do note incompatibility makespicture not to fit the screen properly .. it is a tvproblem . the dish replacement box that I sent back was farworse as I lost over 40 % of the picture with it . never tested adult gard .. caption and freeze fine . size is small . I will keep this one . note : uses very low power ! 15 watts on 1 watt standbyI do not know if it would work as a second tuner for P-I-P .  
1	  After about 2 months of light use , the camera stopped working . Also , the output format was very difficult to work with . Absolutely will not work on a Mac . The price is coming down greatly .. I saw it for $ 88 at Target .  
2	  IMO , the Audigy by Creative is far better than on board audio of an Asus M4A78-E motherboard . Works great with Windows 7 .  
1	  I actually purchased this lamp in the store and was so excited due to the beauty of the lamp . After I put it together I found that the on / off switch was broken . Then I had to disassemble and return it . I was very disappointed . Maybe it was a fluke , but it was enough to discourage me from buying another lamp from Target .  
2	  I was going to buy a new system for a road trip and found this on line ! It worked great ! Easy Installation , and I thought it was very stable . I like the fact that it can turn slightly . It was much better than I anticipated .  
1	  The Manual for the GyroRemote & Keyboard Suite w / Receiver ( GP260-001 ) is what appears when clicking the Amazon Link included with this item 's description . The actual item for sale here at Amazon is : Wireless RF Keyboard w / Receiver ( GP220-001 ) which does NOT include the GyroRemote mouseand does NOT include the Ultra Professional Optical Mouse . Both of these mice are shown in the Digital Photo on Amazon . com . Amazon pictures two remotes with the keyboard and Amazon includes a link to the manual for the incorrect item ( GyroRemote & Keyboard Suite w / Receiver ( GP260-001 ) ) . By including a link to the incorrect item , Amazon confuses the consumer , and because of this error , Amazon mistakenly implies the GyroRemote is included with the Wireless RF Keyboard . The Description at Amazon states : 88-key Mobile Rf Keyboard with Receiver & 17 Hot Keys 100ft Range by GYRATION . The Gyration Web Site states for this item : 15 conveniently located Internet and multimedia hot keys , so I wonder why Amazon claims it has 17 Hot Keys . 17 and 15 are NOT the same number of hot keys . What you need is either : GyroRemote & Keyboard Suite w / Receiver ( GP260-001 ) ORUltra Professional Optical Suite ( GP270-001 ) . NOTE : Media Center Suite ( GP2100-001 ) includesGyroTools Media Center Control Software for Windows XP Media Center Edition so be sure you have the Media Center Edition ofXP operating system on your computer . I suggest Amazon clarify that the model on their web page does not include the mouse , and perhaps even show a photo of what you will be purchasing at Amazon , by asking gyration . com to allow them to include the digital photo of the Wireless RF Keyboard w / Receiver ( GP220-001 ) which is the actual item sold at Amazon .  
1	  i didnt like this thing . i had to return it . it was way to small for me . it didnt download music . and didnt come with anything to download so your cmp can put it up . i wouldnt do it again , this was my second purchase since my dell one broke im taking some time off b4 i purchase another one . thinking about a ipod .  
2	  Product quality is good .. is according to the price paid .. recommend this product is just what I needed .. all ok  
1	  This product is a piece of junk ( ZERO STARS ) . I got it for a gift < 6 months ago , it no longer functions at all ! Their customer service is worthless . Do not waste your money on anything from this manufacturer .  
2	  Great value and nice lighting . Lens has done everything we 've hoped for including wonderful clarity and color .  
2	  I did my research for about a month before deciding on this little bad boy . The A20 is is all that and more ! My wife who is a Techno-Phobic finds the A20 to be easy to use as well . To quote her , " Is that all I have to do ? " The picture quality is second to none . I was horrified by how quickly the Alkaline AA 's were drained by the camera . But a quick trip to [ the store ] for some NiMH AA 's put an end to that . Do youself a favor and buy two sets . The camera is relatively small and light , but durable ! The LCD is very nice in all lighting conditions . Also , buy the camera bag that was meant for A20 . I purchased mine at [ store ] for $ 9.99 . It is held securely by two velcro straps , so don't worry about it dropping out . The bag has a shoulder strap and a belt loop so it 's your choice how to carry it . The bag will also carry an extra set of batteries and two flash cards . The 8MB card that came with the camera was a bummer , but I purchased a 64MB the same day I purchased the camera and soon thereafter added a 128MB . I 've found that Medium Super-Fine mode will yield about 300 pics on a 128MB card . That 's ALOT of pictures .. I also love the Canon software that was provided . It is EASY to use . My Father who has a Kodak DC3400 , and swore by it , loves the A20 . .. this camera [ is compared ] to much higher priced and larger pixeled cameras . It is not a fair assessment . Take this camera for what it is : A great starter camera ! Yes there are better , but , for the price , quality and the Canon name , you cannot go wrong with this choice !  
1	  These are way too heavy on the bass . I was expecting them to be bass heavy , but not at such of an expense to the rest of the spectrum ; especally because of the good reviews here . There are entire parts of songs I can barely hear that normally stand out . Perhaps others are correcting with an equalizer , a true sign of bad earphones . Either that or people don't know what good earphones should sound like . For now I 'll keep my Zune premium earphone which are so much better than these and use these for the gym .  
2	  I have used these for years . I used to purchase them from Best Buy , then Radio Shack and Office Depot , but they keep being discontinued as the few remaining retailers seem to turn into " Smart Phone Stores " . Now even Memorex themselves have stopped selling to the public . The best thing about these cases are as follows : 1 . They take up half the space as regular cases and protect the DVD well . If one happened to be on the floor and a hefty adult came by and stepped on it , the DVD inside would likely be undamaged , and even the case would probably still be OK . ( Try doing that with an audio CD jewel case ! ) 2 . They are excellent for color-coding , using a particular color for a certain TV series or type of program . ( Purchasing color coded labels from your office supply source helps even more . ) The colors make DVDs easier to locate . For example , it will be easier to locate the documentary on rain forests if you know you put in in a green case . ( The one on ocean life might be in a blue one and the episode about our sun in an orange case , you get the idea ! ) The worst thing about these cases : The quality seems to vary quite a bit . This batch : so far so good . Sometimes you get a bunch with transparent sleeves that aren't connected properly and occasionally a cover that won't close . One more note regarding color-coding .. Pick up at least one package of the CLEAR slim cases ; that will give you one more color variety .  
2	  Word to the wise , THIS SUCKER , LIKE ALL RADAR DETECTORS , DOES NOT DETECT LIDAR / LASER ! For quite some time now , this baby has helped me detect the evil California Highway Patrol 's stormtroopers out to drum up revenue up and down the gauntlet of the California highways . The CHP uses Ka band in the vast majority of their vehicles . This badboy will chirp like crazy a good two miles before you get to the chippie bum who 's out to get you ! It has saved me thousands already . It has alerted me to police as well . The Ka band is the most useful setting . X and regular K bands are usually grocery or liquor store or drug store security systems . Recently , on the way up to Fresno , my LASER setting chirped like crazy ! I told my wife , " we 're DEAD . " I was right . The CHP stormtrooper goon came down the onramp . $ 229 and a contested ticket later , I 'm not mad at the Beltronics unit . Laser cannot be be predicted . The only time you can " detect " it is after it has homed in on you and you 're caught . So I was indeed caught . What is important to note is that this unit is worthless against lidar , just like all other detectors . When you know it , it 's too late . Knowing that , I recommend buying this great little unit AND getting Veil Stealth anti-lidar / laser stealth coating for your vehicle . It will essentially jam the lidar units of the stormtroopers , uh , I mean , highway patrol , for up to 10 seconds giving you time to slow down . Your detector will then truly be able to warn you . Look into Veil Stealth . It 's around $ 90 and lasts for years . Read up on it and combine it with this Beltronics 995 . If you do , you are , in essence , temporarily invisible to the fuzz . Best of luck to all !  
1	  I was looking for a dual probe thermometer for my smoker . Had previously purchased a Maverick ET-7 and have been happy with it . But then I made the mistake of purchasing the ET-73 model . What piece of junk . The first issue is that the on off switch for the sensor unit is under the battery cover and you need a screw driver to open the cover . The " screw " the you turn is made of plastic and the tabs on it broke the first time I used it , rendering it useless . So I have to use a rubber band to keep the cove r closed ! Then the smoker probe went out and would only read HH . The programming over the unit is much more complicated than the older ET-7 unit and you can only raise the temperature setting , you can't go back down . So if you miss your temp setting , you have to go all the way to the top setting ( 400 ) to start over again . I rarely return items , but quickly boxed it up after day one for return . The next day I decided to take another look at it and see if I could work thru the issues . Maybe it was just me ? I reopened the unit inserted the batteries and put the probes in , at my kitchen table . One probe was reading HH and the otter 156 deg f . I 'm pretty sure that my house was not 156 degrees ! Back in the box and log on to Amazon for return instructions ! Don't waste your time with this unit , until they work out their issues . You will be disappointed .  
1	  I bought these earphones assuming they would be superior to the ones that came with my Iriver player . unfortunately , they sound like a tin can on a string with no depth of sound and little bass . Have to increase the volume much higher and they still sound awfull . The right and left phones are poorly marked and difficult to see which is which . A one star rating is too generous for this product but that 's as low as this review format allows .  
1	  I was going to wipe my computer and downgrade to XP so I decided to back up my music . I burned most of my music to Memorex CD-Rs and checked the first 3 or 4 to be sure things were burning properly . Nero said they were successfully burnt ! Later I was able to score a few DVDs so I didn't have to use so many CDs , THANKFULLY . Because after I wiped my computer and went to get my music back from the Memorex CD-Rs I couldn't ! Over half the discs were defective . The defective ones would only show the first folder on the disk and the other ones come up as " file not found " when I search for them in the Command line . These CDs are junk . This is not the first time that Memorex has screwed me but it is the last .  
1	  Do not buy this stuff It 's junk . I almost never write a review but I couldn't resist after using this junk . So , save your time & money  
2	  I don't know too much about this kind of equipment , but I have been using this on a weekly basis for the past 3 months and haven't had any problems .  
2	  Luckily , there have been no events to test the actual surge protection of this strip , so I really can't comment on that . I do , however , like the design . The right-angle plug is very convenient . Spacing of the outlets on top allow for bulky plugs , and the two side outlets are a plus . I would definitely purchase more .  
1	  I agree with the two previous reviewers . There needs to be a user manual and there isn't one . The fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees . This isn't very helpful for star gazing . The maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches . This is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing . Celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together .  
1	  Good day , Do not buy this model . We have expereinced nothing but problems and now the replacement bulbs are impossible to find . Do not waste your money .  
1	  Don't buy this . Whale garbage . Made of plastic not metal . Fan speed is slow . I purchsed one from ebay that is made of metal and the fan speed is stronger .  
1	  I have had a number of multi-brand remotes , some even cheaper than this one , and this is the worst . It suggests it can do much more than it can . Not only can it not program my VCR , it would not even allow me to change channels by entering the channel number . I had to go through each one . Control of my audio components was horrible . It would do some things , but not other more important ones . I tried all suggested codes for my devices , and went through the instructions exhaustively , but nothing helped . Also , there is no backlighting . This may work OK for some brands , but not for my major brand components . The only thing it worked well for was its own brand , Sony . You can do much better with practically any other cheap remote .  
1	  the sound on these is garbage . i enjoy bass in my music and being able to hit all ranges . however , the sound quality on these is extremely poor . if you like purely treble in your music they would not be a bad choice .  
1	  Randomly it stopped ejecting the DVD . Sometimes , if we leave a DVD in it , we are able to press " play " to make it register the DVD , and then it will eject to put in a new one . But most of the time we cannot use it except for VHS . We did nothing to the player to make it do this , so thats really annoying . Dont waste your money , it will break !  
2	  We purchase this Viewer to monitor who was in the front yard and aroung our Auto 's . It works good . It sends out a signal from the car port to the house which is about 60 feet .  
2	  It 's bigger and better than the one that I had before . What more could I ask for .  
2	  The ease of using the interface of this camera is beyond any other competitors . Almost all settings can be done with the dials , meaning to say that you don't have to sieve through tons of menus on the LCD to change a setting . The LCD is a big bonus as well . It really makes me wonder why Nikon and Canon can't do the same , it 's not technically challenging nor does it increase cost by much . Trust me , you 'll love the 7D once you compare it 's LCD to the puny ones that others offer . Battery life is adequate as well . Obviously the Anti-shake is an advantage , especially if you have shakey hands to begin with . But take note that it 's not a miracle cure , it REDUCES shake , but doesn't ALWAYS eliminate it . So at the end of the day , you still require rather steady hands . A few gripes . Firstly , there 's not much lens selection . You can't beat the likes of canon 's vast collection . But Minolta is rectifying that , so its not much of a problem . Second , focusing speed is not up to par with the canon 20D nor the nikon D70 . If you 're the kind who feels strongly about focusing speed , u might just get frustrated with this one . At the end of the day , minolta has designed one splendid camera , with a few shortcomings . But hey , nothing 's perfect .  
1	  One of the cars didn't work at all , but shipping too expensive to reurn . Disappointing christmas gift .  
2	  iPod family is all about style and usability . When you are buying this , you shouldn't focus too much on its capacity or price . If you are looking for big capacity or cheap price , there will be many others more suitable for you . * charge it fully , 4 + hrs , before use . otherwise a lot of problems will occur and you will be in gadget hell * the good : 1 . light and small , travel friendly . 2 . a perfect balance of capacity and price . why buy 20GB when you will never use that much ? that would be like buying 10 pairs of shoes when you will only wear one . ok , a lot of you do that , ladies . 3 . the headset is high quality , that 's not true for most other mp3 players . 4 . superb usability in hardware and software . 5 . can hold your word documents and can hold your vacation photos if you get one of those belkin brdige thing . the bad : 1 . MUST BE FULLY CHARGD FIRST . you have been warned , TWICE . 2 . not all that sturdy , it is made of hard drive , not flash memory , so it 's easily broken if you drop it a few times . Handle with care . i.e. don't take it to workout . 3 . less individuality since 1/2 of the population buy this , at least that 's what I read in the magazine . 4 . locks up when some users , I 'm not familiar with that , but it seems that it happens to a few of them , but it 's self-repairable . Got it when checking price on WhoSave , also a good list of superior products : $U$ recommend it to you if you enjoy the better things in life and capable of taking care of delicate objects . have fun  
2	  This is not the first time I have bought this product . Its reliability can only be surpassed by its high data transfer speed . Highly recommended for digital photography and digital photo frames .  
2	  This is my second Kodak camera , my old camera had only 3x Optical Zoom , but I was looking for bigger zoom , therefore , ( .. ) The Kodak DX6490 really surprised me on many fronts , with a 4-megapixel CCD , a high-quality Schneider-Kreuznach 10x optical zoom lens with much lower than average distortion , a capable autofocus system that works down to very low light levels , and an electronic viewfinder system that likewise works very well in dim lighting . Its exposure system spans a range of control from fully automatic to fully manual , and an external flash sync connector permits use with external flash units . According to me with the four-megapixel , 10x-zoom DX6490 though , Kodak takes a large step toward bringing their excellent color technology to the " enthusiast " market . Even in light of the large lens this is a compact camera , the DX6490 has an overall body design similar to a number of other long-zoom digicams on the market , with a generous handgrip on the right-hand side , balancing the large lens on the left . It definitely won't fit into your shirt pocket , but the DX6490 is small enough for larger coat pockets , purses , backpacks , etc . , and comes with a neck strap and rechargeable batter and dock .

1	  This is a scam-this charger did not work at all . Get the " Apple iPad 10W USB Power Adapter ( MC359LL / A ) " , they look identical but the 10W USB power adapter works , not the one that is described here .  
1	  Toshiba is " recalling " this DVD player due to poor HDMI performance . Visit their website : $U$ customer supportand then updates / notices . The SD-5960 will be in the pop up window .  
2	  I am a fan of Sansa players , as they frequently have expansion slots for microSD cards . It 's a cheap way to add more memory . Some of them are picky about brand , and seem to prefer SanDisk microSD . Conspiracy ? Sansa firmware can only use 2GB of flash , but rockbox ( see below ) is up to 8GB or 16GB ; I don't remember which . Bigger than any microSD I own , for sure . I am not entirely convinced by the ring-style interface . Still getting used to that . Other pro : large screen area given the size of the player . FM and ability to record from it . Built-in place to attach a lanyard . Tasteful design , obviously influenced by iPod . Don't have to use iTunes ! Yay ! Other cons : proprietary USB connector ( boo ! ) ; should be miniUSB . Back cover is screwed down ; don't know if the battery is replaceable . On my c2xx Sansa player there is a battery cover for easy accessibility . Sansa firmware is generally capable but v1 e2xx players will enter an entirely new level of functionality and customizability with rockbox ( rockbox dot org ) . You 'll be able to play flac , ogg , etc , and be able to play video without using that Sansa media conversion monstrosity . Truly useful multi-bookmarking features are a godsend for audiobook and podcasters that hop around instead of listening to one thing at a time . Almost like a tivo ; stop any file whereever you want and restart it later . Note : v1 players have firmware that starts out 01 . xx . The v2 players ( 03 . xx , oddly enough ) will also run rockbox but that version isn't 100 % yet .  
2	  Littly pricy , but a great cable . You will plug this in and never get another , so why not get it ? You may want a longer one though , I just use this from my cable modem to my router .  
2	  I bought my iPod Shuffle almost 2 months ago and have no regrets . Before Shuffle , I had no intentions of buying an iPod but one day my floppy drive on my laptop broke and decided to buy a pen drive instead . While searching for one , I decided I wanted a pendrive integrated with mp3 player . I was about to buy the one from Sandisk until I learned it needed a cable to connect to the USB port . I don't want to carry a cable in my bag everyday ! So , I decided I 'd rather use iTunes than carry a cable . :) At first , I didn't like the idea of not having an LCD display nor FM tuner . I was thinking if I could get used to not having those features and realized I hate the LCD light in my Sony CD player because it is too bright ( I listen to music before I sleep ) and it consumes too much battery . Also , I never listen to the FM . Then , why did I want those in the mp3 player ? Because others have it , therefore I couldn't imagine one without it . I must confess , I chose it also because of its simple design . I don't own any other products by Apple , but I always loved their minimalistic design . Am I shallow ? Probably , but I 'm happy with it . I had never used iTunes before buying Souffl & eacute ; ( I named it that way , hehe ) but it is very easy to use and so far I had no problems with it . I can live without it , but life is easier with it because I use it everywhere and it is more practical than carrying a floppy disk . Then why 4 stars ? Because I wish it included a pouch to protect it from dirt and maybe it will prevent the earphone cords from tangling . I recommended it mostly to students and athletes .  
2	  B + W or the highest level Hoya filters are on dozens of our lenses . Except for super wide angles that don't have actual threads you 'd by foolish not to add the very best UV filters you can buy . These are certainly in that category . They 've saved many a front element over the years . Prior to digital I always used Skylights but now UVs are the only option . To paraphrase a common shoe brand : just do it .  
1	  The Adesso tablet requirements say Mac OSX but the one I just bought for my daughter only works with a FOUR YEAR OLD operating system - OS9 . The fine print in the manual ( after you bought the thing ) says check the site for new driver info . When you go to the site it tells you FILE NOT FOUND . Beware this SCAM !  
1	  We purchased two of these for data backups , the first we opened was bad right out of the package . The second drive seemed to work fine for backups until we tried to copy the data from it back to the computer . The drive got really hot and then disappeared from my computerThats when we found out that the controller was bad . When I called verbatim about it , they apologized and gave me the name of a company that for 2700 dollars could get my data back . Don't buy this drive , get the SanDisk , OCZ or the Kingston . I have several of those drives and never had a problem .  
2	  The moon is very bright when viewing thru my C8-SGT scope . I find this filter an absolute requirement for prolong studing of the moon and looking at details . I use this filter on both my stratus , Meade 5000 , and Expl . Sc . EP . Works great !  
2	  Aside from what others say , this is not the Tiffen Wallet . It might have been at one time , but not now . The pictures are deceiving , and actuallyshow two wallets . The first two are of the Tiffen , black with mesh pockets . The second wallet is a red vinyl pouch with plastic pockets . That is what I received . All in all though , it is a good wallet . It seems well made , and well padded . I was concerned about the plastic pockets because I have big handsand usually can't get my fingers into these things to get filters out without getting finger prints all over them . This was not the case . The plastic is soft , and I can't see it getting hard over time and splitting like some do . They were big enough to hold 77mm filters so I could get them out without anytrouble . I 'd say it 's a good wallet for the price , but for those that think they 're going to get a cheap deal on the Tiffen wallet .. think again !  
2	  I did a review after I first set it up and ran several photos through . Now I have run two sets of color cartridges and 2-1/2 rolls of 4 " photo paper and several greetings cards through it and I am even more impressed . PRINT QUALITY EQUIVALENT TO SILVER HALIDE BUT LIFE MAY NOT : As I said in my earlier review a professional photo-evaluator , had recommended this printer to me , as its print quality looks almost like a silver halide print . One concern however , is storage . It is my understanding ink-jet prints though they may look equivalent to that of silver halide , do not have the life span . Only time will tell . EASY TO USE I make my living evaluating items for ease of use and this printer impressed me . One concern I had when I first realized you had to change some of the parts of the printer for 4 " roll paper was ease of doing this , as it was placed up on a shelf and not easy for me to access . I was pleasantly surprised . PAPER LOADING THOUGH AT FIRST IS CONFUSING GOES TOGETHER NICE : The Epson printer has a two-piece assembly for the back paper-loading section . One part is made to accept two different assemblies . One for sheet paper , and the other for roll paper . Once you first install this piece , it goes in easy . Initially it was a little confusing from the instructions . However , since you have to change part of this to put in the paper roll , I had a chance to do this at least 10 times . I 'm happy to say , loading the paper on the roll and dropping this into the back of the printer is easy to do . Given where I put my printer this could have been a nightmare . The printer once the roll paper is placed here and placed toward the back of the printer virtually self loads . The book does a nice job telling you how to setup the " film factory " software to maximize this usage as well . The 4 " roll paper once done can be advanced to cut and then put back in loaded position or in position to remove from the printer . All it takes is one button push for each and the printer does the work . INK CHANGE MID-PRINTING : This was amazing . My ink ran out right in the middle of a large print run for photos on the 4 " wide roll paper . I anticipated wasted paper or a need to prematurely change the ink . Luckily Epson thought this all out for me . Once the ink was exhausted the printing stopped and cued up the ink cartridge . It also gave me plenty of warning if I had no cartridge on hand . Each print I did , I was shown the status of the ink cartridges . When it ran out , it stopped nicely after a print and told me it could go no further . At that time I could advance the picture to cut if I wanted to and then requeue the paper . It offered me instructions ( which I used ) to change the cartridge and nicely showed me each step , including removing the strip that protects the contacts . Once the cartridge was changed it resumed the printing job . Ironically , once this happened when I could not attend to it , and it patiently waited for over 8 hours for me and then went like clockwork when done . EASE OF FINDING INK-JET CARTRIDGES AND EPSON PAPER Needless to say , once you get the printer , you will need to purchase replacement cartridges . I 'm finding it easier to find the cartridges online . However , I 'm sure speciality stores would have these cartridges , but they are not in grocery stores like some of the HPs and Canon 's are . As far as the paper , I 'm also not finding it as plentiful in the real world as online . Online is amazingly cheaper as well , even considering shipping . Key is buying enough at one time . FOR BEST QUALITY USE EPSON PAPER : It makes a major difference when you use Epson paper with this printer . If you want the best quality , this is what you should do . This is not saying other papers won't work , but the results may be unexpected . On one of the other competitor 's paper , I tried , I got an iridescent 3D effect , when I tried it . Not good . P.S. This review was before I had used Kodak 's One Touch to better Pictures . Please see my Kodak Paper review prior to making your buying decision . I was really impressed with what Kodak did . COMPARISON : I have owned a Lexmark , Brother and HP printers and have never been so impressed at the quality of the product as I have been with this printer . The external construction is solid , the initial use was seamless and its end product is exceptional . Nice job !  
1	  The case looked nice and distinguished . I was happy as I took it out of the box and mounted my m100 .. I closed the snap . Then I opened the snap , and it broke . Tore right out . * sigh * Return Authorization , please .  
1	  Purchased this LCD TV , and within three days decided to return it . Thank you , Amazon ! LCD resolution , color , and sharpness leave a lot to be desired . Funai doesn't state the pixel count , but it appears to be 640 x 480 . The TV is simple to adjust and operate ; however , in spite of all my attempts to get a good picture over digital cable , the TV just didn't deliver . My smaller Toshiba CRT delivers a much sharper , brighter , and better contrast picture than this Funai . The Funai is stylish and weighs little . The remote is somewhat sparse and utilitarian . It does have all the necessary connections . It is entirely cheap plastic with somewhat sharp edges . Although it is supposedly tiltable , I was not able to get it to tilt . Perhaps if I had an HD box , the picture would be satisfactory . Price point is good , but for just a little more money there are much better sets to be had .  
1	  This is the second CANON digital camera that has failed , one after 2-years of use , the other after only 10mo use . The first camera was out-of-warranty so no repair was attempted . The second camera , an SD800 , failed while still under " warranty " . CANON refused warranty service due to moisture damage found in the camera . The camera had seen significant use but was never exposed to significant moisture , e.g. , it was never dropped in or splashed with liquid . In the real world it could easily have experienced a few drops of moisture . As a retired engineer it is my opinion that these CANON cameras are not designed to stand-up to the rigors of the real world . They work well out of the box but are not robust enough to provide service for anywhere near as long as numerous film cameras I have used for decades with no significant problems . I will move on to another brand in hopes of finding a more real world ready digital camera , one that is designed to resist damage from a few drops of moisture .  
2	  ok so heres the deal , i was very skeptical about buying a scratch remover for my ipod video so i did more research . i came across many different kinds promising the same thing but in the end it was IDROPS that stood out . i rad an online review about it and it claimed it to not be so good . HOWEVER that one review was outmatched by the other 200 i came across all claiming that this product atually worked . i was caught and had to try this stuff and the price is not bad at all so i bought it . it came in very nicely packaged and i was very excited to finally try it and to my amazement it did wonders for my ipod . it had some deep scratches on the click wheel and i used the idrops after about an hour of rubbing and buffing the scratches were almost gone and since i have been using the scratches are gone . this product is amazing it just depends on how you apply it and what you use to remove the scratches heres what i did try having someone on the side to apply the drops : 1 . apply four drops to the face of the ipod2 . rub with a microfiber cloth for about 15 to 25 seconds3 . apply more drops and repeat4 . after about 4 or five applications your cloth will be pretty soaked with the solution so you can apply about 2 drops in the cycle . keep doing this until you get the desired resultsa tip is to rub across the scratch but if you have light scratches it really doesnt matter you should do the across movement on the deep ones and try not to apply so much pressure do it once in a while during the rubbingalltogether this product is AMAZING ! give it a chance and play with it youll become a scratch remover pro in no time :)  
2	  I 've used these Tripp Lite Snagless cables on many installations with great success . Certainly a much better approach than making them up yourself .  
1	  i am an avid amateur photographer for 20 + years . i used this purchase as a test of " economical " filters . i have B & W on all of my other lenses , but for 7.99 i decided to jump in the boat with all those who say the filter is for mainly protection and does little to help your pics . i used this on the new s 17-50 tamron , which i like for what it does . i now have B & W on this lens , and in my opinion it lifts a veil . even if not , the pleasure of screwing that german filter ( so well machined ) onto your lens , and realizing that you will probably NEVER have to clean that lens is very reassuring , and worth the price . i have returned the tiffen to Amazon , my fav online . associated equipment : 30d , 2.8 70-200 IS ( phenomenal ) , 24-105 IS , 1.4 50 , 1.8 85 , 580II . all of this equipment seems to work well , but the L lenses are magical , and the others serve their purposes nicely , but aren't as consistent in giving great fast shots .  
1	  This is a terrible keyboard . I have always used Microsoft keyboards in the past , but this one is not typical of their normally great design . The space bar is very stiff and it hasn't gotten any better after 4 months of use . I am throwing it out and buying a competitors product .  
1	  Thing is a piece of junk . Plastic earpiece kept on falling off . I had to put it back on until it finally didn't stay on any longer . Called company and rude supervisor said they would give me another one only because it was under warrantee but I would have to pay shipping and send in money order for more than the thing costs on amazon . Waste of money . Do no t buy in my opinion .  
2	  I bought this hand crank / solar powered radio about 3 years ago and use it about 3 times a week ( mostly to shower by ) . The sound is good and I can listen to between 20-35 minutes of music on about 100 continuous turns of the crank . It also recharges when left in direct sunlight-though I prefer to crank it as my bathroom doesn't get direct sunlight . It 's guilt free radio , too , because it uses no electricity !  
2	  Got this for a TiVo . I had a wireless B connector and wanted to switch to a cable connection . Hooked it up and it worked without any issues . Good price and simple setup . Now , I guess I 'll have some time to watch a few more commercials ..  
2	  This cable was cheap and functional , but it proved unreliable . When I used it to attach my GPS to the iMac , the computer kept thinking the device had been disconnected and giving me the warning not to disconnect without ejecting . When I replaced it with one by GE ( also very cheap ) , the problem went away .  
1	  Although , I reviewed this product before purchase and I knew it would be sloow , it is really very very slow and fails to connect most of the time . You are required to install software on each system that needs access . On the two systems that I have installed the software on have had nothing but problems since . Worst yet the hard drive that you install in the box is rendered useless be used again in any other type of system . Look elsewhere for a NAS .  
2	  I paired this sub with the yamaha 6490'sThis sub is deep defined and natural sounding . In my opinion it is the best sounding sub at this price point . I simply dont agree with the folks that rate this as a home theater only sub . I listen to an ecceltic mix of music and i particularly appreciate the accuracy and realism when i play jazz . I could go on and on as this sub amazes me everytime i listen to it . Oh yeah .. jayzee and fity rock on this thing ! If you 're looking for a very versital , musical sub at a ridiculasly modest price , get this ! Oh , its very well built and attractive too .  
1	  IT WAS LABELED FOR COBRA , not escort ! I purchased this with a COBRA xrs 9770g . They both arrived together . It does NOT FIT the slot on the unit , its much wider . I did take a dremel and cut the metal bands down and forced it in , and it really does not lock in place right , but I already damaged it . DONT ORDER FOR COBRA 9770G and possibly , from other reviews it does not fit other COBRA detectors either . CALL and confirm from someone that it fits your model cobra . THIS IS probably for older models ? WHY does AMAZON not state WHAT COBRA models this fits ? Others returned it , I cut it with a dremel and forced it to fit , and its not perfect . Oh , by the way , its a clip worth about a dollar , and I paid about $ 10 for it !  
1	  Like many others , I had a broken microscope and required the assistance of customer service to help trouble shoot . They only allow communication through email .

2	  I bought one of these to replace a Gateway Notebook that died after 10 days of use . The good : Bang for the buck Apple , OS X , Handsome styling , Slot loading CD / DVD drive ( No tray to worry about breaking ) , Top notch Apple support , Software does what the box says it will do , Ample features for a student , or road warrior , and best of all It 's not a Gateway ! Games play well on this machine , but it 's primary design is to be a compact , simple to use computer for on the road or at school . There are no external hinges or buttons to get hung inside of a backpack . One reviewer complained about the " Paint peeling off the outside of the computer " I don't see how this is possible because there is no paint on this machine . The White color you see is IN the plastic that is the computer shell . Update * 6-17-06People that are new to Apple products needs to understand that Apple has replaced the G4 chip , and switched to Intel . The G4 ibooks on show room floors are the last of this awesome and reliable chip . If you find one for a good price , better act fast because when its gone , its gone for good . The only Apple computer that still uses the G series PowerPC chip is the Power Mac G5 ( Very Expensive ) .  
1	  HD-515 is an entry-level headphone to 500 series . It however fails its promise . the sound quality ( especially the base is nasal ) is not good over all . Being a 500 it has a design that makes it comfortable but the question you ask is that why is it so big in the first place ? Even though I had reviews on it I 'm of the opinion that for the less price you could get more or less the same quality . However hd-515 's sisters are very different on the matters of quality . I do recommend buying one of its sisters hd-555 or hd-595 , instead . If those are too expensive I would suggest buying hd-280 pro for just a little more . Note that when you 're reading reviews on headphones it is subjective for a great part . I will have to explain what my taste is before giving a review to hd-515 . I like my headphones to be comfortable using it for hours in a row . 500 series have a good way of offering a design that assures a high level of comfort . I also wanted noise cancellation in the beginning when I bought my hd-280 pro . It doesn't really have noise cancellation but it is a sealed headphone . It means that blocks noise in virtue of sealing the area around your ears . I have found out ( I might be wrong but in my experience ) that noise cancellation works best for people around you and not you . It is not the case that just by putting one the headphones the noises inside would block all the noises outside - but that in high volumes you are surely to hear just your own sound ( not your heart beat or your breathing but the sound generated by the headphone . Sealed headphones generally do the same thing ( just put cups or your hands around your ears and you wouldn't hear sounds outside as well ! ) . However that all comes at a cost . Sealed headphones are generally speaking lower in quality . Noise blocking works best for non-listeners unless the volume level is high . So if people around you have no problem with buzz sound of your music ( " privacy " they call it ) then go for open headphones . I wouldn't want to buy something that blocks the sound for the convenience of others ! So I would buy open headphones and get advantage of better sound quality . Yet open does not mean that you can hear everything outside your cans and doesn't mean others could sit around you and listen ! My first headphones were sennheiser hd-280 pro a sealed headphones that are not very uncomfortable . I traded in because they weren't comfortable ( and for mysterious reasons my ears were hurting ) . I didn't get a chance to burn the headphones and sold it as soon as I could - headphones are like cars . You need to use it for a while to get a good sound and break it in so to speak . So don't be too disappointed in the beginning . I sold those headphones to my neighbor and he couldn't be happier . As I have said it is very subjective why some people like their headphones . I know that he is a gamer and his last headphone was broken . Other than that he has no preference on the comfortableness of the headphones . He had worn those for hours without any discomfort . Currently I have put an order for HD 595 . I will write a very short review once I receive it .  
1	  I received a pair of Audio Technica ( " A-T " ) ATH-ANC7 Active Noise Cancellingheadphones as a gift for Christmas 2008 . I didn't like them , so I soldthem and bought a pair of Bose QC-2 's . This review compares anddiscusses them both . Here is how I rated them . The scale I use is : Poor , Fair , Good , Very Good , Excellent . Noise ReductionBack in the late 80 's and early 90 's I rode a motorcycle and would wear foamearplugs often . Those earplugs reduce noise very well , like putting yourfingers tightly in your ears . They are a little less effective with lowerfrequencies because they are transmitted more readily throughyour skull bones . I was somewhat disappointed to discover that over - or on-the-ear noisecancelling headphones do not reduce noise as well as a $ 2 foam plug . Thatsaid , the noise reduction on these devices is adequate , and there are reasonsto consider them : 1 ) They 're easier to put on and take off at will , 2 ) Theyreduce external noise without affecting your ability to listen to music , 3 ) They won't get the inside of your ear dirty , 4 ) Many people find earplugsto be uncomfortable . So I tested both headsets on the highway in our old Toyota . I was surprisedto see how well they reduced the low-midrange road noise . In a side-by-sidecomparison , I found the noise reduction to be quite similar , however , theQC-2 's had a subtle " sea shell " effect ( try cupping your hand over your ear ) , where I actually could hear a faint echoy-ness to the external sounds . It wasquite subtle but to me it was there . The A-T 's beat the Bose by a whisper . Noise Reduction Score : ATH-ANC7 : Very Good . QC-2 : Good . SoundSome writers on Amazon have claimed that the QC-2 's bass is superior to theATH-ANC7 's , or that the ATH-ANC7 has greater clarity or whatnot . I conductedan extended listening test of the two headphones ( making sure that they wereat equivalent volumes ) , and could not tell the difference . Perhaps othershave more refined hearing than I , but to me they simply sounded identical . Sound Score : ATH-ANC7 : Very Good . QC-2 : Very Good . FitWhy , Audio-Technica ? You did such a great job on other aspects of yourheadphones , but regarding fit you really blew it . This was the dealbreaker forme with respect to the ATH-ANC7 's . I could not wear them after 20 minutesbecause they were so uncomfortable . I swear , A-T really frustratesme on this point . Here are the problems : The headphone is designed to be around-the-ear , howeverit did not fit mine . Also , though the earcups rotate back 90 degrees sothey lie flat in their carrying case , they rotate the other way only 5 or 10degrees . To get proper fit I had to flip the headphones around . Finally , whenthe headphone is on my head the inside speaker part rests against my externalear . Maybe it 's just me , but these are all things that Bose got right so I know I'mnot the only one . The earcups fit totally around my ears . You can swivelthem forward 30 degrees or so to fit your head . And when you look at theinside of the earcup , you can see that the driver is set deep and angled toavoid resting on your ear . All it took was proper engineering . I can wear the QC-2 's as long as I want . No uncomfortable pressure points . That A-T missed such an easy and important mark is inexcusable in myopinion . Fit Score : ATH-ANC7 : Ridiculously lousy . QC-2 : Very Good . Finish ( or quality ) I know others here have claimed that the QC-2 is flimsy or whatnot , but I don'tsee it . I see little to no difference in quality between the two brands . Theyuse plastic , metal , glue , and screws in all the right places . The headphonesneed to be lightweight , right ? ' Nuff said . I have to say that the finish for both is good . So , Finish Score : ATH-ANC7 : Good . QC-2 : Good . PriceAs you know , the total of the ATH-ANC7 will be about $ 100 . For the Bose , about $ 300 . What are you getting for your extra $ 200 ? I don't know . If youcan't afford 300 bucks for a headphone , you may react to the QC-2 in the sameway that I reacted to the fit of the ATH-ANC7 . Price Score : ATH-ANC7 : Good . QC-2 : PoorShopping ExperiencePurchasing a headphone is not the same as just picking up an iPod or othermusic player . It 's a piece of audio equipment that you wear , so you need tobe happy with the fit as well as the function . Thus it 's important toensure that the vendor has a liberal return policy . We did not . :-( In the case of Electronics Expo ( Amazon 's seller for the ATH-ANC7 ) , they havea 20 % restocking fee . A quick review on eBay shows that people are regularlyselling open box ATH-ANC7s for more than you get on a return . So you 'd bebetter off selling it there than returning it , which makes their return policyrather useless . Meanwhile , Bose offers a 30-day full refund . I didn't use it , so I can'tcomment . Shopping Score : ATH-ANC7 : Caveat emptor . QC-2 : Caveat Emptor here , too-why not ? OverallIn total , I have to give the ATH-ANC7 a " Poor " . The Bose QC-2 gets a " Very Good " . Sorry , Audio Technica . You need to get the basics right . A bargain is nobargain if the thing goesn't work for you . So I 'm going to give theseheadphones only 2 stars . That said , if you can pick them up and try themrisk-free - go for it ! If you 're happy with them then good on ya ! You'llbe $ 200 happier than I.  
1	  It 's simple . The fan is loud . It gets louder . I call . They say , " Sure we 'll replace it for a $ 30 fee ( oh , and you have to front the cost of another card since we don't trust you to mail the old one back on your own dime ) . " Thanks guys . I 'll remember to tell my friends about you .  
2	  The only thing that is missing in an automatic feeder . I had some old slides that I scanned and they came out beautiful . Old faded memories came to light again . I had an HP before but I won't go back . Cannon is better all the way around .  
1	  This product was ordered and had to returned it twice and finally had to cancel the order and ask for a refund .  
1	  Immediately the headset did not work . Just a bunch of static , should have listened to the other reviews . Had to purchase another headset .  
1	  Boosted signal enough for my application , but not as much as the product advertisement claimed . Signal still reading very low to low in other other rooms in house .  
1	  I recently bought this product and returned almost immediately after I find out that D-LINK implementation of the RAID was very unreliable . This unit would it being great if you can start with 1 drive and set is as RAID enable so in the future you can buy another drive switch to Raid 1 and the device automatically knows to reformat ONLY the new drive and start mirroring with drive 1 . Instead the device only let you run single drive configuration while you had only one drive and if you want to add another drive in the future as Raid 1 it will reformat the old drive so you will lost all your data unless you backup first . Most people buy this device as storage because they don't have more space on their desktop PC so it make no sense to force the user to backup what they had stored on Drive 1 because they won't have were to put it . If you don't care about RAID configuration then the device may work for you , because you will be running 1 or 2 drives independently on single drive configuration . However be aware that every time you upgrade your firmware the device warns you that you should backup your data because it will reformat the drives , what in the world D-Link was thinking ? The device format your drives using Linux Ext2 file system so you are not comfortable with this avoid this device . There are free drivers on the internet to allow Windows to mount Ext2 drives so if something happened with the Device you can recover your data from windows , but so far these drivers don't work under Windows Vista and are not recommended computer users that are not familiar with File systems or Partitions .  
2	  I purchased the TEAC 5.1 to replace a 20 year old Harmon / Kardon stereo receiver used in my den , so I do not use its video features but am more than pleased with its audio capabilities . The Pro Logic and surround sound settings do , indeed , surround and fill the room with rich full sound reproduction , whether from CD , phono , or FM stereo source . There are many options available as to speaker set up ( A-B ) , DTS , or the 5.1 . The remote is full function and works well from any angle . Controls are easy to use , well marked , and readily accessable . Screen display is clear and very readable . While it may not have as many bells and whistles as some newer 7.1 receivers , it more than fulfills my expectations and needs . The gold on black labeling looks great too !  
2	  I use this on my husband 's back every night . It really keeps him loose and lessens his leg pain . As we get older , we need something like this to keep us going .  
1	  I agree wiht the other review . The delay is ridculous . When I take a picture of my 18 month old twins and I press the button they are doing something cute . By the time the picture takes at least one baby is not even in the picture anymore .  
2	  If you 've read any of my other reviews , you will have noted that a bulk of my writing is done through voice recognition software because of CTS , almost making the keyboard obsolete . Because the amount of actual typing I do is so small it 's difficult to give a thorough evaluation . The first thing that comes to mind though is ; with these split keyboards , you must know how to type , or it will drive you crazy . My wife spends a great deal of time on the keyboard at work , actually has a model almost identical to this one and claims to " love it " . She can also type some insane amount of words per minute , so I lend her much credibility in this area . She can type , have a conversation with you , and eat breakfast , simultaneously ! She gives it five stars , and I concur .  
2	  The Hoya filter was ordered along with a Nikon D60 as protection for the 18-55 kit lens . It appears to be perfectly clear with a precision fit .  
1	  I lost my Sony MDR NC5 after having it for 15 months . I found this model on the web with good reviews about it . I thought I would give it a try . Sound quality was not as good as the Sony . But hey , it was cheaper . I could not complain . However , after using it for only 2 months , the plastic wire covering started tearing off at the bottom of both ear pieces , exposing the wire . I have been very careful not to pull the wire because I need the headphone on the noisy bus every weekday . Two more months later it stopped working . I am going back to Sony .  
2	  Love this IRiver H10 . It looks great , the battery is long-lasting and the product is pretty easy to use . Just upload your music onto it - no need to change format or use ITunes - it just takes the MP3 files from your computer . You can also upload your playlists . Takes a little time to get used to if you 're more familiar with IPod , but once you play around with it , you 'll be sold .  
1	  Had a chance to compare the new " in-ear speakers " and let me tell you , they are a complete waste of money . First off , any in-ear headphone will sound worse than those that sit over the ear . These leave no room for the sound to reverberate , and can lead to hearing loss . With the sound bouncing , much of the finer qualities can become muffled and lose meaning . There is no reason to buy these , when many comparable substitutes can be found . Plus , by buying these , you are supporting a company that bullies small businesses . Stick with a nice pair of cans from Sony , or Bose if you want to spend a ton of cash . Stick with a manufacturer that has been in the business for years , not one that uses celebrity branding to overcome shortfalls .  
1	  HP 935 not worth it . Please read . Despite all of the many , many flaws of this 5.3 mega pixel camera , it still serves a purpose . If you are seriously considering this camera - please read on , and be careful how you spend your money ! ~ THE BAD ~ - Very slow in many respects ! - Very slow read and write times to / from the memory card . - Slow at taking pictures . - Very slow on start-up . - Not very accurate colour reproduction on professionally printed prints . - Colour tones seem muted or slightly washed out - Battery life very low . Way below average . - 7x digital zoom awful . You can't tell what you 're taking a picture of ; it 's so small on the screen . - 5.3 megapixels does not make more detailed pictures . Only larger ones . For more detail , go with interlaced digicams . - Flash effective for only half the distance it should be for . - Software glitches - CCD is obvously low quality : too much " noise " in pictures . ~ THE GOOD ~ - 5.3 megapixels make for huge pictures . If you need them . - Pentax lens . - Lots of picture-taking options . ~ THE STORY ~ one of my buddies has a Sony 3.2 mp camera which takes far superior pictures in almost every respect . The colours are more vivid and more accurate . The 5.3 mp of the HP 935 only makes a larger picture , because , once you 've reached " Photograph Quality " prints , you can't get any clearer unless you buy an interlaced digital camera . We both had our pictures printed at the same professional photo booth . The result ? All of our pals who saw our pictures agree that hers are better . And , sadly , I would have to agree as well . ~ OTHER CAMERAS ~ This is a sub-par camera not to be taken seriously . Even 3.2 megapixel Sony cameras take way better pictures than this HP.I suspect that you 'll get even better results with a modern 2.0 or 2.1 mp camera , by almost any other company . Consider anything BUT this camera , unless you enjoy wasting money . * ~ THE END ~ Overall - HP has a long way to go before they 'll be taken seriously in the camera world . Given the chance again , I would not buy this camera . Image quality is sub-par . Colour is sub-accurate . Price is too steep for what it is . If this camera cost $ 200 ( Canadian ) it would be fantastic . Because that 's what it should be worth . Bottom line is : This is a joke of a camera .  
1	  I purchased this for my son , he loved it . We didn't use it often , just when we traveled . We had it 1 year and 1 month when it died . The screen wouldn't come on anymore , however the buttons lit up , but then it would not power off , we had to remove the battery . If I had known this item would not have a long life , I would have spent a little more and got a better device .  
1	  I bought this as a Christmas present . It will NOT stay together . The laptop pad comes apart from the stand every time you move . I wish I had saved my receipt . I would demand a refund .  
1	  This is the most outrageous piece of garbage one can own , so please stand in line . I purchased this " device " as a replacement for super cheap memorex dvdr ( which was like $ 30 ) . Now Philips let me buy their product for $ 100-plus , you see , for Philips that 's like a Ferrari . For just over a hundred smakers I was previleged to the most sadomazochistic experience in the world . This piece of garbage has the best of the 1960s technologies in one convenient package . Here we have a CPU from the first Moon lander , a monochromatic display from the first Startrack ( r ) , the colling from the manufacturer of the commercial Marten owens and ability to not recognize any music or video format in existence in the world today . It is quite likely that the Philips workers in the finest slums of Zimbabwe worked hard and long to write a software that would fit all non-human forms out there in the universe , unfortunately , I happen to be a human , therefore my English skills and my BA were deemed irrelevant at this point . The Box ( as I cannot call it a DVDR ) has ability to not start and not turn off , not to play , not to search ot lable the titles , not to reproduce alternative angles , mentioned on played DVD disk . It can record with quality well below anything the Soviet VCR tape could offer . The " remote control " thing is a very intriguing novelty and can be a topic for hours of conversation with your friends at the parties , it however can not remotely operate a Philips box . The Progressive Scan feature is a very neat little thing - actually , if one would plug a progressive scan cable and attach it to a progressive scan TV , one will be gifted with a delight of low quality grainy picture . Also it would be impossible move to a regular TVset without first going into what Philips called Menu and resetting output back to regular . If not - you will have all outputs produce finest of black lines . I have left my review of this product at Philips web site as well and offered Philips to go out business , so the smarter businessmen from let 's say North Korea could take over the market share .  
1	  This is the first time I purchased a product by Tiffen . I 'm using this UV Protection filter mainly for the protection of my new lens , and I assume most people purchase a UV filter for the same reason . The main drive for me to choose this product is because of the reduced price and the 10-year warranty . Being a simple UV filter , there aren't any extra effects except the advertised " Helps eliminate bluish cast in images . " My prints just came back , and I can't really see too much of a difference with my untrained eyes .  
2	  Sennheiser headphones are simply the best . I bought this model HD-555 for my wife . She 's happy with this set . I do own Sennheiser HD 590 ( I 'm rating these 5 of 5 stars ) . We both noticed that my HD 590 feels softer on our ears ( less pressure ) . Maybe the pressure will change in future , but now I would rate them 4.5 stars because of the preasure . Both of these models have identical sound . I tested these headphones with song by Craig Armstrong - This Love , which has lowest bass sound I ever heard in song . Both headphones played low and high sound exellent . I do highly recommend this headset for home listening . It 's open system , the sound is going nicely out so you can listen these for long time without any troubles .  
2	  This is one of the best laptops on the market . The old canard that it 's more expensive than equivalent Windows laptops just isn't true . You have to dig into the specs of this thing to really make a comparison . But that 's irrelevant , let 's talk about the laptop itself . The good * Very nice graphics . When plugged in you get nice HD video from an AMD 6490M ( when you 're plugged in ) or from an Intel 3000HD when on battery . * Multi touch ( well almost ) trackpad . It 's missing a couple of things from the huge Magic Trackpad from Apple , but it has everything I can use . I can really maneuver around the computer with my trackpad . * Brilliant screen , 1440X900 , absolutely HD . * OSX 10.7 Lion . Really the best OSX by far , and amazing what it can do . * Speedy quad-core i7 processor . My massive Excel spreadsheets recalc fast . And working with Photoshop and Aperture show no issues whatsoever . This laptop really can be considered a mobile desktop . * Beautiful aluminum case . Just makes it feel expensive . ( One note , aluminum does bend easily , so if you 're rough with your computer , get one of those protective skins . ) * Nice built-in camera for video chatting , Skype or other things . * Easy to upgrade to 8GB memory . And you can get it for a lot less than Apple charges . Not so good * I 'm not a big fan of the speakers . They don't put out very much sound , even at full blast . It 's kind of hard to watch movies without a headset . * The hard drive is light for the price . Amazon sells 1TB 2.5 " hard drives for a good price , but upgrading the hard drive takes some skill to do it right . Overall , I am very happy with the laptop . I use it for everything from basic web browsing to photo editing to business work . I have had a lot of MacBooks , so I guess I 'm not only used to them , I know how to get the most of them . This one is a great one .  
1	  After having read the specifications and looked at the pictures , the cables that I purchased were not the same as specified . This makes a HUGE difference when one is working on servers and doesn't have the luxury of spending 5 minutes dealing with the stupid ' cup protector ' ends : [ .. ] . Also , when I reviewed my order , I had specified " 7 foot " cables . It said that the cables were 7 foot , but somehow between that and my confirming , I got an email saying they were 14 feet and I received 14 foot cables . Thanks .  
2	  this mouse has been improved on every parts from MX1000 except one , the surface of the mouse make you fell very sticky if you have sweaty hands like me .  
2	  I love my Street Pilot 2720 . I work in Law Enforcement . The cruiser that is assigned to me don't have much . Instead of using the bean bag holder I fashion with velcro sticky back tape to my two cars plus my Cruiser . I use it 5 days a week to check on about 10 to 20 houses daily . Plus locating abandon vehicles . I just type in the address and the street pilot does the rest . Before then I have to look in the the street map I haven't missed an address since thanks to street pilot 2720 .  
1	  This item produces a pleasant effect and adds very nice lighting to the party . It has good sound sensitivity . However , the cons outweigh : 1 . Duty cycle 10 min means you need to buy two and also automatic timer-switches for the outlets . That triples the cost at least . 2 . The damned thing heats like an iron - it is not safe , if within reach , especially if kids are around . 3 . It is 600W - probably more power than all your house lighting together . Count in the energy cost . 4 . The power cord is very short ( 3 ft ? ) , and there 's no on / off switch . So you will likely need extension cords with a switch too - or unplug the unit every time to switch it off . 5 . It is bulky : this mushroom is about 18 " tall and 12 " in diameter . After some research , I 've found there are many LED or laser lighting options under $ 100 , which are under 10W power consumption , have no duty cycle requirements , won't burn you . Chauvet min lasers will even fit in your pocket . So , from my point of view , this is an antiquated product .  
1	  You need plenty of light to use this camera to get even ok photos . I can't use this in half of my house because the photos come out to dark . the optinal flash gives everything a yellowish tint and takes forever to load . I use it to take pics of my toddler but by the time the pic is taken he has moved . its not very quick . I also noticed some sellers were selling it for $ 199 . That seems extreme to me the average price is $ 120 . I got it on sale for $ 80 and even that was to much . you can get a camera for around the same price with more megapixels save your money on this one  
2	  Apple 's iMac G5 's velocity engine will be able to speed up games so that a high end graphics card simply isn't necessary . This 128 bit floating point unit will complement the graphics card in gaming logic . When the iMac G5 was announced , some critics were disappointed that it didn't contain a TV tuner . Well , you can connect your iMac G5 to a firewire enabled cable or satellite box to view and control standard and HD resolution TV using the free multimedia player called VLC . Search " HDTV MacOSX " on Google . I would suggest that any purchaser order the bluetooth option since this will allow you to use your cellphone as a remote control . This will be very useful if you have your iMac G5 wall mounted . For wall mounted iMac G5 's , you should look into a program called Envision that displays artwork from the web full screen $U$ Might as well get the Airport card too . You know you are going to want to stream your music to your stereo system ! I 'm a computer consultant in New York City . Most of my time is spent removing viruses on Windows systems .  
1	  I bought it without doing much research . The filter isn't coated , so all of the wonderful coatings on your lens become almost pointless . I 've since decided to go without filters for protection . I replace the lens cap immediately after use anyway .  
1	  I have been a dedicated Pentax shooter for over 30 years , using Pentax equipment for all my 35mm , 645 and 6X7 format applications . I loved the ergonomics , the incredible reliability and the uncomparable craftsmanship and optical quality of Pentax professional products - up until now . I 've purchased this lens brand new from Amazon and owned it for a year before giving up on it after the third and final replacement I got from Pentax due to horrible distortions , lack of sharpness and / or purple fringing I experienced with all three samples . I am still spending hours in Photoshop trying to salvage many compositionally great images I took with all three samples of this lens I owned . Some images can not be saved due to significant lack of sharpness ( this was the third sample I received - horrible autofocus errors in addition to fringing and distortion ) , but most are salvageable , since the distortions I experienced were mostly of a simple linear type , and are correctable in Photoshop , although the second sample of this lens had an incredibly complex wavy distortion patterns , which can not be corrected by regular means or by DxO software . The purple fringing is another matter entirely , taking hours of painstaking labor to remove and was prominently present in all three samples I had . This experience forced me to switch to Nikon for my wide-angle needs ( I purchased the horribly overpriced but optically unsurpassed 14-24mm lens for the D700 I was also obliged to purchase to use this lens ) , but I am using the now discontinued but simply incredible Pentax 645 and 6X7 lenses on the D700 from 35mm focal length and up via a mount adapter . I was forced to sell off my Pentax bodies , in part because their other current lenses also suffer from total lack of quality control . The bottom line - if you need a good quality wide angle lens for your Pentax , DO NOT BUY THIS LENS ! Consider a Tokina 11-16mm lens instead , which beats Pentax 's and every other manufacturer 's 12-24mm offerings hands down . It is very sad to see such a great optical designer and manufacturer as Pentax go down the drain ! I am giving this lens two stars instead of one , because the SMC Pentax coating performed flawlessly - no ghosting , even when shooting directly into the Sun ( do not try this with Nikon 14-24mm ! ) and because the physical build of this lens is great - solid , light and ergonomically superior .  
2	  Edel of Seattle must have gotten a defective unit , or his laptop is made out of lead . I was very impressed with the range and tracking of this mouse . I even tested it by putting my PowerBook at one end of a 6-foot table and using the mouse at the other end , and it worked perfectly . The software is intuitive and has all the necessary controls for both Mac OS X and Windows . The zoom feature is also pretty nifty , and also works on both platforms ( although slightly differently , on the Mac the whole screen zooms , on the PC only a boxed area does ) . The high-resolution optical tracking works great even for demanding applications like games . Overall I can't really find anything to not like about the mouse . Those with bigger hands might not find its small size comfortable , but it fits my hand perfectly . Also , the scroll wheel is " smooth scrolling " rather than having the detents that most mice have . It doesn't make a big difference personally but I know some people prefer a " clicking " scroll wheel .  
1	  I bought this to go from my iPod Touch to a 3.5mm input jack on an amplifier . Everything went together OK - BUT - NO SOUND . I read other reviews where the 4th generation changed something in the OS that would make these inoperable . In any case it seems well made and MIGHT work for an older iPod but not this one . SO I have to give it 1 star .  
2	  I bought this a while back-one for myself to record meetings , ideas , brief notes , etc . , and another for family use . This is a superb digital recorder , even if the Olympus support page ( such as it is ) turns out to be pretty lame . This recorder does have some voice announcement support , which is helpful for people with low / no vision ; however it does not read file titles which would be a most desirable addition ! The whole " machine " is very small and handy . It has a choice of mono or stereo mikes , as you 'll know from reading the description . Controls have been thought through in a good fashion and the choices for setup are many . It works nicely with Macs . The DS-30 ( and DS-40 , etc ) shows up as an external drive on the desktop-and you go from there . There is also a report on a thread that you can get an update on the DSS Player from the Olympus webpage under downloads for the DS-2 . I have not tried that . Again , this is a superb digital recorder . You won't go wrong .  
2	  I originally purchased the D-Link equivalent and was very disappointed . I moved to the Netgear and I 'm very satisfied up to this point . Once connected , everything ( using the default configuration ) worked like a champ ; all computers and other wireless devices could access the Internet , and the DHCP was already working . I created the necessary drive maps and began to fiddle with the other configuration settings . The first things I noticed that pleased me were that the web interface was very well designed and settings I changed took effect immediately ( such as changing the password ) - this may not sound like a big deal , but that wasn't true for the D-Link equivalent . It is always nice knowing that you are working under the configuration you have set , and not having to wonder if they 've taken effect . Many of the network settings also took effect without having to reboot , which was also nice . Then I logged in and the router offered to search for updated firmware , I said " yes " , it found one , displayed information about it , and installed right from the router-easy as pie . I configured the security , and everything was working great ! I was also especially pleased with the little stand that came with the router , allowing it to stand upright and keep out of the way of other devices . I noticed on my wireless devices throughout the house the the signal seemed to be stronger and more reliable that with the other router I had . Note : I haven't yet tried to use the Super G 108Mbs functionality .  
2	  I am very happy with the product and with the way I receive it .  
1	  I took approximaly 5 hours to back up ~ 20 G of hard drive information using the fire wire interface . The software was easy to use , Although none of this really matters since the hard drive was no longer recognized by any of my 3 computers after 4 days ! Not wanting to give away 20 G of hard drive data ( i.e. by sending it back for repairs ) it was a complete waste of $ 190 not to mention my time .  
2	  We bought two pair of these earbuds for use with our ipods . They 're great . We weren't sure about the asymmetrical cable , but once we received them and used they we found them to be really convenient and far less cumbersome than traditional " y " cables . The range of frequencies is really good and the variety of earpieces allows you to select the proper size for a snug fit , which helps with the noise reduction . These are great for the price !  
1	  I bought this camera and had to return it , because it was not worth a flip . I used it to record my daughter 's Christmas program a few weeks ago , and I was just lucky that I brought another camera . The image was so blurry , you cannot even see anything but fuzz . If I would not have brought our digital camera , I would not have any memories taken from this event . This camera is so unreliable . I would not recommend this to anybody but maybe a child who wants to use it as a play video camera .  
2	  Easy to set-up and operation was flawless . Would recommend it to anyone who wanted a quality scanner without breaking the bank .  
2	  I used this memory on my PSP and is GENUINE memory , if you want to see if the memory you are buying is genuine , just go to your PSP ( or any sony device ) and try to to see if the " magic gate " is Supported , if it says Unknown or anything else besides " Supported " , the memory its not Genuine . Other than that , it has good speed , and reliability . Hope this helped since there is a major concern about if the product is original or not , thats why some people are getting read errors or weird behavior , I wont buy sony memory since they fake it so good that you cant even tell if the memory is original . Cheers  
2	  It 's not the prettiest USB hub you 've ever seen , but what it lacks in beauty it more than makes up in function and sheer reliability . For years I used one of the Belkin Stackable 7 port hubs and was constantly watching it overheat and reset . The D-Link 7 port usb hub is handling even more of a load than the Belkin without a hiccup and without overheating . I 'm now in the blissful land of a single usb cable running from my laptop to a hub that runs 2 external bus-powered hard drives , external usb speakers , ipad / iphone sync cable , AND an HD webcam . I 'm able to hold a Skype call with the audio playing through the speakers while simultaneous backups are running and syncing my ipad at the same time without a glitch . Why didn't I get this hub years ago ! ? UPDATE ( 2/4/13 ) : While searching for a USB Hub that would charge my 4th gen iPad I noticed that they have changed the picture / model of the hub I originally reviewed . The model pictured is NOT the model that I reviewed .  
2	  The Linksys WRT54GL router is a very capable router out of the box . I cannot attest to Linksys Firmwares operation or stability . I can , however , confidently state that this router , coupled with the Tomato Firmware is by far the best SOHO router I have ever worked with . I received the Version 1.1 of this router and loaded it with Tomato immediately . Be aware that doing this most assuredly voids your warranty , but it is well worth it . I am running Tomato 1.19 but he is up to version 1.20 though as of this writing . I have experience with numerous routers from several manufacturers . Nothing compares to the Linksys WRT54GL and Tomato .  
2	  Alright , I just got the speakers in the mail yesterday ( In only 2 days ! ) . They sould REALLY good and the subwoofer really kicks as .. butt . The ONLY reason I had to give the speakers less than 5 is that the strong magnet in the subwoofer is unshielded , there are no warnings ( I could see ) and it worries me that it could have damaged my computer . Now I know that ALL speakers use magnets and they shouldn't be placed in direct contact with your computer , but it didn't occur to me that the one on the subwoofer would be strong enough to distort my monitor or cause my computer to restart . When I got the speakers , I unloaded everything and put the subwoofer on the desk near my monitor . Looking back at my monitor , I noticed the color was distorted on the side of the screen where the subwoofer was . Now when I was trying to reposition it away from the monitor , I got it too close to the computer case and it switched off all of a sudden . It came back on and seems to work alright , but I have no way of checking for possible damage . Right now I put the subwoofer on the product box on the floor where it 's away from all my computer components on the desk . I 'm thinking about trying to find some stickers that say " Warning : powerful magnetic field " to put on the case .  
1	  Terrible support - extremely long wait times on hold with eventual cutoff ; product failed shortly after warranty expired with loss of all data .  
1	  My iFM worked great on my iPod Photo . It was a convenient compact size , and had great FM reception even inside buildings . I also used it to record FM radio . I used it about two or three times per week for two months when suddenly the FM radio only received static . It simply stopped receiving FM . I ONLY used this FM receiver indoors at my health club , and never abused it in any way . Boo to Griffin for such a weak product .  
2	  My husband wanted a shower radio for a long time , and picked up a cheap one at Bed Bath and Beyond . As one might expect , it stopped working within six months . I ordered this radio to surprise Hubby , and we 've both been really pleased with it . The sound quality and reception are great . It came in handy during a freak March snowstorm that took out our power , leaving us without lights or other sources of entertainment for more than four hours . At that point we 'd had the radio for about a month and had to replace the batteries shortly afterward , but haven't since . This radio was a good buy and we 're both pleased with it .  
2	  Good product , but has some drawbacks . Viewing screen can be difficult to see in bright sunlight . Picture quality is good , however it would be nice to see a larger piture when viewing movies on the computer . Otherwise it is a very nice product and is easy to carry around and use . I have encountered no problems in operating it . Sound quality is also good .  
1	  I purchased my Rio Carbon in October 2004 . When I first received it , it was automatically resetting after playing about 6 or 7 songs . I contacted Rio Customer Support , and they advised me to " flash the firmware " , which basically means load a new operating system . After that , it worked fine for about 6 months . I was very happy with this MP3 player during that time . In general , I prefer to give new market products a try rather then migrating to the market dominator ( in this case the iPOD ) . My only negative comment is the cheezy leather case . There is no clip or anything on it , so you have to put it in your pocket . This was inconvenient for me while running because the earbud cable was stretched to the max , and since some of my running shorts don't have pockets I had to invent ways to hold the player in place ( use your imagination here ) . Other than that , though , I would have rated 5-stars . BUT THEN .. while adjusting some playlists and other functions a few weeks ago , it came to my attention that there was a new version of firmware available . I don't recall if it was the the Rio Music Manager software or actually on the Rio web site , but one of the two suggested that flashing the " new " firmware to achieve additional capabilities and other marketing nonsense . So , I went to the Rio web site , downloaded the new firmware , and flashed my player . This was the beginning of the end . Immediately , the player began resetting automatically again after playing 6 or 7 songs . After about a week , it died totally . No matter what I did , I couldn't get the player to turn on , light up , or respond in any way . I immediately contacted Rio Customer Support , and they gave me a checklist of things to try . I tried .. nothing worked . When I replied that the checklist didn't work , a different tech sent me another checklist . This process repeated 5 or 6 times with a different technician each time , and I eventually began getting the same checklists again . When I finally got someone to read my e-mail rather than send me another checklist , they told me that my player was out of warranty and they would sell me a new one for $ 99 . When I explained that the player died after a Rio-directed firmware update , they told me that my player was out of warranty and they would sell me a new one for $ 99 . When I asked if they actually read e-mails from customers or just issue pre-programmed responses , they told me that my player was out of warranty and they would sell me a new one for $ 99 . I then told them to relax , take a deep breath , and hold it until I send them $ 99 . I ordered my iPOD this morning .  
1	  At a time when technology has advanced color printing quality , customer service just has not kept up . Canon , maker of some of the finest optical equipment in the world , has used advanced technology to produce a printer capable of amazing color print quality . The photos glow . Paper selection is critical as is the use of OEM inks . Black & white printing is just not on the same par as the color . This must be a driver issue in that the black rendering on the prints looks great . I contacted Canon on this issue and got the run around . Here is where the enthusiasm gets trampled . I don't use this printer much as I have access to several laser units at work for critical and big jobs . When I do use it , I try to pool a set of color or plain text prints into one lot as this beast really sucks up the ink like an overweight SUV sucks gas . The evaporation rate on the inks is rapid as part of the quick dry feature . Canon does not warn you that idleness is costly . That being said , I have printed approximately 1 ream of paper on this , most either in draft or standard mode , and only around 35 % of the pages being full page printouts . I have gone through about twenty 8 x 10 gloss photos , 1 t-shirt transfer and 6 of the new 4 x 6 Photo Paper Plus Glossy . This unit is on its 4th black ink tank , 3rd set of color tanks . The unit sat idle after our recent move to our new home for about 2.5 months . Upon setting up the unit again , I noticed a marked decrease in quality . I followed the deep head cleaning several times , regular cleaning cycle a few times , realigned the heads and adjusted everything per instructions and even installed new ink . The unit will not print anything but the faintest gray when the call is for black bold . The cleaning sucked dry the entire 69.00 ink tank set , installed new , no success . Contacted Canon who informed me to perform several more deep cleanings - sucked down 3 of the 6 tanks in the process and still no better . They are now telling me it is the printhead . But relax , it can be replaced for 100.00 . Canon refused to help . So , long story short and lesson learned . Unit sucks down the ink as fast as a drunk at a free beer concert , is rather on the noisy side and has cost me more in ink to print say 500 pages and a few photos than the original cost of the printer . If I add in new tanks and a new printhead , the cost of ownership for this unit would reach 1.00 a page for black printing . This unit , after its very short lifespan , will be replaced with a HP . Canon needs to learn more about customer support and more importantly , customer relations .  
1	  Looking for an FRS radio and GBS in one unit ? This is not it - Yet ! FRS communications are garbled and intermittent betweenother 120 's and Motorola handhelds . Per Garmin support , microphone and speaker have problems workingtogether . Software fix to adjust mic gain fail to fix the problem . I hope there is a hardware fix soon . Had to return two units . To be fare , the GPS works well and has lots of nice features . The serial interface also functioned with Topo USA well . I Truly look forward to a unit that works as advertized .  
1	  Just got the ViewSonic monitor for 1 year , and it breaks ! I called ViewSonic 's customer service and tried to reason with them , absolutely terrible customer service ! The representatives were very rude , they even hang out on me . Apparently , hanging out on customers is the best way to avoid any " problems " for the customer representatives . I had such a bad experiences with ViewSonic , I will never purchase any products from them ever again ! I think everyone deserves to know about what the company 's services are like before their purchase . Please be aware when you buy any of ViewSonic 's products ! ViewSonic CANNOT PRODUCE MONITOR LAST LONGER THAN ONE YEAR !  
2	  The 2nd remote worked great right out of the box . I just entered my components into the harmony software and it did the rest . The first remote i got the volume up and channel down didn't work . Harmony sent me a new remote and everything was taken care of .  
2	  This is the ultimate GPS . I have the msn direct working great , I have the GPS working great , all these things going right and one small issue that wont affect most people . If you are a Treo 700P user , the bluetooth has an error , that displays the last number called instead of the current number called . Called Garmin , they say no fix in place . But with the exception of that one thing , this is hands down the greatest GPS I have ever touched . Big bright screen , responsive buttons , accurate mapping , voices that pronounce correctly ( tom tom users eat your heart out ) . I considered the 660 but for a year of MSN Direct and its features , it was clearly worth it . UPDATE ! If you update Sprint phone software for the treo 700p to 1.10 your bluetooth issue will go away .  
2	  This was a great headset ! Everything was built with great quality . The sound and all were excellent ! Problem was it broke after 3 months . Why ? The damned wire is wayy too long ! It is all over the place . It kept getting tugged under the wheels of my computed chair until eventually the wires go stressed and now I cant hear a thing unless I really wiggle the wires . Would I buy it again ? Yes , but now that I know the flaws I can be prepared to meet them head on ! With proper care this will be the only headset you will ever need !  
1	  I bought 2 6ft cable both were defective . They tansmitted the pictue fine but the sound was intermittent . SRS  
1	  I have bought several of these . Some came in a fancy blister , and others in a coushing bag . Stay away from those . Be sure you 're buying the sealed one because the physical design is a lot different . I give the generic two stars just because it works . I give four stars to the original because as others reviewers have said it 's a little difficult to remove the card .  
1	  So my TV makes this popping noise with the sound and is especially aparent when the tv is in the srs surround sound mode . I was so amped for this tv but so far its been a huge bust . Maybe I one of the few , but so far samsung has had very mediocore service , from customer service to the repair technician . They arent going to let me send it back until the repair guy trys 3 times to fix it . It already needs a new mother board . I didnt even know tvs have monther boards . Also the S-video cable was very hard to install the prongs for my dvd player . Also for people that have the tv now . Do not use " Dynamic Mode " it comes this way and the picture looks great . But your contrast is set at 100 and will burn out your bulb real quick FYI . Move to around 85 to save the life of your bulb . So far some HD channels look great some mediocore . It might be my cable box . I dont know the espn baseball games look good and the FOX games look like garbage . As for videogames it works great on my 360 and there really is no lag problems . I have to miss time from work now and now I regret not buying a flat pannel . Update : Its been almost 18 days now since I called Samsung and their technician keeps reschdueling with me . This has been a horrible experience . I also notice alot of motion blurr on hdtv channels when the camera moves really fast , like tracking a homerun leave the park . So mad I bought this thing . Update . August 08 I need another motherboard . Samsung is hastling over whether or not they will replace my tv . My audio out does not work now . Way to go samsung . The part is on back order . So I take it this happens all the time . Terrible , terrible purchase . Do you know how much of a pain this is to take time off of work to meet a repair guy 3 times in a month ? Samsung I need a new tv . NOWUpdate : August 14th Samsung has been a nightmare to deal with . After calling on hours on end once a day for the past month they finally are replacing my tv . Good luck if anything ever goes wrong with your tv . This has been THE worst experience as far as purchasing a big ticket item . An Insider Tip if you have to deal with their customer service dept . Immediately Ask for an ERC , they over see the customer service reps and have authority to solve your issues . If I could give this tv 1 star I would . For some reason I cant change it . Anyways . I honestly think Samsung has posted the majority of these reviews so be careful .  
1	  This unit has pretty good sound when playing DVDs using the built in DVD player . I even tested the crossover point ( ? ) from the speakers to the subwoofers and I could not distinguish where the crossover point is which means everything seems well balanced . The moment I switch to any other mode though other than the built in DVD player ( radio , video1 and video2 ) , I get a lot of hiss from the center and rear channels and the only way to mask out the hiss is to crank the volume way up so that the sounds from the front speakers are louder than the hiss . I thought I have a defective unit so I returned it and got a new one and I still get the same problem . Another annoying thing about this system is that the unit itself clicks ( not though the speakers ) everytime it changes tracks either from a dvd or audio cd . I can live with the clicks , but the hiss is just too much . I 'm going to return my unit and get a different and quality brand , probably a kenwood or something . I would not recommend this to anyone until Classic finds a way to get rid of the hiss , otherwise , this would 've been a perfect unit for as I am not an audiophile .  
1	  This is a great mouse when you first get it . Lightweight , super precise , customizable buttons , egronomic , good looking . But when used regularly for long periods , battery life suddenly goes into the toilet . That is , you end up swapping batts seriously every 10-20 minutes . This started after about 6 months . Super disappointing . Went back to the trusty MX700 . G7 is now collecting dust , both batteries dead . Along with my heart .  
2	  I only needed a short ( 6 ft ) HDMI cable to complete our change over to a new HD TV , new Blue-ray DVD player and Tivo HD box setup . One cable I had was only 3 ft and too short . I drove around to four local stores to find one . All had an HDMI 6 ft cable - at prices ranging from $ 18 to $ 36 . Nothing doing , I thought . Twenty years ago I worked for a start-up Network manufacture and we would purchase all kinds and lenghts of cables , the most expensive of which never exceeded $ 5 . One day back then we were short one cable for a urgent shipment . I drove to the local radio shop to find they too had the needed cable - for $ 25 . After I chewed out the sales clerk for such a high price , he admitted the only thing the store made money on was the cables . The TVs , the stereos , the computers all broke even , but they made a pile on the cables . So , last month I checked with Amazon and they had a HDMI cable cat2 for only $ 1.99 with free shipping ! I couldn't believe it . Must be a scam . Impossible ! Well , being the big spender , high risk taker that I am , I ordered two cables just to test the purchase . I mean , with only four bucks to lose , what the hell , eh ? Got the cables in about five days by mail . They looked good . I plugged them about a week ago .. and did they work ? Hell yes , they worked . They have worked great every day and night since . What a deal !  
1	  For the price I know I shouldn't have expected anything really great but the sound quality of this CD player is so bad that I can't stand to listen to it . Don't waste your money .  
2	  Easy to set up and use . Worked great . Would recommend and / or buy again .  
1	  We just upgraded the wiring to Cat6 in my office . I purchased 2 GS605s and one GS608 for some end point distribution . Everything went ok on the GS608 - except for a combination printer / fax / copier we have . The people we lease from said that that happens sometimes with their copiers and gave us a Linksys gigabit switch to use - just for the printer . Worked fine . Then when I tried to bring up the other half of the office using one of the GS605 units I kept getting wired problems .. printer\copier\scanner ( same model as before ) connected at 10mbs on the scanner but would not connect for the printer . One user I could not connect at gigabit speeds so I replaced the cable ends - 2 times . Well the lease company came in and again , gave us a Linksys gigabit switch and I tried plugging that in instead of the Netgear unit .. everything came up - printer\copier\fax\scanner , the user I replaced end on was at gigabit speeds and the unit is running fine - with very little heat coming off of it unlike the Netgear that was almost hot while it was installed .. In the past I usually used Linksys and I guess I will continue to use Linksys ..  
1	  I found the sound to be tinny and thin , not nearly as rich as the stock buds that came with my Sandisk m240 MP3 player . I really expected better from Sennheiser . I dont consider the quality of the sound or the construction to be above the average . And certainly not what I expected from dedicated sound drivers , even on the lower end ear-canal buds .  
1	  Gave me a break , this was a true con artist . amazon should drop from his advertisment . This makes double con ! Increadible , try to rip off the client by giving false advertisement . What you see in the ad is not what you get . BE CAREFUL  
1	  I already have a decent inkjet , but I wanted one with higher resolution and better photo-realism . I read reviews about the C80 . The resolution on it is fantastic . But , after running 4 hours of trials on it ( in a serious attempt to achieve decent color ) , I decided to return it . On my other printer ( only 1440 dpi ) the colors are crisp , rich , and sharp - especially the blacks . Looking at conventionally developed photographs , the same can be said . On the C80 , the colors are VERY muted - DULL . I called Epson , and they confirmed that the archival inks have a different tone than their standard inks . The Espson driver doesn't even offer an independent control over the black saturation ( even though it does provide one for cyan , magenta , and yellow ) . If you 're looking for realistic photos , this is NOT the way to go if color is important .  
2	  These are good headphones . The earcups are large , but that helps give you better sound quality . The signal from the base to the headphones is a FM radio signal , and sometimes you have to adjust it . Overall , these are really good headphones .  
2	  Fantastic investment . It never steers us wrong . No pun intended . My wife and I invested in this product about a year ago and we 've traveled to different states and the maps are flat out PERFECT ! What 's really neat is that it has a feature to show where the state line is if you 're traveling long distances between states . It tells you exactly how long it 's going to take to get to your destination and will automatically adjust if you 're in traffic . It has different language sets , also . A plus , if you want to learn a few different ways to say " Turn Right in 500 feet . " LOLGreat overall !  
1	  I bought two of these for my Canon Rebel XS right before going on a trip . Just a couple of days into the trip when I tried to take a picture , the camera said there was an error , it couldn't read the memory card and my pictures weren't on it anymore . I called the Canon support number and after answering some basic questions they asked if I had formatted the card , which I did , when I first put the card in the camera . But it turns out you should format it every time you upload pictures to your computer or any time you remove the card . I don't know if it 's common knowledge , but I didn't know that , and my camera manual certainly didn't state that . Apparently sometimes just deleting the photos from the card doesn't take all the data off , and it can cause the cheaper cards to malfunction . The tech support guy then asked what brand my card was . When I told him Transcend , he said the higher end cards like Scandisc are less sensitive . That same day I bought a Scandisc card , and I haven't had any trouble with it . It cost me $ 10 more for one 4GB Scandisc than for these two 4GB memory cards , but if I have less chances to have another malfunction , I 'll pay for it . I just wish I hadn't bought those other two first . Transcend are probably okay cards , but if you don't want to risk your photos , I 'd spring for the Scandisc . The moral of this review is really don't forget to format your memory cards .  
1	  Bought it to use on an airplane . Doesn't have enough volume .  
2	  Good cord . Solid construction . It does what it says and I really can't say more than that . I wanted a 10 foot cord so I could reach my laptop anywhere in my room .  
2	  I use this mainly to scan film . It is a little slow , but the quality is awesome . Great product , great price .  
1	  The euro style plug on this box is not grounded , therefore , when it is operating , it is a fire hazard and unsafe and will shock you if you touch it . I also cannot figure out how to get it to operate at the voltages advertised besides going from 110 to 220 or 220 to 110 . Says on the box it will do 120V , but I don't think it actually does . This is an issue for picky US appliances that expect exactly 120V . I wish I had just spent a little more and got a quality transformer that I didn't have to worry about burning down my house .  
2	  Met every expectation . Easy to install & very affordable . Recieved much sooner than expected . Were told 7-10 days but only took 4 . Very pleased with the buy .  
2	  This GPS worked well for me ! I bought it for when I travel out of town and it was a total life saver for me . On my way back to Myrtle Beach , SC from rural South Carolina for a wedding , there was an accident that had shut down the road so I had to turn off . I immediately hit the detour button and the GPS calculated a brand new route for me to follow within seconds . The text to voice feature is great , never have to take my eyes off the road to know when a turn is coming up . The MSN Direct feature , not really sure how it works as Myrtle Beach is not one of the areas that has it . I 'm glad I bought , I dont know how I drove without it !  
1	  These Dynex cassette adapters were once good products - I 've owned a couple of them in the past . But , like all of these cassette adapters , the thin cord eventually goes bad and you have to replace them . Which is just what I did recently . However , Dynex must have produced a LARGE bad batch of these , because the new one I got was awful . Loud hissing and droning came from the speakers , and the volume coming from the iPod was so low that I had to turn the volume on the tape deck up all the way to even hear it .. which made the hissing , droning background noise overpowering . Obviously it was defective . But when I returned it and exchanged it for another one , the new one had the same problem . I had to get my money back . Dynex , get some quality control and fix these !  
2	  The cover for me does not close flush at the top and bottom when closed / locked .. there was a small gap ( maybe 1/8 & # 34 ;) and since you could view it on-end in my setup it bothered me . I was able to swap out the provided screws with some with a smaller profile head that improved upon things , but still a small gap . Other than the gap it does what it is designed to do - closes up and locks on a Channel Vision structured wiring panel .  
1	  Warning .. Linksys will require you to spend an hour on the phone if your unit fails and they will be VERY reluctant to issue an RMA number .. this is evidently a cost saving measure ( they only earn about 75 cents an hour in India ) . My WRT54G 's firmware became corrupted after a power failure . I printed out some 13 pages from the Linksys website and spent more than an hour dutifully following the instructions . I was able to erase the old firmware , but the new firmware would not install .. . they have steadfastly refused to issue an RMA number .. I don't pretend to be a technical expert at router repair .. but I shouldn't need to be to have my router repaired under warranty ..  
2	  well went through 100 of these , none of the disks that I burned turned out bad yet , that makes 5 stars for me  
1	  This lens performed absolutely miserably with my Canon Powershot S2 IS . It will not focus , and when it did the photos were mediocre at best , certainly no better than the built-in super macro mode . I would not recomend this lens to anyone with any camera . If I could give this lens a 0/5 , I would . TERRIBLE BUY ! I 'm trying to return it , but no luck so far . 47th street photo won't answer the phone .  
1	  I purchased this product to use with Rhapsody , as it is recommended by the service . It 's very simple to set up for a wireless network - I simply entered my WEP settings and rebooted the device . Unfortunately , it loses wireless connectivity way too often to be practical . One " feature " of the player is that it reboots whenever it loses its wireless connection . As each reboot takes a couple of minutes , I got very frustrated getting dropped from the network multiple times in a row while simply browsing my playlists . I don't know if there was some sort of conflict between the player and my Access Point ( a Linksys WAP11 ) , but this sort of wireless performance is simply unacceptable . None of my other wireless devices have any connectivity issues . I didn't try the wired network connection , so I don't know how it performs . Hopefully , it doesn't have the same connectivity issues as the wireless mode . The included software is functional , but limited . It functions as a server applet to which the MP101 connects . It allows you to catalog all of the MP3 or WMA files on your local drive , but it does not have a way to catalog files on network drives from what I could tell . For a networking product , I found this odd . I was also disappointed that you could not control the unit via software . I have a multi-room audio setup and was hoping to be able to play my Rhapsody playlists through it using this product . Unfortunately , you can only control the unit through the supplied remote control . With firmware improvements , this could be a much better product . Hopefully , NETGEAR will address the problems in the near future . As for me , I 'm going to purchase a Slim Devices Squeezebox like the reviewer below did - it has much more robust software , digital outputs and support for Rhapsody ( via plugin ) as well .  
1	  These are the worst sounding earbuds that I have ever put in my ears that cost over USD2.99I mean , they really sound cheap and juvenile . I really feel cheated and would never purchase this product again .  
1	  Within the first 5 minutes of opening the box ( and installing the software ) the player squeaked loudly in my ears and turned itself off . It did this several times . I replaced the battery , checked all the settings .. and was rewarded with having the player turn off the sound ( but leaving the power on ) half the time , and just turning itself off the other half . And yes , I did check the auto-off function . Maybe I got a lemon , but I 've lost faith in this product . Instant return .  
1	  If you buy this printer you will , like me , sorely regret it . As a lot of other reviewers have noted , they too were loyal Epson customers . My C86 was a workhorse , though I did feel the ink ran out kind of fast - I didn't know how good I had it . One reviewer felt that they had been held hostage by this printer . I know the feeling . You can't print in even B & W if one of the inks is out . The print heads are CONSTANTLY CLOGGED so you clean them - and then Voila ' , you have no ink left . This is the sorriest product that I 've ever had . Epson is replacing mine for me with the CX7400 but I 'm not holding my breath . What I really want is a different line of printers but they don't make " refunds . " Oh and , don't bother with ink resetters on this model - the new T069 ink that it uses won't reset . By the way , I only gave it one star because it won't let me give it zero !  
1	  Hace had this for a couple of years now . It is ok and does its job . Often goes to the setup screen which is apain to get out of when you want to watch a DVD . Buy if cheap enough but look around as this unit is nothing special .  
1	  The silicone grip case comes off very quickly and is not strong . Worst silicone case out there , very disappointed in this product !  
2	  I just love this watch ! It keeps great time and the color is lots of fun . Working for an ophthalmologist , I often work in dimly lit rooms . The iridescent dial makes it easy to tell the time .  
2	  These " in-ear " buds are a good , low priced alternative to more expensive offerings . They come with three ( 3 ) differently sized pairs of soft rubber pieces that fit the buds into your ear . Be forewarned that these buds are designed for and do their best work when the soft rubber pieces fit snugly inside your ear , thus forming a seal that creates the solid bass notes lacking in other headphones . After deciding which of the 3 soft rubber pieces best fit my ear , these buds only took a very short time to " disappear " ; They are very light and comfortable . Recommended .  
2	  I 've had mine ( 1g model ) for over a year now and has been great . Not sure what some of the reviewers are talking about though .. & # 34 ; There is software loaded on the drive but unless you pay even more money you can not use the ' vault ' . & # 34 ; The software that came with mine was fully functional and even when Migo bought out the original Portable Vault software folks , Migo is still providing software updates . & # 34 ; The item is bad , I bought it a few months ago and suddenly it stops working and I loose all my information , & # 34 ; They are called backups . They are pretty easy to make .  
2	  When I read some of the other reviews , I was a bit concerned that I wouldn't get the " seal " that others were talking about , but I was happy to find out that the seal wasn't hard to achieve . With a little water ( or spit - eww ! ) , it lubricates the earphones and they fit very snugly . They fit deeper into the ear than the Sony headphones I had . These are MUCH quieter when you get the seal . The volume doesn't have to be turned up nearly as high to to hear clearly . The sound is good on these , too . The main sell for me was to be able to block out noise around me ( I live in New York City ) . You have to be a little bit more aware of your surroundings because they block out the noise so well , but it 's nice to hear your music clearly and have your own soundtrack rather than fight the traffic noise or subway noise .  
2	  It 's a reliable mp3 player , not expensive , for those who are looking for a cheap way to listen music  
1	  We play a cd in our daughter 's room every night on repeat . This cd player had gotten questionable reviews but I went ahead with it . Big mistake . Lasted 3 months before the cd player burned out . We have an Insignia cd player that has lasted more than 1.5 yrs playing in another room . Shame on me for buying a cheaper one .  
2	  The sound of these earbuds are great .. and they are a value for the price . However the " in the ear " design causes them to catch sweat , and they won't last when you sweat into them alot . After 9-12 months of wearing them in the GYM they will stop working . I have gone through 3 pairs in the last 2 years ,  
1	  I bought LinkSys WAP and both PCMCIA and USB NICs . The USB device appears to have twice the range and far more reliability than this PCMCIA device . If you have both a PCMCIA slot and an available USB port , you 're much better off using the latter . By the way , I bought two of the PCMCIA devices and both exhibit identical behavior . Go with the USB ..  
1	  By far the worst software installation I have ever experienced . There is no way that this product went through any kind of quality assurance-it simply does not install . Fortunately , by the fifth attempt , I looked at the Amazon . com comments for this product and found the steps for hand copying files that a previous reviewer provided ( thank you ! ) . Once installed , I found the product to be a satisfactory , basic introduction to French . I think that it is worth the price , at least , once you get it installed .  
2	  I have only been using this battery for a couple of weeks now but so far it appears to be working very well for me . It is holding it 's charge for good time length so now I am hoping to see the battery last a long time . Time will tell .  
1	  It 's a good idea , however the rubber is too soft and the cords don't stay in the notches . I have to wrap the whole bundle with a rubber band and now it looks bulky , well , because it is bulky .  
2	  Can't imagine life without this lens . I owned the 70-200 f4L first , used on the 10D which had poor high ISO / low light performance . The f4L lens itself is spectacular for those who can get away without shooting in low light . I love to / have to shoot in low light , bought this lens in Feb 04 , and it 's rarely off of my current body , 20D . I 'm a pro equine shooter , and for us this lens is the " gold standard " . Also use it with the 1.4x TC and am pleased with its performance . The isometric exercise from hefting the combo has prevented " tricep wave " , which afflicts many of us over 50 . My lenses have to stand up to considerable environmental abuse due to my subjects ' location and both of my Ls are more than up to the task .  
2	  I have had my Zen Vision M now for a month or so-It has the most amazing audio quality , AND the LCD screen is Gorgeous ! The videos look so true to life ! The colors are High Def and so Beautiful . I 've had alot of Mp3 players to date but this one is just out of this world ! Please consider buying this one-I only wish it came with an even bigger hard drive-WOW ! I 've purchased my second Zen Vision M yesterdy ! I am truly hooked ! I transfer my Tivo recordings to my zen and I sit back and watch extraordinary colors and sound ! I 've had a Dell , an iRiver , a Rio 600 , Rio 800 , creative nano and now the zen vision M ( 2 ) . So far it is my pick for the best player out there ! Everyone complains about scratches but to date I have none-just keep your player it the soft pouch supplied with your zen vision , you 'll be fine ! I haven't tried an ipod yet-and I may never-The zen vision M is truly a WINNER in my book !  
2	  I ordered this for my Epson PictureMate printer without reading the description very carefully and thought I was only paying for paper . How great to open up the package and see an ink cartridge , too ! With the super-low price on this pack , it is officially cheaper to print your own digital pictures than to take them to a store to have it done ( especially when you figure in the high price of gas to get there ) . The ink has never smudged and lasts through all 100 pieces of photo paper . The paper is very high quality , and pictures printed on it look like traditionally developed photos .  
1	  The new Zire Palm 21 is essentially an updated version of the original Zire , itself an update of the lowly m100 , with the following changes :* 8MB of Ram ( still not upgradeable ) vs . hobbled 2MB . * A better battery . * A slightly better processor . ( This is largely irrelevant , because most Palm functions are nearly instantaneous anyway ) . All of the other limitations of the original Zire still exist , chief among them the small , dim dark-grey on light-grey ( so very 1979 ) screen and the utter lack of expandability . Believe me , screen size matters when you are pointing and clicking on a tiny keyboard on your Palm . This is by far the smallest , dimmest screen you can buy . The 8MB allows for only relatively basic address and scheduling functions , but is a big improvement from 2MB . It 's intended to be a starter model with limitations that will have you thirsting to upgrade , and often comes free with new computers . The three PALM programs that I consider essential would come close to overwhelming this puppy . They are : Mapopolis ( a mapping program from Mapopopolis . com with keyword-searchable street maps ) , Avantgo ( an online news service that downloads articles to your palm ) and Vindigo ( a restaurant , movie and city guide ) . To me , this model is only for those misguided and poor folks who would have bought the now-discontinued original Zire model but want 8MB . There are far better models out there for only a few more bucks . You can find some of the excellent Handspring Visor or Palm 's own Vx / m500 / m515 models used for far cheaper , which feature larger , brighter grey screens and 8 MB . Sony 's B / W CLIE line of Palm OS handhelds are also better , for a few more bucks . If you can afford it , I 'd definitely trade up to the Tungsten E - which features 32MB , a brilliant hi-res color screen , expandability , MP3 and a slick form factor . It costs twice as much and is worth every penny . Here 's a basic PALM product guide : Zire / Zire 21 / Palm m100 : Bottom of the line . Designed to suck you in but leave you wanting more . Think of this as the Chevy Chevette of Palms . Plagued by skimpy , dim screens . Palm m505 : Discontinued color model features horrible washed out color screen . AVOID AT ALL COSTS . Palm TUNGSTEN TE : The new standard for low-priced , high-value color palms . Features 320x320 brilliant screen , 32MB Ram , MP3 capability with headphone jack , high quality battery and slick , shirt-pocketable form factor . Palm Zire 71 : Excellent , but expensive model features a low-res digital camera that is Okay only for small web page photos or email . Tungsten T2 : Expensive model features drop down graffiti screen . Not worth the extra cash over the TE , unless you need / want Bluetooth . Tungsten T3 : Longer , 320x480 screen . Otherwise , similar to T2 . Expensive . For competitors , check out the Handspring Treo models , which feature thumbpads and a small form factor ( some with phones ) . But I 've heard Sony 's customer service is weak compared to Palm 's easy-as-pie returns . These things do break from time to time , so keep that in mind . Also compare to PocketPCs , which have started to come down into the two-hundred smacker price range , but still can't beat Palm 's small form factor and ease of use .. If you haven't bought a Palm yet , now 's a great time to try it . It 's basically an extension and backup for your brain , and who doesn't need that ? Enjoy !  
2	  Received the fuse holders in just a couple days , very fast delivery ! Surprised at the quality of the in-line fuse holder . Better than I was expecting for the price . Tight cover should keep all moisture out and heavy enough wire to handle at least 30 amps .  
2	  The digital camera worked very well . The price was right and the packaging and delivery time were excellent . Thank you .  
1	  The key press feel , keyboard weight are good to excellent for my taste . I would love to love this keyboard but there are two serious flaws . I 'm not sure if it is Windows specific , in any case , even if it is , I 'd still not trust a hardware keyboard that only works with one OS . First , the blank key that some complained about is a " Fn " key . The ridiculous part in this is that the functions keys are by default in the " special functions " mode . I need to hold down Fn in order to press the regular " F1 " " F2 " etc . Common combo keys in applications such as Excel Shift-F3 becomes Fn + Shift + F3 . Mind you , the order you press the keys is also important . Shift-Fn-F3 does not work . I 'd expect this Fn key to be a toggle . Press once to switch to F1 / F2 / F3 , press again to use the media / function keys . The second , and fatal flaw is that every few mins , the keyboard becomes unresponsive for about 10-15 seconds and starts working again by itself . ( I 'll test this keyboard on a mac and then update this review again ) Update 1/10/2013Today it started too repeat certain keystrokes . As you can see , I'mm just t typing this mmessage wwithout correcting the e crap ccoommining ffrroom tthhis kkeeyboarradd ..  
1	  Out in the open air this radio is fine . But I bought it to use on an above-ground commuter train . Very poor reception on major AM stations and I frequently have to twist it one way or another as the train moves along to hear anything at all , and even worse reception inside my office building . If you need a radio for indoor or in-train / bus use , this is not the one !  
2	  We bought these because we have 2 toddlers and were planning a long trip to Florida from Massachusetts and didn't necessarily want to hear the same movie over and over .. well the headphones were great , they fit their small heads / ears and were comfortable . They liked how they fit and they had their own volume control ( it was never too loud for them so we allowed them to play with the control ) . I would strongly recommend these .. great value for the price and they work for toddlers .  
2	  I got this transmitter based on the reviews here , and I have not been disappointed . I have a long commute ( 1.5 hrs each way ) in a major metro area , but this transmitter handles it with ease using only a single station . Keep in mind that your milage may vary and will be dependant on what free radio frequencies you have in your area . My suggestion is to look online for a resource that will find several free FM stations in your area and write them down . Once you get in the car see if the stations are indeed free ( no clear radio station ) , then tune the FM Transmitter to that station . It should work like a charm and charge your Ipod at the same time . The only downside is that due to using the Dock Connector instead of the headphone jack , there is no volume control . You must use the volume control on your radio . The volume output from the unit to your radio is on the quiet side , so remember to turn the volume on your radio down before changing to local stations .  
2	  This is an easy to use device , despite what another reviewer wrote . It takes about one hour to master all its features , and then it is simple to use . I use it to record the Art Bell show , by placing it near the radio speaker and letting it go the full four hours . There is a bigger memory model , the 480 , which will turn itself on , as well . I use the 240 in the " vox " mode , and it starts recording when my clock radio turns on at 10pm . All I have to remember , however , is to turn the radio " on " within an hour , or the alarm will shut off the radio after an hour . It works fine , and I get a very nice four hour recording of the talk radio show and I can index it , and skip all the commercials and news breaks . It does , however , use a set of AA 's after being on for about 20 hours , so get a set of NiCads for it . It is the best cheapest way to record talk radio . As far as recording live people , that would be a piece of cake . It has all these folders and subfolders , which I don't need , but maybe you do . Bottom line , get one if you want to record voices . Not at all good for music , however . The freq response is not there . The LP mode is fine , it just has a very slight amount of noise in the badground . I don't use the HQ modes , but they are better . I love it , I got mine real real cheap .  
2	  I love mine and I 've had it for 5 years and it still works beautifully . But .. I don't use the CD function . I bought it because it has all the other features I wanted that I couldn't fine in a non-CD alarm clock at the time of purchase . 1 . Gradual wake2 . Dual alarm settings3 . Nap function of 2hrsMy cons : 1 . buttons are very small and it 's not easy for a new user to quickly hit the off button . Of course alarms have a way of quickly motivating the user to learn with deadly accuracy ! 2 . the motorized CD tray is loud and slow to think . I 'm not surprised about all the other reviews complaining about it lasting if you actually use it daily as an alarm .  
2	  This works fine with my MAC Mini and the X10 radio remote antenna .  
1	  Plain and Simple : This product is terrible if you live in an apartment building in a city . I bought $ 5 rabbit ears that worked 100 times better .  
2	  Nice photos for a very good price , a big bargain for a 2,1 Mpixel camara - Some troubles with the lens that can easy to get grooves . This is a very reliable equipment with fast and close-up captures .  
1	  This item will NOT work with the LG Env3 . You get sound through one speaker . Do NOT buy this for that phone . I 've looked all over for one that does , and turns out , the one I bought at The Shack works . Cost a bit more , but it 's the one you want for this phone . Of course , the sellers sell this for a penny , and higher shipping , so you won't return it . Guess I 'm stuck with a paper weight .  
2	  I always wanted to try this paper and finally broke down and spent the $ . It provides a very unique look to a photo print . Not what you want for a punchie bright sunset , but it makes the greatest soft people kids and sleeping dogs , shots . I also tried some foggy trees that came out great ! The colors are very true , and while not quite as vibrant as regular photo paper , this gives a real true matte finish . While it 's not right for every print , it brings a whole new dimension to the right image . Even I can create Fine Art !  
2	  This is a great little mouse . Very lightweight , good range and I love the small size . Have been using it with my netbook , I 'm going to buy another one for my laptop . No set up needed - true plug & play  
1	  Installed the serial port and it created an LPT3 that was unusable . Same problem as another user had ( see other reviews ) . Hope this is not an XP issue and will return mine for another one . Hope this is just a bad one .  
2	  Don't buy the hype OR the HDMI cables from the big box guys . This product is perfect and I think I paid forty cents . Buy these cables ! They are shipped in a plastic bag , so YOU save on shipping and YOU save on packaging . There is no clamshell , bubble nightmare that YOU have to try to infiltrate . Just buy this , save the frustration of fire-bombing your way into Wal-mart 's little bundle of shoplifting resistant hell .  
1	  okay , so I bought this paper to produce tri-fold brochures . I will agree with the other reviewer that it prints beautifully . BUT - as soon as you try to fold it , it cracks and the top glossy layer of paper peels away like a bad sunburn . I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PAPER AGAIN . I have tried it in every possible direction in my printer but it is just very poorly scored . Do yourself a favor - buy regular glossy paper for one third the cost and fold it yourself - I guarantee it will work better .  
1	  This may be a fine modem , but make sure you check with your cable provider-preferably by checking their online listing-as I was informed incorrectly by one of the @ home techs that it was compatible . It did look nice and is well constructed , but of no help to me .  
2	  My cousin in the Phil . needed this to test the radio station he is opening . It did it 's job and now the radio station is on the air .  
1	  I 'm giving this keyboard one star because ultimately a keyboard primarily needs to have keys that are comfortable for me to use and don't impede my input . I found the keys on this keyboard to be way too " spongey " , meaning that the keys press down quite a ways then don't spring right back up .. It was akin to walking through quicksand , if that makes sense .. I found myself having to press the keys harder , and that would then slow down the next key press . Strongly suggest you try this one out in the store !  
2	  rechargable battery lasts for a while , handcrank works well . Usb charging port works grreat for emergengy purposes . Radio works well also  
2	  This binder is the perfect size . It fits on a bookshelf , and doesn't become prohibitively heavy when full of CDs . The loose-leaf system is great because you can add a new disc in a new sleeve , keep it in alphabetical order without moving all the old CDs to make way for the new CD .  
1	  I have ordered two of these and the suction part breaks after each use ! What a rip off . Ordering now straight from Garmin .  
2	  If you purchased this camera under $ 20 , It is pretty good . If it employed CCD not but CMOS , I can completely recommend it .  
2	  I did a lot of research before I bought the DC-280 and the thing that sold me was the reviews of faithful color reproduction . I have not been disapointed . It takes great pics indoor and out . I can even tell you it is rugged . After falling to the floor off a counter top it still performed flawlessly . The colors are vivid , the light range is quite good and it is simple to operate . I recommend a second set of rechargable batteries and a second flash memory card .  
2	  First off , the feet don't fit very well-a comment shared by most reviews on similar items . It was something I was also worried about even before I bought the rack . After getting it , I was eventually able to force the feet on . You just have to apply a great deal of force and almost feel like you 're bending the feet too far , especially since they 're a type of hard plastic instead of rubbery as it looks in the picture . Honestly , it doesn't really make much of a difference whether or not the feet fit or not , since it doesn't change the elevation or the grip of the rack too much ( hard plastic doesn't grip much better than coated metal ) . I use this rack as my mini GTD ( see David Allen ) file folder holder and can generally fit about three folders with little in them , or two somewhat filled folders . They slip in and out easily , and the rack overall looks quite attractive with wood or metal themed desks . Overall , the folders are easy enough to remove , though I expect a stepped variant of this rack to be even easier . It doesn't make too much of a difference , though , and I 'd say that this style is much nicer looking .  
1	  I bought this lens to use with my Canon Rebel XTi . I am not a beginner to digital or SLR so I know what settings to use in each lighting situation . It is impossible to get a good exposure with this lens . More often than not the pictures end up being overexposed . If they aren't overexposed they are underexposed . There seems to be NO middle ground with this lens . Getting a decently exposed shot is like winning the lottery .. next to impossible ! Out of 1500 pictures I managed to get 3 pictures that are properly exposed and they still look really bad . ALL of the pictures come out really soft . They are so soft that they almost seem out of focus . I have no issues while using a different Tamron lens on my camera . It is just this lens . I plan on sending this in to Tamron to see if maybe , just maybe there is an issue with my lens , but I doubt that it will come back in any better shape . If it does then I will edit my review accordingly , but in the meantime .. I wish I had NEVER BOUGHT THIS !  
1	  I had the EXACT same experience as the Feb . 16 2004 reviewer ! The only difference is that my Dimage had to be sent back to the factory straight from the box because it was filled with fine lint like particles . It NEVER has worked properly .. I will never purchase a Minolta anything ! ever ! and I 'll tell all my friends ..  
2	  After much agonizing about the cost of portable dvd players , we found this one at an amazing price . With some hesitation , based on reviews and lack of familiarity with this brand , we bought one prior to a recent 3-hour airplane trip with our three year old daughter . We were pleasantly surprised with the picture and sound quality ( especially at this price ! ) , and the battery lasted exactly a full three hours . And , despite a bumpy flight and an even bumpier 1-hour ride to our destination , we didn't experience one skip or problem . The only thing that was even slightly disappointing is that the battery doesn't " lock " onto the unit very securely and is potentially left dangling by the plug . Not a problem , considering that our usage will be occasional , just something we had to be aware of when we were picking the unit up or moving it . Also , be aware of the fact that this unit doesn't come with headphones . The other accessories are all there , though - car adapter , battery charger , cables to hook up to TV , etc . Sure , we would have felt more comfortable with a name brand like Panasonic or Toshiba , but at this price , this little machine was wonderful for our purposes . We 've been very pleased so far !  
1	  Received the mouse March 10 , 2004 and it quit March 21 , 2004 . When replacing the batteries as though that was the problem , it smelled burned inside . Big disappointment in quality .  
1	  I bought this Creative Zen thinking it would be easy to use . NO WAY ! I tried to load a movie for my kids to take on vacation . HOURS later watching the copy finish it does not work . I contacted customer service - still waiting . HELLOO HEY .. got a good idea for all of you at Creative Zen - why don't you put instructions to accomplish this task in your instruction booklet ? Wish I could return this thing - very unhapy .  
2	  This particular piece of hardware has worked as advertised . Little sucker runs pretty hot but that does not appear to affect its functioning . It works and has not failed me and that 's all I care about . Ran it on WindowsXP .  
2	  The diffence this antenna made is unbelivable . Static-gone . Hissing-Gone . Interference due to people walking around-Gone . This antenna is worth every penny you pay for it , I would pay twice the price now that I know what a difference it makes .  
1	  first of all the battery and the charger were the wrong ones , so i didnt get to record my grandson 's graudation . i was so disappointed about the video camara . so right now it is in a box put away . No battery that fits . No charger either . So I rate this video camara a big ZERO  
2	  Everything you need to know about this player is addressed in the multitude of reviews on this site . The total number of reviews ( almost all of which are positive ) is a clear indicator that this is a great product . I hope to summarize everything I learned in my research , and now my experience , in this review . I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what DVD player ( s ) I wanted to purchase for an upcoming road trip . I wanted to be able to address the needs of my wife , dealing with a toddler on a daily basis , while also providing a solution for a teenager , pre-teenager and toddler on road trips . Eventually , I decided on purchasing two of these players and I am glad I did . I give the player an overall rating of 4 stars because there are some small things that Coby could have done to make the product perfect . The Good - what set this product apart for me * Compact and rugged design , everything feels well constructed on this player * All accessories are included ( headphones , cables , headrest mounting bag , remote , car charger , wall charger , desktop stand ) * Decent sound and image quality * Easy to use * PriceThe Bad - what to be aware of before you buy * Clamshell disc loading , the player must be removed from the provided case to change discs * The headrest mounting bag does not provide a snug fit , when attached to seats , it tends to flex and bend , potentially covering buttons or connections * The headrest mounting bag covers the IR receiver for the remote control ( I was able to work around this with a hole punch ) * The desktop stand is flimsy and not very secure * The device cannot be used as a monitor ( no A / V in ) . This means that you cannot hook up a video game system , and you cannot connect two together to watch one video . * The screen is relatively easy to scratch . I would recommend purchasing an adhesive screen protector ( preferably one that can be reapplied ) . These can be found from a variety of sources on the web . Overall , I am very happy with my purchase and hope to get quite a lot of use out of these . I purchased a two year extended warranty for each , just in case .  
1	  This thing is a piece of garbage . I had one sitting in a drawer that I quit using a while back ( replace with something better ) . I pulled it out the other day for a different application , and now I remember why it was in the drawer . The thing BARELY works , it locks up , linksys ' support is a joke , their latest firmware still doesn't help . You 'd think in 3 years they could fix the bugs .. the problem is they don't care .. It 's now in the garbage , as the cheap flimsy case isn't even useful as a door stop ..  
2	  This is a great little item . It DID NoT work at first and packed it up to send it back . But then I connected an older monitor that I had and it works great . Not sure why it was not working with that particular monitor . It seemed that the monitor wanted to self adjust and could not . At any rate , I am very happy with the way it works .  
1	  I bought this set about 10 days ago . As far as the picture quality , this set is great . But as soon as I started playing Xbox on it , I noticed a lag from the time I pushed a button and when the action would happen on the screen . There are extensive postings about this problem on the web ( including Samsung 's own web site ) . IF you plan on playing video games on your set , stay away from this one . I have returned mine and am in the process of buying a different set .  
2	  I needed a replacement for my broken receiver . I ordered this denon and it works great . I would highly recommend this !  
2	  This is a stylish CD holder that is well constructed . The outer case supports your collection , where similar products do not . I have now ordered 6 of these and will continue to organize my collection with this product .  
1	  I have had this for 6 months now , it works intermittently at best . I get it working all set up with everything fine . This will last for a couple of days . Then it stops working , so I have to unplug it to get it to reset ( I guess ) . After unplugging , it will work again for a day or two , then back to having to unplug it . I am getting something else .  
1	  I got this scanner and hooked it up to my PC with no problems . It scanned really good images from photos until .. I had noticed large specs on the photos in the same areas each time . I read the instructions on cleaning the glass and scanned again .. but they were still there . Upon further examination of the glass , there were large particles of dust underneath the glass with no way to get it out . I contacted Canon directly and they said it was " anti-glare treatment " applied under the glass . Whatever ! The Canon rep said I would be compensated under their warranty terms for a refurbished scanner of the same kind . I told them to take a flying leap ! Never again will I buy a Canon product !  
2	  This TV is great ! It came as one piece , packaged very well . The picture is crystal clear and was easy to operate . It was hooked up and running in minutes . My HD Tivo looks great and I can't wait for football season to start .  
2	  Corsair is top notch in terms of quality and warranty . they are the best in my book and this ram is a steal of an upgrade for making your old pc run more programs faster !  
2	  Great product for a Sat-Ready head unit ! Plug and play .. couldn't be easier . Works exactly as advertised and after 6 months , no problems to report .  
1	  I own this camera for about 2 years . The problem is the lens cover slider track . The metal track has just worn away just from opening and closing the lens cover . Now the lens cover will not stay on the camera causing the battery to die . This is a manufacturing defect  
1	  Initially I liked this product . I 've owned it 1 1/2 years and it died on me . I 'm very disappointed .  
2	  The Flip is a cool device . It 's small size ( a fat deck of cards ) makes shooting snap-videos as easy as taking digital stills . Perfect for a vacation , for getting stealth video clips , and for anyone who wants to make quick , easy , home made films . The built-in USB connector is a great feature , allowing you to drag . avi files to your desktop . The simple design is also welcome .. not too many features to tempt you . After all , this is about quick snap-videos , not perfect film . I would recommend the 60 minute version . You 'd be surprised how fast 30 minutes goes . And for the price , it 's worth it . Speaking of price , these things are an amazing value . Only downside : although the hard plastic construction feels sturdy , the Flips are not the most resilient devices in the world . I 've bought a bunch for a work project and two have broken . But what can you expect for a$100 device .  
1	  This is a very old USB Bridge ( USB to SATA / IDE ) using dated technology . It does not work with over half of my hard drive test needs . I upgraded to an All In One Driver USB connection . It is FAR superior to the bridge for sale here . It has LEDs to indicate the bridge 's status , it works much better with both IDE and SATA drives ( laptop and desktop ) . I would recommend the All In One Driver bridge .. but not the USB Bridge listed here .. cheap is no susbstitute for quality performance .  
2	  This is the 3rd battery sled I have used in my APC unit . The first two were factory units at literally double the cost and I see no performance difference at all so far . Highly recommended .  
2	  I had bought this camera as a replacement for my " old " 2MP Olympus , and I must say that Olympus have done a great job . The pre-set dial on the back makes selecting shooting modes much easier , with choices of Auto-shoot , programmed auto-shoot ( where you can create your settings ) Manual , movie mode ( Quick Time movies with sound ) self-portrait , landscape / portrait , sport , night scene , and landscape . The viewfinder ( an rarity with point and shoot digital cameras these days ) , is a little small , but does the job . The screen is incredibly sharp and gives you a real sense of how the shot will turn out . It is very nice in the hand , and very stable to use ( no more camera shake ! ) In short , a crisp , clean , sweet camera , and well-recommended .  
2	  The sound quality from the Klipsch iGroove is fantastic ! The system is easy to use , doesn't take up much space and is extremely portable . It even has a " handle " in the back to make it easy to move from place to place . The little remote that comes with the system is very convenient as well . I can change the volume or song playing on my iPod from across the room . I 'm very pleased with my purchase and I 've been enjoying the iGrove every day in every room in my house ! I would highly recommend this product .  
2	  Have ordered twice off of here and no problems both times . And a heck of lot cheaper than buying these in the store .  
2	  This product cleans to perfection ! I spent quite a bit on my monitor ( Samsung 21.3 " LCD ) and wanted a kit to keep it clean and free from surface damage . With LCD screens you want to be careful when cleaning them . Do not press too hard on the surface otherwise you will damage the pixels . It makes it easier to see dirt and streaks when an LCD is off . So , with your monitor off , spray cleaner onto surface of monitor . Just enough to coat the entire surface . Unless you get crazy spraying , this product will not run down the face of the monitor . Then wipe the screen down with the cloth that comes with the kit . There 's no streaks , dirt or lint left behind . It 's amazing ! All you get is a clean surface . For stubborn dirt , it is recommended to use a circular motion when rubbing . My shipment also arrived promptly from Sixth Avenue Electronics . I 'm am highly pleased with this product and recommend it to any one who has LCD monitors . :) Roger S. Bullock  
2	  I have had over two hours of struggle trying to get these points with just xbox . So I came to amazon and I found this wonderful deal ! SUPER FAST ! I am not over exaggerating when I say this took less than two minutes . Fast easy and painless ! So wonderful I will definitely be purchasing from them again ! SO DONT HESITATE THEY ARE VERY RELIABLE ! :)  
1	  There is a widespread problem with RCA dvd machines being able to play , ' A Bug 's Life ' . This movie is one of the best ever made for the format , and the first all digital transfer of a film . I suggest if you have an RCA brand ( or Proscan ) dvd-player that you get this disk and see if it works . Usually , the player wil throw back an error message after five minutes , saying " Incompatible Disk " . If you do put it in enough times , you may be able to get it to play on the forth or fifth try . However , if you are not happy with this performance , you may take your player back , because this is a manufacturer 's defect and is subject to a full refund no matter how long you 've had your dvd-player . I think the problem may be as rampant as 1 in every 2 players . Be sure to check your system out .  
2	  I will never use my apple ear-buds again . These sound simple amazing . Only problem is that they feel a little uncomfortable tucked into my ear channel . But that 's the nature of the ear-buds .  
2	  This product just cleaned up a 300 + count of DVD nightmares . No more shelves , boxes , packaging , etc . Loaded 300 DVD in 2 hours . Fast response , just pick from your printed list or via software and out pops your selection fast . I will purchase another one today .  
2	  This case is compact and stores my player and cords very nicely . For what I use it for it is great . I would buy another if I needed to .  
2	  The chip-set will allow 64-bit Windows machines to speak RS-232 without issues . It 's works . What 's more to like ?  
1	  I 've ordered these for years and had few to no coasters per 100 pack . The recent pack I ordered I haven't been able to burn a single one . Why would they work in my Plextor burner before and not now ? You can't say the media isn't supported by my burner . Unfortunately , I threw away the wrapper , but I am deducing these are made in another country - India ? Malaysia ? I very much doubt they are the same TDK -R discs I used to order . I 've recently tried Verbatim discs and have no problems burning them . Just want to warn others that if you liked these in the past , you might not like them now . Better check the label when they arrive to see where they were made . If it says Taiwan , I think you should be ok . If not , don't throw out the packaging , but try burning one disc . If that fails , you could try a few more . But then send them back . It 's terrible when a trusted company fails like this . :-(  
2	  You need to spend some time with the camera and the owner 's manual before taking it on your next safari , but it has great flexibility and produces great shots . I like the fact that the viewfinder is a small video screen so you can see exactly what is going to be in the picture as well as using it to review pictures . Battery life was very acceptable using name brand rechargeable batteries that were slow charged .  
1	  The sound in these ear phones are exceptional . The only problem is that they do not fit right in my ears so I cannot fully enjoy the high quality of sound . I tried to put them on as many different ways and they just didn't feel or look right . Pity .  
1	  This case it too small for the A640 . It barely squeezes in , and when it 's in the velcro on the top reaches the case body velcro connection by only a few mm . The strap doesn't go through the strap hole but slides out the side and stresses the case . Canon should have made a different case for the A640 .  
2	  This is a quality made UV protection filter . Not only does it protect your camera from the sun but no photographer should be without a UV filter . They not only protect from UV but also prevent lens breakage . If your lens was accidently hit by an object the UV filter would likely prevent your expensive lens from being broken . It is much cheaper to break a UV filter than your camera lens .  
2	  I bought this lens used & # 8230 ; It & # 8217 ; s in great shape . I love it , am using it on Nikon D600 . Good all-around carry lens . The macro is fantastic . I used it to shoot a small wedding . It covered all situations well . Only issue ( not the lens ) & # 8230 ; The lens did not come with the original lens hood . I purchased a wide angle metal hood but it vignettes at 28 to just over 35mm when I have a filter on the lens . The original hood mounts back on the body of the lens . So would prolly work better . So I need to find an original Nikon hood . Else I & # 8217 ; m a happy camper .  
1	  Don't buy this kit if you intend to use it with ipod classic ( specifically ipod classic 120Gb ) ! I have an ipod classic 120Gb . The charger couldn't charge my ipod . I couldn't sync my ipod with my computer using the included usb cable . When I unplugged the wall adapter , there were sparks coming out of the wall outlet . This is a very unsafe product that can potentially destroy your ipod . Just don't buy it . Instead buy a used apple 's charger ( plus the usb cable ) for just $ 10 more on ebay .  
2	  I have a complete Home Theater System ( HTS ) in my grand room ( 14 ' ceiling ) including an ipod dock for my tuner , but I did not want to crank up the whole system to listen to music by myself . I bought the Bose SoundDock for this reason , and it has accomplished this in grand style . The sound quality actually rivals my HTS , and believe me I have a top notch HTS . My HTS has pairs of speakers located thoughout the house , but the SoundDock carries into the other rooms with the same high quality sound . I am very happy with the Bose SoudDock and highly recommend it to anyone considering puchasing an ipod docking system .  
1	  I bought these from another seller . Only 3-4 of the disks worked in my Philips CDR800 CD recorder . Even the ones that worked had issues-i . e . , I had to reboot the CD recorder after finalizing .  
1	  I bought this drive to use on both PC and Mac , and paid extra for double layer and lightscribe capabilities . After fiddling with it for 2 days , I am returning it . It is as slow as my old DVD writer ( internal ) at copying movies from my hard drive ( appears to be 1x ) . The tech support is lousy ( not toll-free , and busy all the time ) , the enclosed software difficult to use , and all in all I am extremely disappointed . I am a computer trainer by profession , so I figure if I can't use it , a lot of other people won't be able to either . Don't bother unless you want to beat your head against a wall all night trying to get it to work .  
2	  I 've actually lived with both TheBoom v4 and the Plantronics MX500 headsets for a fair amount of time . Here 's the apples-to-apples comparison : Comfort : Plantronics winsTheBoom uses a soft rubber ear bud that goes into the outer ear canal , plus a coated moldable " wire " you shape to fit around the top / back of your ear . While the earbud portion is comfortable , the moldable wire becomes very uncomfortable after about 30-45 minutes , and downright painful after one hour . The Plantronics uses a hard egg-shaped ear canal insert that could be more comfortable , although after a minute or so , you pretty much forget it 's in there . The soft rubber under / behind-ear harness is quite comfy . Weight : Plantronics winsTheBoom tends to slip out of position fairly often due to its shape and weight ( the " sweet spot " as others have called it , is the limited area that your voice will register with the headset , as opposed to being filtered out as ambient sound ) . The Plantronics , due to a much shorter boom , does not . Inbound sound quality : Even raceIn both cases , you can hear your caller quite easily . Both include an inline control capsule that offers volume up / down / mute , although TheBoom requires you to hold the mute button , unlike the Plantronics unit , where you just toggle the mute off / on , then let go . Outbound sound quality : It depends .. Initially , TheBoom seemed to be a great option for me , since during the summer I literally take my office out to the back deck ( people used to complain about hearing birds in the background .. they 'd really be jealous if they realized I was holding conference calls in a bathing suit ) . Wind wasn't an issue , so no opinion there , but .. as time progressed , I began hearing complaints about static , which I attribute to the fact TheBoom cord requires two parts-one that runs from the headset to a connector , and a second that adapts the connector to my cordless office phone 's headset jack . Additionally , I often hear complaints that people can't hear me-if TheBoom slips even one iota out of the " sweet spot , " your voice is filtered out as ambient noise . Pretty tough to keep the mic exactly where it needs to be , not move around , and pray you 've conquered the static and loss of volume . For that reason , I 've gone back to the Plantronics unit , which sounds just as good , with greater consistency / reliability . Just means no more conference calls on the deck . ( bummer ) Construction quality : Plantronics wins ( hands down ) In under one year , I had to replace the sponge portion on TheBoom 's microphone , and am now replacing the soft rubber portion of the ear bud . Given the repeated complaints about static , I must also be sure the connection between the two parts of TheBoom cord is on a solid surface with no one as much as breathing in its direction . The Plantronics has never needed replacement or repair . Its shorter , single cord is ample for reaching between the headset and phone , and allows me to easily jack out if I need to leave the phone behind for a moment , with no major jack in production to get things lined up perfectly again ( as is always the case with TheBoom ) . Cost : Plantronics by farTheBoom is an investment that I 've come to regret . The Plantronics unit , on the other hand , could be replaced several times over , if needed ( although it 's given no indication it 's needed any time soon ) . So what if I have to step indoors for conference calls from now on ? Plantronics allows me to function easily the remaining 90 % of the time , which is more valuable to me than the birds . Plantronics wins .  
1	  This unit is difficult to set up . Auto config for speakers does not work . Manual is a joke . Sound quality is poor to bad . I would not buy another Onkyo product . I am back to Sony next time .  
1	  I liked this mouse and keyboard so much that I recommended it to a new co-worker who sits right next to me . All of a sudden , my mouse / keyboard didn't work when she was using hers .. they interfere with each other . I called Kensington tech support and it turns out they 're on the same frequency with no way to change it . You have to be 30 feet away from each other to avoid interference . How annoying is that ?  
2	  This is perfect ! I like it . I 'm not big on the arms so it fits just right . For big time body builders and really big people of course it will be a problem , but for anyone else looking for a replacement one besides the $ 25 apple one , this is not . No jokes , it 's like a waste of money buying the apple just because it has the logo . This will suit you just the same as the apple one ! Cheers ! Good shopping to ya all .  
1	  My dell Photo 964 and this server weren't compatible . I think it is my printer 's problem not the server 's .  
2	  Great Product . I ordered one for myself and then ordered one for the VFW Auxliary Kitchen . It is greatly appreciated to find a crockpot so large for home use .  
2	  I love this product so much ! I now bring this with me everywhere I go on my travel trips . OK so most people with updated laptops have either built in wireless , or a wireless card right ? Well what happens when you are in your hotel room ( that doesn't provide wireless access ) and they have an ethernet port in the wall , but you want wireless ? You use this clever piece of D-Link networking . When running in AP mode ( flip of a switch ) you can just plug it into an ehternet port on the wall and " broadcast " the info on that port . Then with your already wireless enabled laptop you can connect to this handy device and suddenly you are on the hotel 's network and the Internet ! Viola ! You can even have coworkers with you in the room sharing the one ethernet port wirelessly . Simple huh ? Well I do have to say that this little beauty is easy to work with , works well , has good enough range ( covers average hotel room ) , comes with a handy case , flat / easy to manage ethernet cable , and a quick install guide that was almost not even needed . I can't tell you enough how freeing this little device had made my travel trips . I hated having to string a long 9 ft ethernet cable from my laptop to the hotel wall . And on top of that the cable would be in mid air because my laptop was on a table or the bed and the ethernet port is high on the wall next to a shelf . Picture that if you will and then picture it without the wire ! I love it . <- period  
2	  Some discribe them as a little quiet , which I understand , but they are fine for me . The sound quality is suprisingly good at this low price .  
2	  As most of the other reviews state , this really is a 5 star keboard . I can find no fault with it other than it may possbily be TOO comfortable ! I purchased this keyboard for use at work as this is where 75 % of my computer usage occurs . It can take a little while to get used to if you 've never used an ergonomic keyboard in the past as the curvature and split key configuration is a bit different . Is just so happens that I 've actually been able to increase my typing and at the same time , keep my wrists and hands in a more natural position . Through dumb luck , I was able to get this keyboard for $ 22 from one of the independant sellers ( they changed the listing the day after I bought ) and I must say I would have paid $ 100 for this luxury .  
2	  I have only had this cable for about a week and so far I love it . It was very east to connect to my PC . It took about 3 minutes to connect and is pretty user friendly . I am what you would call computer / ti-89 illiterate . In other words , I am just learning , but I have had great success transfering files to both my PC from my calculator and visa versa . Also , it is pretty nice to see your calculator screen so clearly on your pc and to be able to use math fonts that I was never had access to before . I highly recommend just buying this cheaper cable if you only have a PC .  
2	  I am a mystery shopper and this is a great recorder . It is easy to use and it picks up voices from a pocket in my purse . I also use it with a microphone . You can file the voice recordings into different folders and the recorder is small so it is not obvious . I am very pleased with voice recorder .  
1	  Although I purchased a different unit , the GoVideo 8440 Portable DVD Player , it played exactly 6 movies before dying . GoVideo replaced it with a refurbished model , which arrived in non-working condition . I received a THIRD replacement unit ( new ) from GoVideo , which failed within minutes out of the box . Please note that I have since discovered that GoVideo Inc . is NOT a member of the Better Business Bureau of Central / Northern Arizona and has MULTIPLE complaints against the company . Purchase at your own risk !  
2	  I unpacked and connected to a pair of Bose 201 speakers .. sounds great ! Had to read the manual to figure out how to set presets and manually tune .. not hard . The sound is clean . I would have wanted phono inputs too , but hey theres only a few of us left . Otherwise , this seems to be well made and quite powerful . So far so good ..  
1	  There is a distinct tininess to the sound . It is definitely not of the Bose standard of sound quality .  
1	  Based on the very good performance of my old Zen Micro 6Gb ( still fully functional ) I purchased a Zen Microphoto for my daughter . It just died after about 6 weeks . I got it replaced . New one , same story . Did not want to have it replaced . Not worth it .  
2	  BUT ; U KANT TAKE THE DVDs U 'VE RECORDED ON THE SONY RDR-GX7 AND EDIT THEM IN YOUR PC . I DON'T KNOW , MAYBE I 'M USING THE WRONG SOFTWARE . MAYBE I 'LL TRY ADOBE LIVE MOTION INSTEAD OF SONIC 'S MyDVD SOFTWARE THAT CAME WITH MY SONY DRU-500A RW DRIVE IN MY PC . BUT EVEN WITH THIS LITTLE DRAWBACK , I JUST LUV THIS THING . I RECORD THREE SHOWS OFF OF TVLAND EVERYDAY WHICH IN TOTAL IS THREE HOURS LONG . I RECORD THEM EACH IN LP MODE AND MY PICTURE QUALITY STILL SEEMS HARDLY SACRAFICED . I BOUGHT IT IN MAY-2004 FOR $ 498 . IT SURE BEAT THE $ 799 PRICE TAG SONY HAD ON IT AT THEIR OWN WEBSITE . I WOULDN'T TRADE THIS THING FA NUTTN !  
2	  These headphones are of a very high quality and at a great price . Good selection of earbuds .  
1	  I purchased this item to allow me to watch my computer movies on TV for movie marathons etc , but it turns out that , while it can sustain sound , this cord is unable to transfer the S-Video signal to the yellow composite . In short , I have a sound cable , but the main part I paid for is useless . Unfortunately , I forgot to return it and now I 'm stuck with it . Get something that works !  
1	  If you are buying a new MAC do not buy this printer . This printer will not work with OS X Lion 10.7 . The driver is not available from Samsung and the Samsung help desk will not give a date when it will be available . I hope this review will encourage Samsung to develop a driver .  
2	  I am happy for my purchase on Amazon . It is nice product in the price range . Quality is amazing . I don't think we can get this item at this rate .  
1	  First , it 's a fifteen-cent piece of plastic that is way , way overpriced . Secondly , it doesn't work . It falls right off . Never mind arguing about a somewhat loose fit vs . a tight fit . This just DOESN'T fit , period . You put it on ; it falls right off immediately . Pathetic , and even if it actually did fit and stayed on the end of the filter , it would still be one of those egregious price-gouging rip-offs that are all too prevalent in photography equipment .  
2	  This book was exactly what I needed : a good introduction to Visual Basic and how to use it in Excel 97 . It assumes no prior VB experience , but it helps to have some programming experience to understand the vocabulary and concepts used . You will never be able to use Excel 97 to its full potential without knowledge of VB , trust me . I am continously amazed at the flexibility and power of Microsoft Office . This book allows Excel users to unlock this power . It should be noted that this book is not made as a reference , but as something to read from front to back .  
2	  I purchased a half-dozen of these to enable me to insert wide plugs and wall-warts into closely-spaced power strip outlets . Manufacturers often space outlets very close together in order to save money . These extension cords allow you to utilize all the outlets on a power strip . Despite being very inexpensive , they are made very well .  
2	  Ordered this monitor at night of 12/22/2005 using Free super saving shipping and received it in the morning of 12/24/2005 . Amazon shipped it with next day air ! And I would say this is a great monitor . Bright and crisp clear ! Amazon ROCKS !  
2	  I love my Franklin eBookMan 911 . Is it a perfect device ? No . Is it the best on-the-go ebook reader out there ? Absolutely . The screen is large , the two included eBook reading applications ( Franklin Reader and Mobi Reader ) are both very good ( albeit with different strengths ) . For a science-fiction fan , like myself , there 's lots of first-rate content available at electronic publisher Fictionwise ( award-winning real SF authors like Robert Silverberg , Isaac Asimov , and Harlan Ellison ) . The backlight is perfect for reading in bed while someone else is trying to sleep . I take mine everywhere .  
1	  I purchased one of these units along with two TF-S10 speakers from the same manufacturer . Less than 3 months after installing the product the paint is already chipping off on the TFS-50 . It has only rained one time and there are no sprinklers anywhere near the unit , so the paint is basically falling off without any provocation . When I inspected the unit after noticing the paint chips I tipped it slightly and a large amount of water came pouring out . Apparently it is not only not sealed against water intrusion but it also allows it to collect inside . Given the small amount of rain we get here it is surprising that any was able to collect at all . I attempted to return the unit for repair or replacement but the manufacturer insisted that I pay for the packaging and shipping . Given the size and weight of this object it is not worth my time to do this . I recommend avoiding this manufacturer entirely .  
1	  I own this camera . Nowhere does Sony tell you that this camera will only function reliably with sony discs . The manual only tells you it has to be an 8cm disc . When you turn the camera on ( after you buy it ) it will show " sony disc reccomended " on the screen , not required . After losing discs to access error messages ( this included my daughters sweet 16 party , an overseas trip and finally a vacation in the mountains ) I sent it in to sony . Sony sent it back stating nothing was wrong , but that sony discs had to be used to guarantee it will work ( stated nowhere on the box or manual ) . The sony discs are hard to find and more expensive than any other brand . Sony forces you to buy their discs after you 've bought the camera otherwise why not clearly state Sony Discs Mandatory on the box or handbook prior to purchase . They are ripping their customers off !  
2	  Got the usual excellent turnaround from Adorams ( 3 days ) . Remote is exactly what it says . Works great out of the box . Easy to keep in pocket for use when needed . Only down side is that it is so compact it would be easy to misplace ( not unlike the SD memory cards ) . It does have a little carry case , so that helps . Can't beat this for the money . I 'm surprised there are much more expensive remotes listed for the camera . Can't see what the use would be . Highly recommended .  
2	  I purchased this as a replacement for another portable iPod docking station / speaker system that died after three years of hard use . To my surprise , I liked this better than the previous one ! Here are the things I like about it : 1 ) It works great either on AC power ( 110/220 dual voltage , for those of you who may live overseas , this means no need for transformers , just a plug adapter to plug it in ) , or on 4 AA batteries . I bought rechargeable batteries and a small battery charger , which means no more batteries in landfills . * Note : it will only charge your iPod when plugged in to AC power . * 2 ) It 's fantastically portable . The information on Amazon 's website implies that this item weighs 4 lbs . - that MUST be a typo . This little unit is sturdy , but I doubt it even weighs a pound ! It 's excellent to pick up and carry from room to room when not plugged in to AC power . 3 ) It has great sound for such a small unit . I am not a connoisseur of speakers , but I am a musician and have my standards . The previous iPod speaker system had a noticeable ( and annoying ) hum whenever I plugged the iPod into the dock ( same iPod ) .. this one has NO annoying hum or buzz , and the sound is warm , pleasant and balanced sounding at both low and high volumes . Here 's the only drawback so far : since I use the blue LED light that indicates power ( either AC or battery ) is extremely bright ! I use the unit ( plugged in ) as a speaker system for my iPod Touch ( 1st generation ) along with a clock app , as an alarm clock .. but the LED light is so bright that I had to put a little square of black plastic electrician 's tape over it in order to darken it , because it was illuminating the bedroom so brightly that I couldn't sleep ! Overall , with the exception of the LED issue , this is a great unit and a great value for the price ! I 'd definitely buy again .  
1	  Avoid . I KNEW I should have bought the HK Soundsticks instead ! This is what I get for buying this POS .. Shipping [ not to mention packing ! ] to ship this back to the West Coast [ I 'm in Sucklanta ] for warranty service would be a PITA .. I guess I 'll just throw them in the trash :(  
1	  I had to try it out . I hear so much advertising and hype about Vonage . So , I went down to the local computer store and bought it took it home to set it up and problems right off the back . I have a 3mb DSL connection that is great . I used the temp number and started to make calls , the quality was poor . There was a echo and a delay that was very annoying , I would often talk over people . I tried it for the trial period and then returned it . I called their support and if I have to wait 20 miniutes forget it ! I tried 3 times and they lost a customer . I looked at other companies and found a smaller VoIP provider that is working great for me OurDigitalVoice . I called their tech support a 2 min wait and the people are friendly and informed . Vonage is just too big for their britches if you ask me !  
1	  My expectation , based on Elgato 's claims , was that this product would allow me to burn DVDs of comparable visual quality to commercial ones . When I first began using the product I wrote to Elgato to ask why the picture looked poor , and they expressly said it was " DVD quality . " I guess that doesn't mean what I think it means because , even at the highest quality , the final output looks poor when burned with Toast . The picture is laden with compression artifacts . My estimate is that a Wonder DVD looks inferior to an average VHS tape . Why is that the case ? Getting answers to that question or any other from tech support - which is only available online - is dicey . The techs are cordial but the responses are often unclear . One of them told me that I might be happier with another , more expensive , Elgato product if I wanted a better quality picture . Why do I need to spend more money if Wonder offers the elusive " DVD quality " ? Again I could make no sense of the explanation . Perhaps the higher priced product streams more data , but there is no clear explanation on the company 's website . It would be nice to ask directly , but Elgato doesn't even have a voice line for sales . I find it immensely frustrating to deal with a company whose tech support response is next-day , and whose answers are then often not on point . If you want visually mediocre DVDs this product will give them to you . It works and it is easy to operate . You just don't want to set your expectation too high , as I did . Update : Elgato has subsequently told me that the model 200 will not produce a better picture than Wonder on higher end Macs , one of which I have , so this is the best they have to offer . Further update : As of Sep 05 the product has new software problems . The screen goes white intermittently during a recording , and sometimes the recording hiccups . Elgato acknowledges and claims to be working on white screen issue . One more update : I 've purchased a component DVD recorder that is connected to a TV . The quality of recordings made on that device at SP and XP settings are FAR superior to the " DVD quality " produced by EyeTV Wonder .  
1	  We bought one of these units in July , 2005 and were thrilled with it . It was for the kids to use on car trips and to watch a kid 's movie that no one else wanted to watch . We were so pleased with it we bought another in October , 2005 so the kids would each have one to use . The second one has never worked , it read " No Disc " from the very start and since we were outside of our 30 day Amazon warranty we had to deal directly with Coby which took about 5 attempts before getting a response to return to them with a $ 6.00 money order to cover shipping , and also the requirement that we send it prepaid back to them . At the same time our other unit decided to act up . It would no longer play discs that it had once played , and surprisely won't even play new discs straight from the store . We get some " Pause , Error , Stop " spiel and the disc just whirls . It has also stopped playing midway on discs it starts to play . We discovered this wonderful feature on a 3 hour car trip , and it wouldn't play any discs no matter new or old . Sometimes it works , most of the time it doesn't . I contacted Coby and was told this one 's on me because it 's outside the 90 limited warranty and I 'm responsible for all shipping and repair costs . We had actually considered buying a Coby dvd-r recorder for our TV , but after all this elected not to even consider it again . It was reassuring to see that we are not the only ones that have had the same issues with their units . Too bad when I originally bought the first one there were only 2 very glowing reviews . Wonder if they still love their players ? Do your research on any portable dvd players and wait until there are at least 10 reviews to consider !  
2	  This UV filter produces high quality pictures at a fraction of the cost of many ather brands .  
2	  I had a Kensington bluetooth mouse with poor results so I was weary to take another chance on a bluetooth set , but i needed a wireless set with a range only bluetooth could provide . I have long been a fan of Microsoft peripherals so I took a chance on this bluetooth set and I 'm glad i did . The keyboard is one of the thinnest i 've ever seen , but doesn't feel cheap . The battery life is good and the mouse has a rechargable battery ( AA ) so it can be replaced . I have friends with bluetooth mice that have propiretary non replacable batteries . I love having the option of using the touchpad thats built into the keyboard and all the media center functions built into it makes viewing media on my Vista Ultimate machine a breeze . The only issue I 've experienced is that from time to time when my computer goes to sleep the bluetooth set wont wake it up . I think its a bios setting but ive found simply unplugging and replugging the reciever on the pc fixes the issue . Get this set , you 'll love it .  
2	  I 've been fooling with various cartridge-based printers for years , always saying someday I would get another LaserJet . I paid $ 3700 for my first one in the early Eighties . So I 've been thinking a laser would cost quite a bit more than the cartridge based printers . They do , but when you can buy a printer as good as this ML-2010 for about the same as a cartridge printer , there is no longer any reason to mess around . I 've had the printer for about three weeks . It installed effortlessly , operates effortlessly , produces beautiful results and is a joy to use . It has not caused the slightest problem . Mine is for home use and just may be the last printer I ever buy , unless at some point I buy a color laser .  
1	  The refurbished camera malfunctioned after only 3 uses . Since 30 days had passed , Amazon . com refused to refund our money . I understand that they state this in their policy , but why do they also not state that the refurbished cameras are basically junk that will malfunction after only a few uses . Our only option was to send the camera to the Nikon warranty center . This resulted in us not having the camera for taking pictures during a birthday party ( we 're still waiting to hear from Nikon about our camera ! ) . The aggravation and hassle of dealing with amazon . com and Nikon , plus the cost of sending the camera prepaid for service , plus not having the use of the camera during an important event are definitely not worth the savings in price . Lesson leant : Junk by any other name ( including " refurbished " ) is still junk ! Save your money and hassles - buy new .  
2	  I ordered the 1 ' cable , but received the 3 ' cable instead . Not a big deal . The cables worked just fine , connecting my home theater components to an ethernet hub . This was a great price and I 'd buy again without hesitation .  
1	  I purchased this product to replace a more expensive , but similar product that broke while packed in my suitcase on an airplane ( probably my fault for not packing it well ) . I opted to buy this as a replacement since it was cheaper and got good reviews , but I have been very disappointed . I guess you get what you pay for . I find this unit to be very cumbersome to use and it intermittently will stop working . Some days it simply won't work at all , and at first I thought the problem was the cigarette lighter in my car so I tested other devices in the cigarette lighter , and they all worked properly . So , I determined the problem is with this device . Also , everytime I go over a bump it simply stops playing music and I have to manually hit the play button on my ipod to get it to start again . And , when I go around a curve sometimes music starts only playing out of the the stereo on one side of my car , and I have to reposition my ipod onto the docking station to get it to play out of all speakers again . After two months of trying to get this product to work properly I have given up and ordered something different .  
1	  I bought this for my D40X a few weeks ago , and I have to say I 'm not impressed . The rubber is very restrictive , and doesn't really do anything but keep it from getting scratched . If you still drop the camera from eye-level the rubber " armor " will only keep all of the broken pieces of your SLR close together when it smacks into the floor , and by no means save your lens or camera from damage .  
2	  Two things I like about this cable . One is the price , which is very reasonable , and the other is the snag-proof end . The reason I needed to buy several is my old ones got snagged and broke off the arm . So far , the cables are working just fine .  
2	  I 've been using this camera for about a year and a half and have previously owned multiple point and shoot digital canon cameras . This camera allows a level of creativity unavailable with the other cameras . I have taken numerous pictures that people have asked " Where did you get that print ? " It is easy to use but has all the power you would expect from a SLR . I didn't buy the kit lens and opted for some higher quality lenses that have served me very well . Since others have listed pros and cons very well here are the highlights for me : Pros : SLR400 + shots on a single chargeFast shutter releaseExpandabilityCons : Doesn't fit in your pocket  
2	  Great features and flexibility , takes great pictures - it 's a wonderful camera for the money .  
2	  I looked at digital cameras for months - literally - before I just decided to lug around a 35 mm SLR . As everyone probably already knows , megapixels matter a whole lot when you 're talking about blowing a picture up to a larger size . What 's great about film is that unless the picture was taken out of focus , or in bad light , you can use a negative to blow something up and the quality really doesn't start to go down until you 're making HUGE prints . ( How huge exactly I don't know , but the biggest I 've blown up was around 4x4 feet , and still no trouble . ) The prints I 've gotten out of this camera so far have been stellar . ( I use fuji film - I think it 's better than Kodak , even though Kodak has better commercials . Give it a try ! ) The camera itself is not too heavy , granted , it 's not the convenience of a tiny digital camera , but it 's not as bad as I 'd expected to carry it around all day . The neck strap is nice , the manual is actually easy to comprehend . I like a camera that has buttons for a lot of it 's features on the body - it seems complicated at first , but once you know how to use the features , they 're much easier to access than they would be if you were scrolling through a menu . The T2 seems worth the hundred or so more dollars than you would pay for the very similar Rebel K2 by Canon . One thing - make sure you take the batteries out if you 're not going to be using it for a week or more . It seems like they go dead if they 're in the camera , even if it is off .  
2	  I purchased an extra EN-EL-3e battery for my Nikon 300D and am now using them both , one in the camera 's body and the other in the MB-D10 multi power battery back . Both batteries are working fine , hold a charge extremely well and recharge very quickly in the Nikon charger . I am considering the higher capacity battery , but will hold off as I don't feel like spending another $ 250 at this point for the additional battery capacity . I love this camera .. the absolutely best one I have ever owned . Nikon makes great stuff !  
2	  The iPod video is SO far greater than my iPod Nano ! It 's still the best for music listening , but the picture quality is outstanding and playback is easy . The games are awesome , too ! You won't regret buying one .  
2	  Sound is great .. even with original speaker wires .. we had to get different wires .. not long enough for our needs .. It 's true that you have to turn the volume almost all the way .. seems like something isn't right about that .. but once I changed the levels on the speakers .. it sounds fine .. True you will have to use coaxal or optical connections .. so if you just bought a hdmi cable thinking that 's all you need .. sorry .. My husband never hooked up anything like this before .. so it took him awhile to get it connected and working . Great bass quality .. made our kids jump the first time it kicked in during a movie .. again .. make sure you set your speaker levels and subwoofer level using the remote all explained in the manual .. not too hard to figure out .. Great value .. very happy with it ! Goes great with our Samsung 46 inch dlp tv ..  
1	  When I read the previous review about this thing skipping , I didn't pay too much attention because I intended to keep it on my kitchen counter . However , it skips while anyone walks anywhere near it . This is the most amazingly unstable CD player I 've ever seen . The best I can say for it is that with the right peripherals , it could be a nifty seismograph .  
1	  Great TV . Picture is awesome . Enjoyed it when it was working . Needed repairs at 15 months ( not under warranty ) Cost $ 700 . Needed repairs again for same issue at 18 months ( three months later ) . Another $ 700 projected . Decided to replace TV  
1	  Set up router it did not work . Called support and was given a runaround . This is the worst company to get support .  
2	  Sennheiser Rs110 926 Mhz Wireless Rf HeadphonesGood product . Sound is clear and handles outside interference well . One notable fault is that it is hard on standard AA batteries and suggest that rechargeable batteries be used with a spare set on hand at all times .  
1	  This product worked great for about a month , then it completely went dead , and was as worthless as the battery I replaced , giving you about 10 seconds before the machine totally shut off if you unplugged the AC . I called , and Tigerdirect said there was nothing they could do , but they instructed me on what to say to IBM Tech Support , regarding when I made the purchase and what not . The kicker is they wanted me to lie ! I stayed on the line while the TigerDirect person connected me with IBM , and made the introduction to the IBM Tech Support person , he gave them my laptop serial number , ( which should have nothing to do with warranty on an aftermarket battery ! ) and then turned it over to me , then dropped off the line ! I told the IBM person , who mind you knew everything about me from my serial number , that I was being asked to lie in order to cheat them out of a battery by a rep at TirgerDirect , I applogized on TigerDirect 's behalf and hung up . That was a $ 65 mistake !  
2	  I purchased some more expensive headphones that broke the first time I used them . I went with the Philips and they are great ! I love the fact that they fold up and also that they are large enough to cover your ears , helping to block out more sound . PLUS they are extremely comfortable . I would recommend them and for the price , it 's a deal ! The noise canceling feature worked well for movies , although , I would highly recommend a Boostaroo splitter / headphone amp . ( regardless of which headphones you choose . ) It lets up to 3 people share the sound source and amplifies the sound . Great for watching movies on an airplane . A normal splitter decreases the volume making dialogue difficult to hear .  
2	  I ordered my TV over the holidays . Delivery was perfect using Eagle and the set had no problems . Picture on both HD and 480i is beautiful . Using with a Sony upconvert DVD player with it which again provides a beautiful picture . Monitor converts flawlessly between video modes . Wide button on remote very handy for dealing with programs running on HD channels which are not in widescreen formatAlso have this hooked up to my laptop running at 1920 x 1080 resolution . Again , picture looks awesom . Don't regret order at all .  
1	  Drops connections as if it was it 's job . Horrid Support , Horrid website . It really is one of the worst peices of equipt that I have every used , truly awful . Stick to inferiour cell phones you assphats .  
1	  Bought from MarginMart . All Amazon reviews should begin this way , stating which seller the reviewer bought from . It 's especially important for things that don't have a brand name stamped on them . Like cables , adapters , and aftermarket printer cartridges . If all the 1-star reviews are from the same seller , then I can suspect that seller is probably shipping a different item , even if it looks the same . What I received looks like theEforcity HDMI-F to DVI-M Video Adaptor with Gold Contacts .  
1	  Here are some pluses : advantage of dvd on the fly . Reasonable picture quality . Amazing sound quality when original DVD is played back on a 5.1 capable DVD w / apropriate decoders in place . But .. reason for 2 stars : 1 . Poor image quality in other than perfectly lit scenes ( say in-door evening events vs . beach in full summer sun ) 2 . Sony claims to be able to get good image even in low light situations . True , but to the cost of losing color spectrum and fading the image sharpness . 3 . Editing software is downright childish . No use for someone willing to do more than point-shoot and play . 4 . Advice for more advanced users : file can be imported and edited in advanced editing software . I use Pinnacle Studio 10 Media suite and it works pretty nice . However , in this way the original 5.1 sound is lost and if you still want a 5.1 DVD , Pinnacle will do that for you but the sound will never have the same natural quality as the original . 5 . Noticed same problem as the guy returning from Alaska . With one little adjustment : camera goes out of focus even if recording from a tripod a semi-static scene ( say a choir ) for more than 5 minutes . 6 . Lack of any wind cancellation system is petty for a 1 grant camera . I also own a Panasonic VHS-C and a Panasonic mini-DV and their wind cancellation is outstanding . Lack of this function seriously spoils the otherwise exceptional sound system and renders it unusable without sound post-processing , for recording in the middle of the nature . 7 . Even though direct DVD recording compensates for lack of fire-wire port , one would have been nice , even instead the completely useless USB 2.0 . IEE1394 is the only port most processing applications accept for digital capture . 8 . Lack of a S-video port is another goof for a DVD recording camera . Bottom line : if you already got one , try getting used to it and you may need to invest extr-money in purchasing video editing software to make for the camera 's shortcomings . If you didn't , don't spend the money on it . This technology is still in its infancy and there 's lot of room for improvement .  
1	  The 90 day warranty is useless .. I don't know why Sylvania resells this junk .  
1	  I bought this lens and wish now I had not . I was looking for a real macro lens and with a focal point in macro of 37.4 it does not produce the photos I want . I saw no difference in the normal photos and ones with the macro switched on . It is alright as a general lens but don't expect the clairity and quality that you would get with higher end lenses . I 'd rate this ho-hum .  
1	  I 've had nothing but trouble with this router . It drops all the time and I have spent countless hours on the phone with their terrible offshore support . My issue always has to be given to a supervisor who is never available . They call me back ( sometimes ) at 10 p . m . CST instead of 8:30 a . m . CTS due to the time difference where the support is located . I have reset this more times than I can count and was told that the majority of my issues stem from the fact that my cordless telephones run on 2.4 gig as does the router and they interfere . ? All I can tell you is no more NetGear for me ! This one 's going in the trash even though I 've got the " free " support , it costs me about 2 hours a week and that 's more than I can afford .  
2	  This is my first Panasonic camera so I am coming to this completely objectively . People seem to be divided into two groups regarding the FZ50 ( and by extension , most of Panasonic 's recent digicams ) - those who find it 's image quality impressive despite it 's limitations and enjoy it 's superiority in most other areas and those who feel the FZ50 should have been a lot more than it is , lacking the output to back up it 's DSLR stylings and not being a revolutionary upgrade over the FZ30 . I stand somewhere in the middle but leaning more towards the first view . The fact is , the FZ50 is a great bridge / mega zoom all-in-one digicam . The huge 12x focal range really is liberating and I just could not go back to a measly 3x zoom ever again . The superior quality of the Leica lens , which really is the main selling point is not to be underestimated - it 's very sharp , producing next to no chromatic aberrations with truly effective stabilisation and I think is far superior to the lens of current competition . As everyone points out , to get this quality of ( stabilised ) lens over such a huge focal range for a DSLR would usually require more than one bulky lens and would probably cost well over a $ 1000 , so you can't really find anything to grumble about here . I absolutely love the manual zoom and focus , which means you can fine tune to a degree that you just couldn't with a mechanical zoom - it 's also silent and saves valuable battery power . I 've found colour representation in the photos to be realistic although I must say that on every digital camera I 've used , photos have never appeared quite how my eyes saw the original scene colour wise . I 've found auto white balance to do a good job in most situations so far and this can also be fine tuned when in manual mode . The flash output can also be set to varying degrees , which is useful when you want to retain a more natural look in dimly lit conditions . The ergonomics as everyone points out are also great , the FZ50 feels comfortable and your hand position will feel natural around it . The flexibility of the twist out and swivel LCD screen is also not to be underestimated , allowing more versatile shooting angles than a fixed screen would give you . I really wish the screen could have been bigger though - I 'm sure Panasonic could have extended it to 2.5 " as there is a border around the screen which could have possibly been used up with extra pixels . However , the screen is great . At 207K pixels , everything is nice and sharp and there is no ghosting unless in very dim light . I am a little confused though as even though the EVF has a higher resolution than the LCD screen at 235K pixels , it is very noticeably less detailed in both colour and sharpness - can anybody enlighten me by leaving a comment ? And so we come to image quality - the real bone of contention between the two camps . I have to say that I agree with a lot of those who complain about Panasonic 's decision to up the pixel count from the FZ30 to 10mp whilst still using the same sized sensor , which is a fraction of the size of a DSLR . The ( now infamous ) Venus 3 engine covers the noise well but as others will point out , at the cost of smudging out fine detail . Unfortunately , when Panasonic in their FZ50 press release said that high ISO noise levels were much improved over the FZ30 , they didn't quite mean they had made a breakthrough with sensor technology , they simply meant they had developed a better way to hide the noise ! Having said that , my photos have really impressed me with great clarity and colour and the main digicam review sites have pointed out that the image quality is above average in this anyway superior class of consumer digicam , and you can see this from their test shots . Also , if you go onto some of the Panasonic forums such as at dpreview you 'll find some great examples of what can be achieved with the FZ50 and I 'm sure you 'll be really impressed . And at low ISO 100 , some comparison tests show the FZ50 to give lower end DSLR 's like the XT a good run for their money ! But you do have to ask what is the point of putting in 10 megapixels if you have to print and view at sizes that a lower megapixel count would give you because when viewed at 100 % , the effects of the heavy noise reduction can look pretty ugly . I would have much preferred a 6mp FZ50 if that would have resulted in less noise for the Venus 3 to work with . If I 'm right in saying that a larger sensor would then result in a smaller focal range then Panasonic have probably tried to get the best from all angles and successfully so - however , Fuji have shown that great strides in sensor technology can be achieved . To conclude , the FZ50 is a great advanced digicam and really impresses in all areas . It 's a lot of fun to use because it 's so comfortable and makes such a wide range of shots possible not to mention being extremely responsive and quick . The effects of the heavy noise reduction will only be an issue if you plan on viewing and printing large and using the high ISO 's but otherwise image quality is great . For the advanced consumer who wants the best there is before the expense and bulk of a DSLR , then the FZ50 is the one to choose .  
2	  Sony earphone are very nice to use . I bought the product from amazon , after reading the customer review , I bought this product . The only disadvantages I found from this product is the wire length is too long and they have a connector which was connected to it , So basically the wire length will became longer . The sound quality is very nice .  
2	  Great card , just brand spanking new , works perfect for my camera ! Thanks for a great sale !  
1	  I purchased this product from amazon . com . I expected that Epson could provide a good product when it comes to scanner . The scanner arrived , and I was excited about it . After installing the software and seeting up the scanner , I scanned my first picture . The scanned result looks like it had specks of dust and scratches in the image . I scanned the same picture in a diferent position in the scanner , and I got diferrent results . It still had spots and scratches in different places . Called Epson and their answer was that the picture was deffective . They sent me to an Epson Service center , and the scanner spent a week in repairs . At the end nothing was acomplished . I had to return the scanner to amazon . com . I am looking for a new scanner . I hope Epson improves it 's customer service department ; it is worth nothing when it comes to trying to help a customer . The Epson service rep was always blaming the end user . He never considered the possibility that the scanner could be deffective . I will be browsing thru amazon . com trying to find a good scanner again .  
1	  The printer and scanner work just fine . However , the color ink tanks either dry up quickly or you have to use them up quickly . This would not be a problem except the color tanks must be in operation to print black and white ! So if you want to print black and white documents , you must spend $ 50 every 3 months for the color ink cartridges too . You also cannot simply fill the cartridges because the ink tanks have a special chip on them to make sure you use the " right " ink tanks .. Cannon . Basically , you spend 2-4x as much on Cannon ink tanks as you did for the printer . And that 's just annually . So don't buy it unless you 're printing mostly color photographs ..  
2	  The HDMI cables are great and of course is excellent when adding them toyour components .  
1	  So far usuless , didn't work on any eletronic I have . Tested on dvds , blu-rays , receivers , tv , nothing .. maybe I got a defective item .  
2	  Have not had it long enough to judge dependability , but works great for what I needed it for . Slapped an old laptop hard drive in it , now I have an external portable drive . I don't like the cable that comes with it , but hey , it 's cheap and it works great .  
1	  Does not fit my needs . Does not support devices that use serial ports like mice or other non simple devices .  
2	  Pros : works with FLAC and other formats through USB portflexibility with multiple inputs , headphone jack , and volume controlpowered through UniLink connectionCons : awkward to mountwon't allow clock to display when in useUSB port disconnecting when other inputs are used may cause computer software to misbehaveThe USB port is the main reason I wanted to get this box instead of the off brand cheaper versions . I was happy to see it installed as USB speakers without additional drivers on the two XP laptops I tried . What this means to me is that audio formats are being decoded on the computer , not the XA300 , so you can use whatever audio format you like , for me , FLAC . Using the USB port should alleviate concerns of cheap , noisy analog circuitry in your computer , likely a laptop for your car , which has fewer options for a nice sound card . However , on the laptops I tried , the sound was very good when using the laptop headphone jack output and the analog input of the XA300 . When switching through the inputs on my CDX-C6850 , the USB port disconnects when it is not selected , which causes an interruption on my media software . Even when I switch back to the USB input on my stereo , the music will not start playing until I restart my media application on the computer . On one of the laptops I tried , the disconnecting USB port would require a media software restart when quickly turning the ignition key from " on " back to " accessory " , such as when turning off the engine but wanting to hear the stereo . On another laptop I tried , this was not a problem . Regardless of the display mode on my stereo , the clock will not show when using one of the XA300 inputs . Some aspects of the XA300 make it seem like it was not well thought out . It is primarily needed to activate the auxiliary inputs on Sony car stereos , but it is too large to mount hidden away for some cars , and the included cable is too short ( about six feet ) to put the XA300 in the trunk . There is a volume control on the front , making it seem like the XA300 should be accessible and visible , yet the only mounting hardware included was velco strips , which isn't an attractive way to mount something that can be seen .  
2	  I RECEIVED THESE AS A GIFT , THEY ARE AWESOME , BEST QUALITY , BEST SOUND , HIGHLY RECOMMEND !  
2	  it works as a splitter is supposed to , can't complain , if you need a splitter , then what else can you ask for ?  
1	  I agree with the reviewer that says this thing smells toxic , like gasoline mixed with tar mixed with other nasty chemicals . It 's the " rubber " parts that stink . I have no idea how it performs as a tripod .. I 've already thrashed it ; it 's not even worth returning for the price paid . I don't see how some of this toxic crap gets into the market . I bought a tape measure with a rubber grip ( not from Amazon ) that had similar odors and I trashed that thing as well . These tripods seriously stink up the whole room . Some people must be more sensitive that this type of odor than others or this product would be all zeros and removed from the market .  
2	  I received the phone as promised . I really like using it for a small business that I operate out of my home . I too find that the buttons are hard to read without glasses ( maybe getting too old ? ) . Also , the fact that the phone hangs up if you place it back in the charge base is a pain . And for someone with larger hands like mine it 's cumbersome to remove it from the charge base . Other than that , I really like the sound quality and reception . Additionally , the headset is extremely comfortable and that 's really good since I use the phone for hours at a time . Bottomline - buy it .. it 's a great value for the money !  
1	  Within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob . It became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes . I send my camera to Nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem . Worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty ! They wouldn't repair my camera unless if I pay $ 100 for parts ( ? ) and labor ! It is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because Nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .  
2	  Usually , when I buy a bag like this , I find that the promise is greater than the product . However , this is one case where the product is better than the promise . The product has two padded pockets , which is ideal for my netbook and the separate keyboard I carry with it . There is also a multitude of other pockets and places that are both useful and handy to use . As others have noted , the construction is top-notch . A niggle : The carrying strap is slick and kept sliding off my shoulder . However , adding a shoulder pad took care of the problem . I added this pad , which is a perfect fit : $U$  
2	  This is the second time I bought this product . This time I bought two because the sound was good with a nicer mid range and a slightly better bass than my stock Apple earbuds . They definitely fit better with a choice three inserts to help seal in good sound at a lower volume to hear more tones . I like them due to the low profile size that lets me lay on my pill without them pushing into my ears . They also look nice too and I recommend them if you 're tired of regular Apple ear buds falling out of your ears frequently .  
1	  Had mine for about six weeks . I found it broken on the floor of my car one morning . When securing the unit , a significant amount of force is needed to turn the lever to adhere the suction cup to the glass . This amount of force is apparently to much for the main frame and over time .. device failure . The gps unit was not mounted at the time so no additional weight contributed to the mounting bracket failing . Seems like a weak design .. until some manufacturing changes are made to make it stronger I can't say I would recommend this product .  
2	  I had a pair of these previously , and loved the comfort and sound quality . The only problem was that after a year and a half of ungentle use , the rubber housing on the wires was shredded pretty badly . The sound hadn't deteriorated at all , however . I ordered a replacement pair ( for the price and quality , I figured it was worth it ) . To my delight , the second pair are every bit as great as the originals , but Sony 's changed the sleeves for the wires to one that is a little less flexible , but seems to be far more durable . If they do wear out again , I 'll most likely be replacing them with the same kind . I had to get used to the style of cord-I wear it under my shirt going down my back so my mp3 player rests in my right pocket . I find I can do just about any activity this way , and the cord doesn't get in my way .  
2	  Item was as listed . Makes controlling video camera mounted to a table very easy and stable . Recommend this to anyone using a camera on a tripod .  
1	  The itrip mini does what it advertizes : fits the sleek lines of the mini ipod without adding much bulk at all , and transmits your tunes to a radio tuned to frequency ( defaults to 87.9 , but you can adjust that by installing the simple software provided with the itrip ) . Living in LA , there are VERY limited options insofar as stations not in use . 87.9 is actually one of the few options . The sound quality was awful . I tried using this device in my car , in my room , in my home stereo - all with the same lousy results . I should have listened to the advice of the salesperson at the Apple store and gotten the cassette device to play my ipod music on other sound systems . Bottomline : it works , but sounds like music playing on a radio station that doesn't quite come in clearly - static . Poor volume , and very poor sound quality .  
1	  I bought this product on April 4 , 2008 and the features are very nice . I had no trouble connecting ' bluetooth ' devices and setting destinations without reading the manual ( since you have to print the 100 page MioMap manual and the 100 page hardware manual . BUT , I cannot find my way home ! I have lived in a relatively new house for 3 1/2 years and my street does not appear on the maps . Checking , I find the maps on my NEW Mio C520 are dated 2006 . I can understand that but also would expect the manufacturer to provide the latest version of the maps for free . From here on , I would expect to pay for map updates . I have contacted Mio several times since I purchased the C520 and there is a new map ( July , 2007 ) . Unfortunately Mio expects me to purchase the update . Sorry Mio , it 's being packaged up and returned . Before I purchased the Mio I used a few Garmin 's and found my address in each case . If your looking for good design and features I 'd recommend this device but if you 're looking for GPS Navigation you better keep looking . SO be prepared if you purchase this very nice piece of hardware with nice features , the most important thing you bought it for is outdated . Ron  
1	  .. and buy a GPS instead . I agree with previous reviewer ( Dave57 ) , I WOULD NEVER BUY A SUUNTO AGAIN . Worst than Dave , I simply got caught in heavy rain during a hike and my Vector was full of water , couldn't even tell the time . I send it to Suunto Finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and " kindly " offered a repair for 140 Euros .  
2	  It is what it is . Instant code for Microsoft points . Email was sent right after i confirmed payment . My friend had to gave me this after losing a game of Full house Poker on XBL . he bet me 4000 microsoft points that he would beat me . he lost :)  
2	  External hard drives can be so delicate and it 's important to my peace of mind to spend a little bit more to protect it even if it spends its entire life in a desk drawer and rarely travels ( we 'll see ! ) . This case is good durable quality which is not too soft at all and I trust it with my data . The magenta is a chill color .. something to be said for adding a dash of personality to a pretty standard thing . Fits the Toshiba 320GB HDDR320E04XW nicely with no complaints . All my drive needs is one little USB cord so it fits snug in case 's mesh pocket . Happy stuff .  
1	  This thing sucks ! I used it for a few years until one day the combination changed . I wish I 'd read the reviews on here before I purchased this piece of crap . Like someone else I just banged the crap out of it until it broke . thankfully Dell makes such a good computer that a few bangs did no damage . I HATE YOU TARGUS !  
2	  Great little case for the price . My Canon G12 with strap , extra SDHC flash card , extra battery , and Rocketfish card reader fit in like a glove perfectly . Good quality and came on time . I would buy this product again .  
1	  What a nightmare from the start . d link technical support is a joke , they are as slow as this router . Darn thing is less than 2 yrs old and it has never worked right . After 6 hrs on the phone with d link tech support the router is now slower than ever worse than before my call . They say it is defective . Really .. well duh of course it is out of the 1 yr warranty even though tech support said it has a 3 yr warranty . Buy anything else and stay away from d link unless you want to be frustrated and working at a snails pace .  
1	  I had this camera for less than 2 months , when it slipped out of my hand and fell about 2 feet to a carpeted floor . The lens became stuck out , and I couldn't turn it on anymore . I sent the camera back to Canon , and even though IT IS still covered by warranty , they want to charge me $ 138.19 to fix it ! It 's obviously a very fragile camera . It breaks INCREDIBLY easily , and they are not willing to fix it for less than 1/3 of what you would pay to buy it brand new . Very disappointing !  
1	  This product arrived scratche and the customer service would do nothing about a replacement . They have ignorged emails and phone calls and refuse to a ) take the product back for a refund , or b ) replace the product with a non-defective case . I would not recommend getting one of these cases and definately not through antonline . com  
2	  THE BEST PART THE PROTECTORS ARE EASY TO APPLY . NO MORE FINGER PRINTS OR SMUDGES .  
1	  The first one didn't work so we called the seller , who told us to call Sony to fix it . The next day I called and talked to a different person who said send it back for a replacement so we did . After two weeks with no word we emailed twice through Amazon with no replies . Finally we called the seller to see if they got it ok . A week after the call the replacement came with a little sticker telling us not to return it to them . This one records fuzzy and to eject a tape we have to manually open the little door . We 've had really good luck with Amazon sellers in the past , but we won't buy from World Wide Distributors again .  
2	  Needed another article and this item added enough to make the shipping free . Well packaged and defect free .  
1	  A " birdie " is a spurious signal generated within the radio , such that this signal can be heard by the radio . In this case , the 18WXSTII has one channel that seems like it always has a signal on it , and that signal is the birdie . I think it was channel 4 . The birdie signal was loud enough that it would block out any medium or weak real signals . Now , in other wide-band general-coverage radios that use synthesized frequency generation , it is common to hear a few birdies . But , since CB only uses 40 channels , you 'd think they could design it so that there would not be any birdies on those frequencies . When I talked to the Cobra technical support person , he admitted the birdie was a design problem and all the units have it . This was several years ago . It may be fixed by this time . Anyway , the tech agreed to exchange the radio , and I ended up getting a slightly more expensive model . I was happy with their support but sad about their design problems .  
1	  Hooked up the speakers and plugged it in . Standby lite came on . Turned the power on , unit played for 15-20 seconds then reverted to standby . Disconnected speakers , same thing happened . Called Sherwood ( it was not easy to reach them ) . Was told I should be using 16 ohm speakers . Nothing about that in the specs . Two service repair centers listed on their website . Called both , neither knew anything about Sherwood . Returning it to Amazon in exchange for another brand .  
2	  Hi : I 'm using this with a Treo 750 - first with WM5 , then I upgraded to WM6 . As piece of hardware that does what it says it does , it really should be five stars . At home it gives we a wireless connection to my network with very little hassle . I didn't plan on using a data connection for my phone much , and thought I could use this at hotspots instead of incurring cellular data charges . With respect to fulfilling my need with the Treo , it falls short of my expectations ; though this is definitely more related to my specific needs and perhaps my chosen PDA than quality of the WIFI card . I 'll share them here , to possibly help out any Treo 750 users making a decision . I also use my Treo for music and audio books - swapping out the memory card with the WIFI card , and properly storing ( and not loosing ) the unused card became a little bit of a hassle . And as you probably already know , the WIFI card sticks out and holds the phone 's card cover open . Also , when the phone went to sleep , I would often loose the WIFI connection and have to soft reset . I tried it at two free hotspots - Caribou Coffee , and within a city that offers free WIFI . The card found the connection as it should . But both services required me to log in on a web page after making a connection , but the web page did not automatically load in the mobile Explorer browser , as it does on my notebook computer . I did some Internet searches to try and figure this out , but haven't come up with anything yet . Yesterday , I signed up for an unlimited data package with ATT , and will probably no longer use the card , unless I someday have the time to figure out how to get it to work at hotspots . One other note - my phone carrier would really rather I buy a data service , and some of the preprogramming of the phone seems intent on making another connection more difficult . For example , under Proxies , ATT is checked , and unless , like me , you do an Internet search to find out you have to uncheck this box to connect elsewhere , you 'll go no where . Also , when I set up an email account , the set up strongly recommended I use the preset SMTP ( send mail ) servers through ATT . I still put in my own with no troubles , but if I used ATT 's I 'm guessing sending mail wouldn't have worked through a different connection . Well , that 's my $ 0.02 . Hope it helps you make a better buying decision .  
2	  Its Awesome routerI had the older ver of this router the one without the SpeedBooster and it was giving me lots of probs , I had it installed at the first floor , and wen I take my laptop downstairs which is less then 20 meters away the signal gets really week and indicates " Low " and the internet get slow as well , I though of buying this router , I did , I have it installed at the same place where I had the old one installed , and I didn't believe it I take my laptop anywhere in the house and the signal is good , I recommend it to yo guy to use it specially its affordable . Thank you  
2	  I received this unit yesterday . It came in a long box . The arm is well made and very durable . The wing to tighten and loosen is easy to grip and again well made . Metal where it counts . It 's not heavy and fits into some of the bags I already own for c-stands , etc . I would definitely recommend it . Awesome product .  
1	  Four problems : ( 1 ) the product did not include the 9-to-25-pin adapter shown in the picture ; ( 2 ) the included driver did not work , though one downloaded from the manufacturer 's web site did ; ( 3 ) I paid for next-day service but waited about one week for shipment ; ( 4 ) the product has integral female-threaded bolts that prevent use unless the mating DB-9 female adapter is flush with its mounting surface . The unit with which I wanted to communicate it also has projecting female-threaded bolts projecting from its mounting surface . Hmm . Removing the bolts from my unit loosens its DB-9 connector so that 's no go . And , it doesn't appear possible to non-destructively remove the bolts from the product . So , in my application , a DB-9 male-female adapter was required . I don't expect to have to purchase an adapter in order to use an adapter .  
1	  Work for about 20 minutes and than did not work again . I think it was a dud and would never purchase again .  
2	  All I wanted were replacements for my 15 year old , blown out stock speakers . I couldn't asked for more with these . Installation was easy , and this sound coming from them , though not audiophile quality , is leagues better than 80 % of the stock speakers I 've heard on brand new cars . If all you want are replacements , don't hesitate !  
1	  I bought these for my boyfriend to take to football games . They are not high quality whatsoever , which I was expecting by the price , but they didn't even seem to focus for him . I think this would only be a good gift if they were a stocking stuffer for a young kid wanting to play in the woods or something .  
1	  I bought because it was cheap , but it didn't last long and I think it gunked up the heads . Got rid of the Lexmark , when I found a good deal on a brother laser printer at Walmart  
2	  Ok .. I spent entirely too much time determining which Palm was right for me . I ended up purchasing the M125 ( from Amazon ) and don't regret the purchase . It 's great carrying the Palm vs . my old Franklin Planner ( a . k . a " male purse " .. as described by my wife ) . For those of you on the fence trying to determine whether you should by the M100 , M125 or the higher end M500/505 's here 's what I considered .. If you ABSOLUTELY only need the Palm for light use and don't care about additional memory or have an affinity for games , add-on 's , etc .. then purchase the M100/105 . If that isn't the case , you 'll pitch it or have given it away .. because you will have run out of memory by the end of the year ( and it isn't upgradeable ) . The M125 is great buy because you get much of the M500/505 functionality at a lesser price , plus you have the ability for the expansion card - for more memory , games , etc . The only thing I 'm not crazy about is that the meeting reminder " dings " pretty loud . So if you 're in a meeting it can become annoying listening to the reminder ( along with the cell phone , pagers , etc ) . I believe the 500/505 has a vibrating option . Also , the 500/505 have rechargeable batteries , so you don't have to keep replacing batteries - there 's pro 's and con 's on both , I suppose it depends whether you travel a lot . So , other than the " cooler " look , battery functionality and vibrating option that comes with the 500/505 , for me .. the M125 was a great a buy . Regarding the cradle .. if you 're on NT at work , get ready to purchase the serial cradle , since the USB won't work . On the upside , I use the USB cradle at home . Before you make a decision , be sure to check out Amazon 's comparison table - which enables you to line up each product that you 're considering .. it 's extremely helpful . One note - if you believe that you 'll buy a lot of the Palm accessories , I would do it with your initial order . You 'll save shipping $ , probably get a pretty competitive price and not have to pay sales tax ( and no , I don't work for Amazon ) . Good luck !  
2	  Really good video . The installation was easy , but the settings took me a long to do it right . The only reason I gave 4 is because the manual , which you have to download from the Internet , is a little confusing . You really have do dig in to find how to make the video do what you want . I still have to read more in order to understand more about the video board . However , I am really satisfied with the performance of the board . Maya runs smoth and clean . The great news is that it works on Linux too . Great product .  
1	  The product I received is defective . When a plug is inserted into the outlet it is so tight it pushed the contacts down into the unit so they do not work . Can it be exchanged ? Thxdave stroble  
2	  I was skeptical when I purchased this printer but it " ROCKS " that is for sure ! The unit is big and heavy but everybit worth it in my opinion .. Also the free photo software that comes with the unit is easy to use and has quite a few features for editing your pictures .. Note : The printer needs a high speed USB cable ( NOT INCLUDED ) or a wireless bluetooth unit BU-20 ( ALSO NOT INCLUDED ) adaptor to work with your PC !  
2	  mostly everything about this wireless headset for TV is as advertised EXCEPT that when I received it they now say that you need to buy new earpiece covers and change them every few weeks . they should have included silicone earpieces with the unit instead of , or in addition to the cheap foam rubber ones that come with the unit .  
2	  I purchased this product for my husband 's birthday . We really like it . It has tons of features and once you read the manual is very easy to use . Would highly recommend .  
2	  This the second of these devices I 've bought . Been using the first one to send our cable box output via coax to tv 's in different parts of the house whenever we wish to view the tv 's in those rooms thus eliminates need for a tuner in each room . Has been working well thru walls and floor . Will do similar with this one .  
2	  Great product , strong , durable - at first was a little difficult to open ( cover from base ) , but once you get the hang of it , it becomes manageable . Make sure to press the button to assist with opening it .  
1	  This antenna has a 100 mile range per the technical specifications . All stations are less than 50 miles from my home . I got only one station out of 30 or so I was supposed to get .  
2	  We have not had the cover very long , so I will update as wear and tear start . But so far it seems much better than previous covers . Lots of other covers have cracked in the winter , and this one has held up well so far this winter . It doesn't go all the way to the ground , so on really windy it days , it does start to blow up , and could potentially blow off . It has handled rain and snow well so far , and doesn't feel as stiff ( brittle ) in the cold as previous covers . The material is thick and hopefully will last long . The colors are nice , but that part wasn't critical to me . We 'll see if they fade with time . Overall , it is my favorite cover to date .  
1	  This is the first Ipod I bought , and I also have an older style Creative zen touch . First let me say that this is a pretty nice product , but it is WAY to flimsy . This product is not durable , I 've only had it about a month and there are scratches all over it ( though I keep in the case most of the time ) , and if I press on the bottom it makes a clicking noise ( not from the wheel ) For the upsFirst , I was really excited to get a smaller skinnier player , because the creative one is NOT skinny at all ( thing is freakin huge ) . Second I love the 2.5 " screen , it is very prettyThird , I love that it can play videos . Now for the things I don't like .. I HATE the itunes program , it may be my computer ( p4 , 2.6gh , 1.5gb ram ) but it is extremely choppy and takes forever to load the music store ( I run dsl , not dialup ) Second , the thing scratches SO easily , I 've been lucky and the screen doesn't look all that bad , but the rest is another story . ( its from going into my pocket , I usually keep the case on but not always ) All though I do know I have to be more careful . Third , I 'm sure the little clicking on the bottom is just my model , but it sure does bug me . And yes it has been there since i bought it . Fourth , I can't use the videos on my computer without buying quick time pro , and I just wasted $ 300 so I am a little short on money right now , looks like the free podcasts will have to do until i find an alternate way . Fifth , I couldn't beleive it , but the sound quality actually sucked compared to my zen touch . Even with the EQs the same , the creative still sounded better . That is what I think , I wish I would 've invested into a better player , but I thought this was supposed to be the best . Though I do like it , I think I would 've been happier with a newer creative product .  
2	  The Gefen DVI splitter is a 1:2 DVI distribution amplifier . It is meant to split a DVI output into 2 . Unlike some other splitters , the Gefen has a feature where it " clones " the attributes of the primary display so that , to the computer , the gefen will appear as if it was just this display . Other splitters merely pass thru the lines that identify the display , and this works most of the time , but not always , at least it didn't with my Radeon graphics card , which would fail to properly identify the display thru a passive splitter upon boot , yet worked flawlessly if the splitter was plugged in after a monitor had been plugged in and identified . The gefen splitter 's ability to clone display attributes solves this problem . However , you HAVE to read the instructions to get it to work right , because it is not fully automatic . This splitter creates a copy of those attributes at the moment it is powered up , so you have to have the primary display powered on and connected to output 2 BEFORE power is applied to the splitter . This may be why some users have some confusion . As far as its ability to drive displays over extended lines , the gefen is a video amplifier but it is not claimed as an extender , at least at the time of this writing , it will power lines as long as the cables you can power with any other output . In my case it is supplying a samsung LCD panel as well as a projector over a 25 foot long DVI cable , and it works great .  
1	  This card is not compatible with 1.0 compliant AGP . The confusing thing is you think 2.0 compliant is 2x , it is not . I called costomer service before buying this card . I had asked if 2.0 compliant was the same as 2x , she said ' right ' , that 's was her only word ! She odviously didn't know what she was talking about . I like Creative products , it 's not that , I have the SBLive X-Gamer and it 's excellent but I bought my PC only last year and this Anhilator 2 should be compatible with 1.0 slots but it isn't . Most other top of the line cards ( Voodoo 5 ) are 1.0 compliant and AMD super7 compatible . I give it an extra star because it is said to be good on 2.0 AGP systems . No stars on mine because it doesn't work .  
2	  I got this with my keyboard & it came in very handy . :) Definitely worth the few bucks extra . ALWAYS PROTECT YOUR ELECTRONICS !  
2	  I was scared to order a tv on line , but the experiece was great . They called ahead & in my area even delivered it on a Saturday . Using Amazon I saved hundreds of dollars instead of going to Best Buy or Circuit City who were way over priced . So if you are worried about it don't be unless you hate saving money . As far as the TV it has great picture & plenty of A / V jacks for all your toys .  
2	  Awesome product . Did loads of antenna research , and these guys had a great price . Construction is easy , though it doesn't come with coax , like others do . put it where my old Direct TV dish was , pointed it in the other direction and tapped into existing coax . Crystal clear HD . Tried the Philips one from Wal-Mart , but I took it back cause it screwed up a bunch . The instruction manual has some great advice too : Do not install if pregnant , drunk , or both . Do not throw at spouse . Classic . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED . Live in St . Louis 25 miles from HD towers ( Fenton area ) . Beautiful , and FREE ! , HD ( all channels on my new TV .  
2	  I tried the off brand one for 40 bucks and it locked on my 30d to the point I had to destroy it to get it off . the canon one is weather sealed and double locked like the 580ex II flash . it works great .  
1	  Ordered it a month ago and still haven't gotten it and they ask me for a review . Not sure what they want me to say .  
1	  My paycheck is based on how fast I type while retaining quality . With the spacebar wearing out on my old faithful ergo-friendly split keyboard , I was out to find at least an equal , if not better , replacement . When I saw this keyboard I was so excited by the design , I hardly even blinked at the significant price but now wish I had . The 1 star I gave this keyboard was for the ability to adjust the height and tilt - that aspect is fantastic and proved VERY comfortable , although it is a little awkward to adjust ( I 'm right-handed but the adjustment lever is on the left so I found it difficult to hold the keyboard in the position I wanted it while trying to lock the hand into place ) . Unfortunately , it did not make up for the other problems such as : 1 . After having used this keyboard for only 12 days , keys began to stick . The left-sided shift and Ctrl keys are continuously sticking . ( With the very short 10-day return policy , I 've now lost over $ 100 . ) 2 . The keys are very stiff and again , after using it for a time , they actually seem to get stiffer and tighter . They are to the point that the extra comfort I gained by the adjustable height / tilt is completely blown away by my aching fingers from having to press so hard on these keys . Though I prefer an extremely light touch , I have worked on firm keyboards and never had a problem . However , this one is so tight , I feel as though I am forcing the keys down and frequently miss letters because I didn't hit them hard enough ( and " hit " truly is an accurate description ) . 3 . Pressing a key at an angle ( for example , doing the 1-finger typing and reaching to the opposite side of the keyboard while it is tilted away from the approaching finger ) will not always make contact to type the letter . I have even deliberately pushed keys down with my finger slightly off-center and , on certain keys , it will not type until I slide my finger to the center of the key . 4 . The extra keys ( delete & extra backspace ) are poorly positioned . They are terribly uncomfortable to use with even minor frequency . It 's not that hard to get used to their location and I quickly became used to the new location of the other extra keys ( home , end , page up / down keys , arrows ) . The problem simply is that having to use the delete key by using the left little finger is actually uncomfortable and even interferes with typing if you use special combination command keys ( i.e. , Ctrl + Del ) . 5 . Not having the " calculator " number pad is more bothersome than I would have expected . It 's not a hidden problem when purchasing this keyboard and the buyer is made aware of it so this complaint is partially my own fault . I don't use it in a manner I consider " frequent " and therefore did not think I would miss it that much - I was wrong . Although I don't use it that much , when I want to and don't have it , I have found it very annoying and cumbersome to use the # s across the top of the keyboard rather than that nice little NumLock pad ( as well as the arrows that were there ) . These can be purchased separately but that increases the cost of your keyboard to around $ 50-$60 and it 's already twice the price of good , comfortable keyboards . I had high hopes for this keyboard and the potential was obviously there so , with stars in my eyes , I bought it . It 's around 2 weeks later and I 've already ordered a new keyboard ( basic ergo split keyboard ) and plan to hide this one away in a cabinet , only to be taken out for use as an emergency backup . It 's too bad the great potential of this keyboard is so completely wasted .  
2	  This camera will remove all doubts : the digital age is here ! Sell you film developing stock , because at the rate these cameras are improving , film will shortly go the way of the Victorola and the telegraph . The DC280 is small , fits well in your hand , does EVERYTHING film point-and-shoot cameras do , including a modest zoom capability ( for framing ) , and much more . You can preview your pictures and discard them on the spot , thus saving room for more pictures . You can get a 96MB Compact flash memory card ( think of it as the " film " of a digital camera ) which will hold hundreds of pictures , ( great for vacations when you don't take your computer ) . The flash recharges quickly , the LCD lets you frame the actual picture , the viewfinder works well when you want to conserve your batteries , and the auto focus is flawless . Kodak maintains a web page and I have already upgraded the " firmware " ( the cameras operating system ) . The pictures , even at the large 8 " x 10 " are stunning . If you can't get great pictures with this camera , stick to buying postcards . It comes with everything you need to get going , including alkaline batteries to start you snapping , while the included rechargeables are charging in the included charger . The only things I have since ordered are the DC adapter and a nice case to keep my camera safe . I love it !  
2	  Sure this lens isn't an L , but for a starter or a cheap walk around it 's great . I bought it as a walk around instead of buying a point and shoot . It 's much better then any P & S camera I 've tried , and cheaper then most of the good ones too . For the stuff I really want good IQ on I use my primes . I only gave it 4 stars because I don't use it as much as my other lenses , and it is a little cheap feeling . But it 's very light which helps on long hikes so I can deal with it being somewhat cheap feeling .  
1	  This machine was purchased to replace an analog tape recorder for meetings . It was unusable both in sound quality and software design . It was returned and a Model DS-330 was purchased .  
2	  I was desperate to replace my existing notebook bag , a solidly-made but very heavy briefcase with a strap that cut painfully into my shoulder . Although I knew that a backpack was a better solution than a briefcase , I wasn't terribly impressed with what my local Staples and Best Buy had to offer ; their backpacks seemed overpriced and poorly designed . Then I saw the Mobile Edge SecurePack in a PC WORLD print ad . What a lucky break ! Although my local stores didn't carry it , I was able to get it through Amazon . com marketplace . It 's rare to find a product that fills a need as elegantly and beautifully as the Secure Pack does . The elegance is in the way the Secure Pack prevents access to the laptop it contains WITHOUT locks or cables . The backpack can't be opened until it 's taken off - take it off , then simply reverse the straps over the rear of the pack and unzip it . The " lid " ( actually the back ) of the pack fans open to about 60 degrees , held open that limited amount by a nylon gusset web on either side . This prevents the laptop sleeve , which is directly attached to the inside of the back / lid , from slamming hard against the ground . Inside the pack , in addition to the main compartment , there are the laptop sleeve and a second compartment piggybacked together and fanning out to 60 degrees with the same kind of side-gusset webs as the lid / back . The second compartment has a generously-sized , zippered mesh pocket inside , and loops , sleeves , and a small Velcro-flapped pocket outside - the better to contain pens , pencils , pads , and other stationery , documents , and extras . The main compartment contains for cable storage two nylon-and-mesh zippered bags ( each about the size of a small shaving kit ! ) with Velcro hook strips on their bottoms ; they stick securely to the Velcro loop surface of the main compartment , but are easily detached when needed . In fact , the cable bags are so roomy that I store my webcam and its accessories in one bag , and my laptop power cables , still-camera-battery charger and camera-PC USB connector in the other . With my laptop , a laptop cooling pad , & all those cables stored in the backpack , I STILL have room to shove in a couple of heavy textbooks & zip the pack shut easily ! The SecurePack has two nice extra touches : the CD player pocket ( with zipper closure hidden by a forked flap that is in turn held closed by two quick-release buckles along the straps ) and the carrying handle that is perfectly set within the yoke of the pack straps ( nicely balanced for off-the-shoulders carrying ) . All these features , however , mean nothing if the backpack is too uncomfortable to wear for an extended time . After having worn the SecurePack fully loaded for several hours on several occasions , I can confidently say it is the best-balanced backpack I 've ever worn : not the best-balanced computer backpack , but simply the BEST-BALANCED backpack of ANY type I 've ever used . I don't know how its designers did it , but the fully-loaded SecurePack feels feather-light on my back ; all the weight of the load balances beautifully on my hips and doesn't drag me down . The SecurePack is not a quick-access or compact computer bag , but its name and features make that clear . It is a theft-proof , damage-proof laptop bag at a good price . To sum up , the SecurePack is a beautifully designed product that fills a long-felt need : how to carry a laptop computer and accessories safely , securely , and without back or shoulder injury . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !  
2	  For the money I don't think you will find a better camcorder . I 've had mine for about a week & I 'm very happy with it . I think you could spend alot more for digital and not get asmany useful features . Basically its very easy to use but alsocontains some advanced functions . Picture quality is outstanding . Sony really outdid itself on this one .  
1	  Low quality pictures , lots of red eye and .. the worst problem a digital camera can have .. a LOONG delay when you depress the shoot button .  
2	  I was about to press send on a review lambasting this product as being so different from expectations set by the c|net review , but other reviewers mentioned the " bud sizing " needing to be right . Out of the box , they appear to have the smallest silicon insert . The fit felt fine , so it didn't occur to me to change it . However the sound quality was awful , especially the bass . When I changed to the middle size the sound quality difference was remarkable . The silicon is soft , so the larger sizing is not uncomfortable and the sound is great . I 'm not sure why V-MODA ships with the smallest silicon insert as the default , but they do a huge disservice to themselves for the " out of box " experience . I 'm an average sized adult and with the larger insert , they are a great pair of comfortable earbuds . FYI , others have commented about getting the buds out of the packaging . I found cutting completely around the crimped edging of the clamshell was the easiest way to get them out .  
2	  Works great , plug it in and forget about it . One tip , this is not a router , this is a switch , so you need to first plug your router ( or wireless router ) into your cable modem and then plug this into the router . After that you can plug everything into this and you are good to go . Comes with screws so you can mount it to the wall if desired  
1	  For the price ok i guess . unable to focus at long distance ( football Field ) of verry little use to me . I would not recommend this product  
2	  This uv filter works fine - on my Sony a100 ! The Panasonic DMC 30FZ I bought it for on the accessories part of amazon recommended it and it is not the right size for that . I guess everyone but me knows to double check the small accessories that amazon says go with a unit . Taught me to be more careful , at least , when I 'm buying adapters , batteries , etc , have not had a problem since . By the way , it 's a good quality filter !  
2	  When THE LITTLE FRIEND opens , Harriet Dufresnes , the heroine of this large novel , is only six months old . It is then that her nine year old brother Robin is found murdered in the family yard . After this disturbing introduction , we flash forward twelve years . Robin 's murder has never been solved . Harriet 's family is fractured beyond repair , with a mother almost constantly tranquilized and an older sister who does her best to make herself invisible . Although Harriet may not have known her older brother and may not even realize what a normally functioning family would be like , she recognizes that her family is not it . And so , at the age of twelve , Harriet decides to track down Robin 's killer . Her suspicion falls upon one Danny Ratliff , even though there is no real reason to suspect him other than the fact that he is generally not the nicest person around and comes from a family even more rotten . Of course it is unrealistic to expect Harriet to be successful in her endeavor . She is , after all , a kid on a murder trail long since gone cold and looking for the killer that trained lawmen could not find . Rather , Harriet 's hunt is the plot device by which the author Donna Tarrt explores Southern life circa the 1970s in an extremely well written and wonderfully drawn narrative . THE LITTLE FRIEND can be construed as being what Tom Wolfe refers to as the realistic novel , in which a fictitious tale is used to illuminate an accurate slice of American life . That Americana covers some interesting ground . A grossly fractured and dysfunctional family , race relations between white employers and their black employees , poor white Southern culture , the unique religiosity of the South , all provide fertile ground for Tarrt 's wonderful writing . The best aspect of the book , however , is Tarrt 's portrait of Harriet herself , who is one of the best drawn and most interesting characters in fiction one is likely to come across . Tartt captures a twelve year old 's thoughts and emotions as her view of the world becomes less nave to certain realities with near perfect pitch . And Harriet has just the right amount of precociousness to make her ideal . As one example , Harriet is mischievous enough to forge the hand writing of her goody-two-shoes classmate into a love letter to the Sunday school teacher , but mature enough not to actually send it . Such a proper balancing of characters ' personalities is evident throughout the novel . Some may complain that the ending of THE LITTLE FRIEND is not only unresolved but too empty to be satisfying . I think , though , that such an interpretation misses the point . This is Harriet 's journey through a certain point in her life . Not all of life 's adventures end with a proper and clear resolution and the book 's ending reflects this . Readers had to wait ten years after publication of Donna Tartt 's first novel for this follow up . In my opinion , it was worth the wait .  
1	  Well I got them had them for a week loved them but I was listen to a song with little bass and when I turned the volume up a little got a really harsh sound from both headphones changed the song and found it even worse so I sent them back got another pair same thing in the middle of a song so I wasn't being hard on them at all so they are good while they last but very cheaply made  
2	  After a coworker stole my last connector , I got this one and it works perfectly . Listen to your Ipod through your cpu speakers or other freestanding speakers with a headphone input .  
1	  Same as the others , it worked for 3 days and then stopped working , it would freeze in the middle of a movie , we upgraded to the Audiovox 7 inch and are much happier .  
1	  and I 'm waiting .. and waiting .. and waiting .. and waitingI 'd write a review if I had the damn unit . Right now , its gotta be one star , since I can only imagine ( based on other reviews ) how nice this puppy is . Latest shipment estimate is end of Feburary . 2 1/2 months delivery time ? It could be time to begin to look elsewhere for one of these bad boys .  
2	  Products is exactly as expected . Great for the price and quality is superb . Definitely recommend for people who need cable .  
2	  This is my 2nd FM transmitter for an iPod . The Kensington Digital FM Transmitter is much better signal wise than my previous one . I only have a few gripes with it . The first is that it pops out of my car power outlet very easily . I realize this differs with cars though . There are only three presets when most other FM transmitters have four . However , this is not a huge issue since I only use one preset . My last gripe is more of a personal preference . I like the FM transmitters that are stationary better , not the kind that are a cord . My iPod ends up moving around a lot as a drive and dropping on the floor sometimes .  
1	  iPod was sold as good condition , however it is not usable since the battery is dead .  
2	  I 've been to Burlington VT , Bangor Maine and Natick , MA in the last few days . The traffic updates are awesome , speed limit reminders , reality view .. ect The unit never missed a beat . On track with everything . Absolutely love it .  
2	  I had to replace my old eight port router because of a power incident at my home ( it got fried ) . I bought this to get a few more ports and noticed that I can get a link quicker . It doesn't take up much room on my desk , and I like that too . I 've had it a couple of months now and it has worked flawlessly .  
2	  This product is definately worth the money . Cleaner power reduces visible noise in television screen images , as well as the hiss you hear coming from your speakers when you have them turned up . Also , every thing connected to this surge protector is insured to over $ 350,000 , an amount likely to cover almost any home entertainment system that any of us non-millionaires can afford . With that said I do have to criticisms : Firstly , although the bright blue power light is attractive and makes the HTS850 look expensive , it can be a tad on the bright side , lighting up the space behind your t . v . cabinet when you have the lights dimmed . Secondly , other than the plugs on the top and bottom , all of the plugs are located on the right side of the unit , making plugging in all of your devices a bit of a hassle , epsecially if they have large plugs . Over all it is an excellent product which I would recommend to anyone looking to protect the entertainment investment .  
2	  Got these headphones because I don't like earbuds and most over the ear headphones don't work to well with glasses . These are definitely funny looking and the way they fold are very unique , but they fit really good with my glasses . They dont squeeze the temples and the sound is great . They arent Beats by Dre but they have some bang to them . When I go into class I just fold them up and stick them in my pocket , so they are very convenient .  
2	  I 'm not an audiophile ( meaning versed and experienced with expensive audio equipment $ 10,0000 , $ 20,0000 , $ 40,000 , $ 100,000 and above . But , by the way I hate tin , and I hate tinny sound systems . Hey , this ain't tinny . If it 's not high end , well , I paid only about $ 30-$40 dollars for this and I got it on sale at Office Depot ( this week only ! ? ) . The sound is really good for the price . ( You may not like that expression " for the price ) . " Maybe that 's what 's hanging you up . Maybe you want " good at any price . " But if your expecting the sound of a multi hundred ( or thousand dollar ) audio system for relatively free , then I 'd say , you 're probably also expecting big money to fall down from the sky ; free medical care , a country without a multi trillion dollar deficit ; and other such wonderful imaginary things ( maybe also mermaids , unicorns , ideal fault-free spouses , lovers , and friends , too ! ) . So for those of you who have these type of expectations , well , I guess the system stinks . But from my perspective , so good ! You want big money system free ? Go rob a bank . . . and then there 's prison afterwards . But otherwise , so good ! Enjoy !  
2	  I have own many different brands of earphones , earbuds , etc . The CX300 are the best that I have found in all aspects . They sound good , look good , well made . The wire is silicon as well as the in-ear seals . This is important if you have the skin oil that I do that reacts with other kinds of insulation . After a while I find the wires on my earphones stiff and hard . The screen the use for protecting the driver is durrable too . I got mine at Sears on a closeout and paid more than Amazon quotes , and still one of the best buys ever . I use them for audiobooks , and find if I get into a book that is boring , I can listen to music with all the lows and highs .  
1	  Like many reviewers , my iPod Shuffle was defective out of the box . Naively , I spent hours loading and reloading , reseting , etc as laid out on the Apple website . I finally found a number for customer support and sent it back . I got no apology for the defective hardware . I was told that I should be happy that they were sending me a replacement as if the fact that the brand new one I bought being defective was somehow my fault . The replacement has worked fine so far . I am keeping my fingers crossed . I wish I had immediately sent it back instead of messing with it for hours . It was clearly bad hardwareIf you buy a Shuffle and have any issues with it , send it back right away ! Don't follow their directions thinking that there may be software problems that can fixed . These are made in China with evidently no quality control check . Some are just made wrong and will not work .  
1	  I bought this because I got a computer monitor for free and it did not have a cord . I figured a cheap one would work just fine . Boy was I wrong . The image was wavy and hard on the eyes . I got a different cord and now the monitor works great . This cord does work , just do not expect a great image .  
1	  First of all do not make the mistake to buy it like the rest of us . I owned this device for more than 2 years and it 's one of the worst devices I have ever used . Its the hardest to set up , and the customer service did not help at all . It froze few times and it was hard to turn on , and then the green screen appeared . That was the end . I tried for few days to figure it out but no luck . I had this device for more than 2 years and I had to treat it like a baby ( with the fear of not confuse it ) . Most of the times I had to leave it on ( and the times that I turned it off , before I turned it on I had to prey , throw garlic around and dance around it in order to work . Today the green screen appeared and that was the end . Tomorrow I am going to disassemble it ( so not another person will have the bad experiences I had ) and throw it at the recycle bin . If you are into S & M buy it . It will most of the times ruin your evenings , you will get frustrated and you will suffer . If you are not then do yourself a favor and buy something else .  
2	  Just , Wow I had no idea this wonderful product was out here . I bought mine locally at my camera shop . This is the fastest and safest way to clean a camera lens to date . I bought a used lens in need of some TLC . This product did the job and quickly . I highly suggest this product to anyone .  
2	  This product works just as it is supposed to , nothing snazzy just an awesome gadget !  
2	  The BEFW11S4 v2 and WET11 work perfectly with my XBOX . Easy setup , out of box and playing games in about 20 minutes . The router is on the second floor and the bridge is in the basement . No lag ! No cables strung around the house ! This product fit the bill nicely .  
2	  Good for the second TV in the bedroom to extend your DVR to your bedroom if you don't want to pay for extra receiver and monthly fee . With remote extenders work perfect , just like having the second DVR without paying monthly fee .  
1	  Be careful - I was searching for the ST3750640SCE drive for my Tivo , and this is what I got . It is not the right drive if you are looking to add or replace to your Tivo drive . Dont make the same mistake as I did !  
2	  Hmm .. this product fulfills its advertised function . Holds memory quiet well , without umm , leaking it .  
1	  I bought this a while ago and have used it very sparingly . I have played perhaps 12 discs in it . After the first 8 discs , it started having trouble loading , the picture would freeze , audio would cut in and out , or it would not play at all . I sent it back to Samsung where it was " repaired . " I then watched two movies to see if it was " repaired " and it seemed to be . Then last night I tried to play a Blu-Ray , and all the old problems came back . I saw the first 95 % of a movie and then the end froze , and thirty minutes of stopping and starting and taking the disc out and putting it back in enabled me to watch in pieces the final 8 minutes . Then today I tried to watch another movie , and the player wouldn't load it at all . Software is up to date , everything is plugged in , etc . The thing starts right up and I can move through the menu , but it simply won't play discs . I was somewhat amused in that for the $ 175 I played I got about 12 movies out of it , which is roughly what movies cost in the theater . Maybe it 's a big Hollywood conspiracy to get people going back to the theaters . Spend your money elsewhere . I am saddened as I have a gorgeous Samsung TV that has been wonderful and now I have lost all faith in the brand .  
1	  Kodak is usually a trustworthy name for photo related products . However , this frame does not deliver . As some of the other reviews indicate , I 've had problems with the resolution on pictures when viewed on the frame . Actually , one of my biggest complaints is that the software doesn't have a randomize or shuffle feature for your pictures . I suppose this is my fault for not researching better but I figured it was so basic that every frame would have it , but this frame doesn't , so if you slip a 1 or 2 gig card in the frame you 'll have to go through every single picture in order . Without random , instead of the nice surprise , " Oh , hey , remember that picture ? " it becomes like sitting through a relative 's boring vacation slideshow .  
2	  Bought this ( from Amazon ) and love it . Wonderful picture and great tuner . Picks up six HDTV stations over the air . Setup was completely automatic . I love it .  
1	  Pro : cheap for the functionalities come with it . Easy user GPS display interface . Big screen . Cons : Mine broke after 2 usages / reboot . Basically one of files on SD card gets corrupt and cause the gps to not start up and lock up upon reboot . I can fix this problem by deleting files in the sd card but I would need my computer to do so and the frequency of the happening was too high that I couldn't stand it anymore . It basically happens every 2 reboot or so . Too bad it happened on my 1 week road trip and I wasn't able to use gps at all . I am sure this could be isolated case but I am returning for refund . For record , I didn't order from amazon . Paid $ 100 new . Update : After plugging new SD card and upgrading the OS , everything is working now . I may keep it .  
1	  Like so many multi-function devices , the WCG200 is good in concept , but flawed in execution . Wireless range is awful - the coverage area barely reaches outside my study . I had to spend $ 40 on a high-gain antenna ( which should have been part of the original unit ) and $ 80 on a repeater to get coverage to the bedroom in my modest 1,500 sqare foot house . I wound up spending considerably more money than if I had bought a separate cable modem and wireless router . Linksys has not bothered to support this product with firmware updates , nor are open-source firmware alternatives available . ( See my review of the Linksys WRE54G repeater for issues concerning firmware incompatibility with newer Linksys products . ) My theory is that the WCG200 has performed poorly in the marketplace ( as well as my home ) and development has been ignored by Linksys in favor of their flagship WRT54G line . Another annoyance : When you change the default password from ' admin ' , don't get too fancy . The router will accept a maximum of 8 alphanumeric characters . This behavior is not documented . Using a password containing more than 8 characters , or including any special characters like ' & ' or ' ~ ' will lock down the WCG200 and prevent you from accessing the firmware without a complete manual reset to the default settings . Other Linksys products have had this problem corrected in updates , but not the WCG200 . Unlike the picture displayed with this listing , the actual product has only one antenna . Older versions may have two , but the current WCG200v2 purchased from Amazon has only one RSMA antenna connection .  
2	  Easy to install and synch with PC.I keep loading and loading programs , memory seems never ending . so far so good  
1	  I got these cd-r 's to go with my new cd-r drive that can burn at 52x , but was very disappointed when the various burning programs I used with these discs would only burn these discs at 32x ! I even tried an up-to-date version of Nero Burning Rom and it would only burn at 32x ! I was very disappointed . Other than that , they 're fine though , I 'm just very disappointed ..  
1	  This is an all around bad product , mainly because it will change combinations on you completely unexpectedly . The design is flawed . Mine changed combinations on me spontaneously one day , I probably did it by mistake because of the design of the flip switch which is constantly flipping back and forth . I was about to drill it off when a colleague at work asked if he could try to get it off , he cracked the combination in less than five minutes after looking at a similar Kensington lock . This combination switch happens so frequently that Kensington will pay you the cost of a locksmith to remove it . I don't know why Amazon is still selling it . Do yourself a favour and buy something else .  
1	  Hey I just bought this keyboard and mouse combo . The box , CD and manual says Windows 98 and later . It installed OK , and it went to the web to get the latest version of the software / drivers . Upon restart however nothing worked from the Kensington keyboard or mouse or the inbuilt keyboard and trackpad on my laptop - alarm bells ringing at this point . Nothing when I hooked up my trusty old USB keyboard and mouse despite several hard-restarts . No response on Kensington 's tech support " Please call back etc etc " Their website makes no mention of this item / combo - so I couldn't even download a separate installer for it . I had to F8 & boot up from a previous restore point . As a result it gets no votes - wouldn't work ! Vista users you have been warned . I have used tons of legacy gear through my work which only comes or has available Win98 drivers and they have all worked thus far - this wireless desktop being the exception .  
1	  I wish I had checked here before purchasing . The DVD player failed right out of the box . The same load / read issue as everyone else . It 's going back tomorrow ! I guess I 'm lucky that it failed right away - I 'd hate to be stuck with the darn thing .  
1	  If you are looking for a great set of reasonably-priced cans , special order a set of AKG K240 Monitor headphones . It 's an old , discontinued model , but AKG will still send you a set . I 'm a professional drummer and have been using this particular set of headphones for well over eight years , and they sound great with jazz , classical and even live rock recordings ( Allman Brothers Filmore Concerts , Little Feat Live , etc .. ) . They are durable , astonishingly accurate , and very comfortable for long-term listening . My iPod drives them perfectly up to reasonable listening levels . Anything louder will blow out your ears anyway . The AKG K240 Monitor model is STILL one of the most preferred cans for professional studio production , if not THE preferred cans .  
2	  I received the card on timeI inserted the card in my Samsung mobile . It was formatted correctly and since then the mobile does not recognize it . I have looked at the various technical docs where Kingston claim their SD card is appropriate for Samsung mobile phones and asked their customer support department for advice . Perhaps an issue with the standard between Micro SD Card and TransFlash ?  
1	  Dud . Would not install to by Vista 64 bit ( HP Desktop computer ) . Called their customer service : typical response - must be something wrong with my computer .. yea right .  
2	  The Nikon SU-800 commander is such a great way for me to create lightfrom wherever I want . I do not like flash especially from the camera . This is a very portable way of doing amazing photo 's anywhere , even atnight in the dark and form any angle with a few small flashes on standsor just hand held . Opens up a new world of photo opportunities . Highly recommended . ray kennedy  
1	  On May 22 , 2005 I wrote : UPDATE : After contacting Simpletech they updated Amazon 's descriptions of some of their memory items . If you don't see a compatibility list , please contact Simpletec before buying . I received a RMA and my money will be refunded . On April 10 , 2005 I wrote : Amazon 's description for this item is MISLEADING . It tells about " improvement in your computer 's speed " , " to be as good or better than the memory that came originally with your computer " but this is NOT TRUE . This specific memory module is intended for TEKTRONIX PHASER 7700 printers .

I 'm contacting Simpletech for a return and I 'm also asking that they correct the misleading description  
1	  How can this book be the end all of network security ? After hearing the reviews I picked it up . What a mistake . How can the people who wrote the great reviews claim to know anything about well .. anything . I will admit Mr. / Mrs. Anonymous knew how to use lingo he / she found on the net . If you are a network security type or a rooter do not waste your money on this . I honestly believe that the author purposely wrote the book anonymously just to sell copies . One word .. overflow .. not even mentioned .. anywhere . You can get more out of the man pages .  
2	  Don't be fooled by any " naysay " reviews . This is one easy wireless card to configure with a Linksys WAP11 wireless access point . I just setup my wireless network using a WPC11 PC Card with the WAP11 and the Linksys WDT11 wireless PCI card adapter ( which allows you to use your WPC11 card interchangeably with a desktop PC ) , and everything configured itself pretty much automatically under Window 98 . The setup manuals are very easy to read and understand . If you had any qualms about setting up a home wireless network , trust me : thanks to Linksys , this is not rocket science at all . And now that I 've setup my wireless network .. I am truly amazed at how FAST this wireless technology works . Hooked up to our cable modem , I can't tell the difference in internet access speed between my wireless PC and my PC that 's connected directly to the modem . Bottom line : Linksys is quality and worth the extra money over any cheaper competitive products , such as from D-Link . Neither this product nor the other Linksys wireless network products I mentioned will disappoint .  
1	  I would not recommend any HP camera . This camera was an upgrade from one that broke down a month after the warranty was up , and that one was an upgrade from one that broke 2 months after the warranty was up . I 'm not getting another ! None of the 3 HP cameras I had could be repaired . The only option I was offered was to upgrade . For the upgrade I sent my old camera back and paid slighly less that I would if I bought a new one . They sent me a " new " camera . It was a refurbished camera , not new . None of the damage on any of my 3 cameras was through carelessness or misuse . The first 2 cameras gave me error messages and shut off . I was told this was an internal problem that could not be fixed . On the third camera the screen went blank . It can't be fixed . I 'm going to do a lot of research before buying my next camera , but one thing I 'm sure of - it won't be an HP !  
1	  Title says it all . Here is my message to them dated January 13th : " Question Detail : Today the picture suddenly went black but there was still sound . I changed channels and it was still black . I then turned off the television , waited a few seconds and then turned it back on . A few minutes later it did it again . I repeated the steps noted and it kept happening . I unplugged the unit and then put it back , and again after a very few minutes it went black but the sound remains . I checked all the cables and this continues to happen . I turned off the television and unplugged it for an hour . The picture stayed on for about 45 minutes and the problem returned . What causes this after a little over a year of service , and what are the options available to me ? " This is their response almost three weeks later : " Thank you for contacting Polaroid and for your support and interest in our product . Below is our response to your recent email . We apologize for any inconveniences the delay has caused . Due to high call volume our email correspondences needed to assist on the phones . To better assist you we will need the original date of purchase .

Thank you for contacting customer service as we do appreciate your business . " And they sent it to me again two days ago . Will never buy anything from them again .  
1	  I broke the volume control on my inexpensive 5 watt speakers and was looking to replace them . I purchased the ASC22 's with a rebate so it was an excellent price but they are not nearly as good as the Yahama 's were . No tone control so these sound very bassy ( but not a good bass ) and I can't increase the treble . The yamahas at least had a tone control . I 'm going to look for the yahama YSTM40 's which have 24 watts power , seperate bass and treble controls , comes in black , and doesn't have a subwoofer which I don't need . The Altecs go back . ( .. )  
1	  i used this player at a friend 's place .. and this player sucks big time , The creative MuVo beats the shuffle hands down both in terms of sound Quality and functionality and oh yeah the MuVo has a screen where u can actually see the song name ! The MuVo uses a AA battery and not a apple battery .. I guess people will buy anything apple even if they churn out crappy products like this once in while and try to con people with rubbish like this ! and hey all u apple maniacs remember Newton the crappy PDA from apple ?  
1	  You ever have a computer crash on you ? When it just locks up and freezes and the mouse and keyboard don't respond . Well , that 's kinda what happened to this device . Within about a week of getting it the remote control stopped working , the on / off button wouldn't work and the controls on the machine stopped working . I left it off for a few hours and I turned it back , that helped for a few days but then it stopped working again . I tried keeping it unplugged when not using it , only plugging it in when I wanted to play it , but that didn't help . I plugged it into a different socket , still the same . It finally just stopped working so I returned it to the store where I 'd bought it and the clerk there said that a lot of customers were returning this product ! I ended up purchasing a more expensive DVD / VCR combo . Take my advice ; don't bother with this model . It 's no bargain if it doesn't last !  
1	  color is not vivid , and even not seen in the internet explorer as a hardware .  
1	  The quality of the pictures were great . But then , after 13 months , the camera became dead . Battery is ok . But , for whatever reason , camera is dead . It feels like the camera is programmed to die after the warranty is over so that you will have to buy another camera .  
2	  1 . First , its the best camera for the budget . Look at the price , its fantastic2 . Camera looks - the pictures are deceiving . I bought the camera not for the looks but its functionalities and price . I was a little unsure of how it looks . But when I got it , I was awed . Its perfect . I like this much better than SD750.3 . Shooting modes - its got enough to keep you busy for a while . 4 . Quality - its freaking good . I have taken loads of pics during the night and have not been disappointed . Macro mode is awesome . I got a couple of shots with red eyes , but using Picasa , I was able to clean it out , so no problem . If you need a basic camera for a good price , do not wait . You will get much more than you asked for .  
1	  For one , this product is built very cheap . This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working .. why ? I 'm not really sure .. perhaps cheap components , and slight bending ? Secondly , it does not support charging , and yet it does at the same time . If you plug in say an apple device you 'll get an error , but it will charge which again does not make sense . This is not a 3.0 USB hub , it 's a 2.0 . Many new devices will require you to have 3.0 now or in the near future . For instance , my new webcam hates being plugged into this hub as the performance greatly drops . Lastly : Mine is just about destroyed , because of a slight drink mishap . Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than .. it stops working from time to time , and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again .. just very annoying . - Additional Notes : The Stand is horrible . It won't stay on , especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable . ( It falls out easily , it does not snap on , it 's basically just a slightly heavy stand that it " rests " on top of . ( Useless ) - It glows neon Blue . Why ? I 'm not sure . I like it because it matches my setup , but it 's very bright , and I 'd rather the " power " be used towards the other devices . Finally : This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time .. I would get 3-4 to work .. maybe .. at any given point . Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to " not work " entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with . This also made me think there was something wrong with my device , and wasted my time trouble shooting . ( just had to switch ports ) In other words .. don't buy this device .. get a cheaper hub with more slots , or a 3.0 hub with more features . This is cheap ..  
1	  I 'm a fan of Xantrex products because their quality and performance . But this inverter doesn't deserve to have the Xantrex logo . I just conected it to my battery , turned on and to my surprise and deception it failed inmediately with no load at all , and just left a fried electronic components odor .. Before energizing the system I always check for correct polarity so everything was OK ( no inverted cables , no short cuts , correct grounding ) Later I decided to buy a Xantrex SW2000 pure sine and thats a different happy story , it has worked perfectly so far .  
1	  This router was easy to setup and it was cheap and those are the only two redeeming qualities . The signal is unreliable . When we have multiple devices on it becomes very slow and sometimes doesn't work at all . I have had to reset it several times .  
1	  don't waste ur money get a technic 1200 or a numark ttx or the stanton 150 .  
1	  Not impressed . Charged fine but the adapter to my iPAQ was not secure at all . Any slight motion of the cable and the pda lost connection to my computer . So , unless you plan on not bumping your cable or ipaq EVER while syncing , i 'd steer away from this . Also ran into power issues with the iConcepts cradle .  
2	  I have had a progression of Canon cameras beginning with the SLR Rebel 2000 . When I moved into digital SLR it only made sense to go with a name I could trust-not to mention I could use the lenses I already had ! Over three years ago I purchased the 6.1 mp Canon Rebel . Almost two years later I handed that one down to my amateur photographer daughter and bought the 8.1 mp Canon XT . A month ago I gave the XT to my daughter , who passed the Rebel along to my son-and bought the 10.1 Rebel XTi for myself ! Now there are three very happy members of my family . These cameras are everything the consumer and expert reviews promise-ease of use if I want to go auto , the ability to capture some great pictures by playing with some of the manual features and nothing but praise from everyone for the results . My whole family highly recommends the Canon Rebel for any photographer who loves great pictures .  
1	  The Podwave , at first glance , looks like it would provide useful sound when connected to the iPod ( or other portable audio devices , for that matter ) . The size is good , it weighs very little , and is easy to use . Unfortunately , the sound quality and volume is * very * lacking . I even tried ramping up the level of the signal feeding into the Podwave with a portable " Boosteroo " pre-amp , and that didn't much improve matters ( using an iPod Nano as the signal source ) . I think that with better components ( slightly larger speakers , better amp , and a short extension cable ) the Podwave would be useful . As it stands , it 's more of a " better than nothing " gadget . If you need high quality and portability , take a look at the JBL OnTour ( larger , but much more capable ) which is only $ 70-something if you shop frugally .  
2	  This bag is essential for photographers who carry more than one camera or lens . Adjustable compartments , plenty of pocket space , comfortable arm straps . Perfect . I carry 3 cameras , 2 lenses , film , and have room to spare in this bag . It 's great and having a backpack to go hiking , etc while taking pictures .  
2	  The Creative MuVo TX FM 1GB MP3 Player is a very useful item . It has triple functionality as a storage device , music and radio player .  
1	  This product has a good sound , but poorly built . The I-pod dock failed within the first day . Company would not respond to several calls , service department hung up on me .  
1	  This is the perfect DVD duplication solution if you 're a loner with no children , pets or other responsibilities beyond caring for your DVD duplicator . If you enjoy rebooting , driver conflicts , and troubleshooting inkjet printers , then look no further .. you 'll be in heaven . If you use this printer exactly as suggested , on a standalone machine , with Primera 's own ink ( which will cost you . 35 to . 70 cents per disc you print ) , and you use it regularly , then you 'll be fine . Otherwise , you will spend a lot of time babying it . As a burner it 's quite good , especially at rejecting discs that other burners would pass ( but won't play for the client ) . If you want to burn and print elsewhere , you 'll be very happy . As a printer , it 's expensive and finicky . Every run requires significant testing . Take the time to do single disc print tests until you get everything just right . Then don't change anything . Run your job and all will be well . Printing results are good if you spend the time to test , calibrate , etc . Expect to spend at least an hour on print testing . Once things are set up , it is fire and forget , it 's just the amount of time it takes to get there . The biggest problem is that I haven't found a competing product that does a better job , yet . But I 'll keep looking and update this if I find one .  
1	  I 'd read a number of reviews before choosing the ER6i and so was prepared for some amount of one-time work to get it all right-particularly in terms of fit and learning how to install-but in the end could not get it to produce $ 85 in improvement over stock iPod phones . Most frustrating was that , in changing over to the foam buds , one of the filters-which the instructions clearly state cannot be reused after removal-simply fell out . Of course I reused it because I wasn't prepared to buy a new filter while I was still trialing the thing , which for the benefit of you strong ER6i advocates I 'll admit may have had some impact on my view on performance-although I strongly suspect it was fine to replace the filter and its more true that Etymotic gives that warning because they don't want people to run them thru the diswasher rather than replace them when needed ;-) Bottom line is that my experience-poor fit and inadequate performance-is similar enough to a number of users that regardless of advocates ' reviews it 's clear the product needs some work before it can extend its market appeal . ( Finally , I actually found a noticeable improvement in stock iPod phones when I bought new thicker foam covers ; they stay put in the ear better and am convinced the compression of the thicker foam goes a long way to keep out more external sound . )  
1	  I got it from Amazon being a gift as a package . I put it on a mat with a dark background and it is reflective like a mirror . I didn't even want to use it .  
2	  This is my 2nd Trackman . This one has the additional feature of a scroll wheel . I ditched the mouse years ago . TheTrackman is so much nicer , smoother and operates on the most cluttered of desks . You 'll never go back  
1	  There should be a -5 star option .. I would have chosen it . Connections via wi-fi drops all the time . I have a WGT624 and a WGT634 . Both get stuck on the wi-fi all day . I need to unplug it from the wall to return it to a working condition . I have tried all availables upgrades and made a lot of " Downgrade " to try it out and after reading a lot of reviews and forums I have found out that NETGEAR does not work at all . Please do a favor to you . DO NOT BUY NETGEAR . I am trowing away my WGT 624 , 634 and MP101 and will only buy d-link or linksys in the future . Stupid option I made choosing Netgear .. Nao recomendo nada da Netgear . Eu comprei diversos equipamentos deles e NENHUM funcionou direito . Recomendo que comprem Linksys ou D-link se nao quiserem ter a dor de cabeca que eu tive .  
2	  In searching for a HDTV , I was limited to a 37 " width constraint by my existing entertainment center . After researching the qualities of LCD , DLP , and plasma , I decided plasma was the way to go and this one at 36 " wide was a good fit . The only problem was with the H configuration of the table top stand . In order to flush mount the display with the front of the entertainment center , the front legs of the stand had to be cut back 5 " to keep them from protruding . We are extremely pleased with the quality of the almost 3-D pictures and I am most pleased at how easy it was for my technically challenged wife to master the remote . I highly recommend it .  
2	  In looking for an effective tool to back up my PC incase of a crash this drive fit my needs . So far it has worked great and the software which is the most important element in backing up works well . Also handy to store any large files and pictures . I recommend it after doing a lot of research into which drive could do this job the best .  
1	  This product is average . The internal speakers are a grade C at best . External speaker connection is bare wire . Overall this product is worth the $ 85 price and not any more .  
1	  i bought this monitor and it came to me and worked for 2 days then broke and i ahve to pay to ship it to get it fixed and will have to wait 2-3 weeks .. i wouldnt recommed this monitor to anyone  
1	  I purchased one for my brother who has iTouch , first generation . It worked fine both for the tuner and also to charge . I then purchased one for myself and it will not charge my iTouch second generation . The tuner works fine . The message will not go away from the screen that says this device will not charge .  
1	  No , amount of trying can get the thing to work . All my old files are still not accessible from the many Zip discs I used to use . What a waste of money !  
2	  I 've had this USB drive for about 3 months now , and I absolutely love it . I like to carry around my USB drives on my keychain , and durability has always been an issue . However , this device has a solid , all-metal construction , and an extremely handy and secure retracting mechanism . I get great performance from the drive as well . The U3 software can be helpful for some , although for me , I fail to find it as useful . Fortunately , Sandisk now provides a way to remove the bundled U3 software from the drive itself , turning it into a standard 2gb USB drive . There are cheaper 2gb flash drives out there , but none of them would last nearly as long as the Cruzer Titanium . For the quality that you get , the price simply cannot be beat .  
1	  I thought this would eliminate the 5 remotes littering my family room , but only managed to replace one , leaving me with still 5 remotes . The harmony doesn't work with the Sony PS3 because it lacks blue tooth . You can buy a USB IR receiver to stick out of the front of the PS3 , but you 'd still have to get up and power it on . The harmony doesn't work at all with the Nintendo Wii . It claims to work with the original xbox if you have the IR dongle plugged in , but again , you have to get up and turn the unit on . However , it wouldn't work on my xbox running XBMC ( it may have if I had the time and patience to play with it ) . It would sort of work with my dish network HD DVR . It could power it on and change the channel / volume stuff , but had no buttons to control any DVR functions . The only device the harmony played well with was my Pioneer receiver and Sharp Aquos LCD . I could have used my receiver 's remote to control these things . The remotes LCD display turns on whenever you move the remote , which is somewhat annoying at times . The display also is of low quality and doesn't look like it has the ability to make you own icons , only the generic ones , therefore if you have two game systems , they 'd both be called " Play Game " , which isn't very helpful . Very disappointed in this product considering all it 's hype .  
2	  When choosing a camera I specifically chose the Kodak EasyShare because of the availability of this dock . It makes transfering pictures to my PC so easy .. no fumbling with cords and / or plugs . Just set the camera on the dock , push one button and the pictures transfer . Can't get any more user-friendly than that ! Great product !  
2	  Good price and quick delivery . I have had no problems with this battery . It may not last as long as the Dell OEM but it certainly is close at less than half the price . I 'm satisfied .  
2	  This Drive was easy to install and with the help of the Western digital Web site my computer was up and running in no time . A good value for the price .  
1	  My wife won one of these at a meeting a few months ago - good thing because I would really be po 'd if I 'd had to put out some hard-earned cash to pay for it ! It looks decent enough - although one of the grills had a small ding in it straight out of the box . It has no adapter for 3rd generation Nano 's - but you can call ( a non-toll-free number ) and they will send you a couple of tiny foam squares to help ' secure ' the current generation Nano ( good luck making THAT work ! ) . Most of these quirks I could have lived with - but what I can't tolerate is the truly awful audio quality - absolutely hideous . It won't take an high-end audiophile to recognize it either - even the worst ears out there will know this is REALLY bad . The thin and muddy sound oozing out of the speakers has absolutely no separation , depth , or character - it 's just all " out there " in your face . The equalizer presets are laughable and the bass response is a whimpering after-thought at best . No way , no how would I ever buy this . It is good for me that it was a freebie - but it is bad that I can't return it . Don't waste your money here - unless you want to buy mine and I 'll give you a better deal than Amazon ever dreamed of !  
2	  With Mac OS 10.6 , Apple stopped supporting their own Appletalk protocol for printers . As a result , older perfectly good printers could not be used . This device enables older HP printers that also have a parallel port to be used on an ethernet network , which OS 10.6 can see . It works seamlessly once installed .  
2	  As many have stated this card is great . I don't have a clue about port forwarding or CCTV 's but I got this card in , up & running and can view my cameras from anywhere via the internet or my phone . The cab file it installed is a gem . I received step by step directions once I went to q-see website on how to get everything done and bam ! Also , I do recommend simply downloading all current software from the q-see website to get the current ones . I never even used the disk it came with . I love going and checking in on my home whenever I want . I only have 2 cameras right now but I will most certainly be getting 2 more to fill up the card . I go out of town for my job and this is going to help me sleep much better in my soon to be hotel somewhere in the world :) Happy buying !  
1	  If Amazon had a 0 star rating , thats what I would give this item . Memorex claims that it will work in all CD drives , and that the black plastic doesn't effect the CD . They are lying ! I put one of these into my 2 year old CD drive , it made the " My Computer " screen go corrupt . I tried to burn a file onto it , my drive messed up and the CD no longer worked .  
1	  Still trying to figure out how to power my hard drive with this cable . It covers all inputs . The power cable just sits there looking at me . Put in a drawer till next yard sale . A waste of money !  
2	  this is a very attractive case , and it protects the ipod well . at work , i listen to music almost nonstop . at my desk , i take the ipod off of the belt clip because it is just more comfortable to sit without it attached . when i get up to move around , i quickly and easily clip on the ipod ; i like the efficiency and ease of the mechanism . i often walk a couple of miles to a lunch spot , and i take my ipod in this case on its belt clip . it works great ! this case is definitely helping me enjoy my ipod even more . i 'm including this as a note , but it really doesn't concern me . you can't dock the ipod while it is in this case . like i said , that doesn't matter to me because i neither have a dock nor plan to purchase one . i can connect headphones and charge the ipod without removing the case , and that 's all that i need .  
1	  Do not use an video amplifier if you also have bundled internet service . the amplification interferes with the internet service . i don't know whether it will work satisfactorily if you only have cable service that you wish to amplify .  
2	  I do not know why anyone would not like this mouse . Those previous reviews are way off .. because i use this mouse and it contours to my palm perfectly and it hasn't broken once unlike those old crap mouse we use long ago . It has a nice gray silver color that is pleasing to the eye . It might be a tad expensive but if you want the best , then money is not an issue . Let 's keep our hand happy , give it intellimouse !  
1	  Only used about one month and it was broken . I had to back up data , reinstall OS and exchange the item with WD .  
2	  I have this on a Canon Elan 7e . It 's really great .  
2	  I used For second sound on virtual DJ on MAC .. really works ! Good sound ! MUST TO BUY ! THe quality is AMAZing !  
1	  My Meade telescope came with the 882 standard tripod . The telescope is great , but the tripod is a piece of junk . The plastic locking mechanisms on each of the legs has broken off and I have had to tape the legs to a fully extended position . The unit is less than one year old .  
2	  bought this item for a fishing trip to Canada , product worked just like it advertized , would recommend to anyone . For the price you cannot beat it .  
1	  I am very disappointed because this item I bought came empty . I opened the box and I found nothing but some papers and no filter inside it ! Really angry !  
2	  i 've used this product to keep the battery in the car charged while sitting idol for a period of time . This is just perfect and came in as promised .  
1	  The cord to these headphones split within the first month I purchased them . That caused me to bandage the cord and salvage what i could . By the end of the first year the cord had split in three different places . These headphones are not very durable as once they were dropped lightly the were finally dead ! Not worth your money ! Either buy something cheaper and move to the next pair when finished or just buy something more expensive , with quality worth paying for . I suggest a boss set of headphones for the latter .  
2	  I am brand new to the world of iPods . My wife bought me one . I wanted to be able to hook it up to my home stereo and to charge it without plugging it into the computer . This solved both problems and was affordable .  
1	  This product works well until it doesn't and then frankly you might as well throw it away as the customer support is appalling ! I had my Firebox for two months until it just stopped working . Getting hold of customer support was easy enough unfortunately , it 's only available Monday through Friday 6am - 6pm depending on your time zone . Therefore , bottom line if you are a normal working Joe and leave your house early or get home at a normal time of day , you are frankly screwed ! Just to rub salt into the wound when the problem started I did take off early from the office and called them just after 5pm . After the customary 30 minutes on hold I got through to a tech and we started a few tests . Unfortunately , then we hit 6pm and I was offered the option of paying $ 150 for " out of hours support " or resuming the conversation within their 6am-6pm coverage . Frankly , I was so disgusted that I gave up and bought a $ 40 replacement router . However , a few weeks later I actually had a day off so feeling masochistic I thought I 'd try and fix the firebox , which after all had cost me $ 400 . Anyway , guess what ? Yes , my coverage had expired ! So the moral of the story is that I 'm sure this is perfectly adequate router . However , unless you work part time or enjoy the luxury of having our own technicians who can spend their day on the phone with their support don't waste your cash ! Just buy the $ 40 router and throw it away when it breaks . PS Just by way of contrast I have a two year Panasonic IP camera that just failed . Their support is available 9am to 9pm and it was still covered by the warranty !  
1	  What a waste of a few bucks . I knew I bought an inexpensive filter but please , couldn't you just run a marker around the cut edges of the glass ? The edges looked cheap and reflective . Don't make the same mistake , mine is aging in a drawer .  
1	  I 've noticed a few positive reviews for the MFC5200C , and all I have to say is - we 'll talk in a few months and see if you still feel that way . The machine was good for me for several reasons - multi-function , fair print quality ( if you don't need photos ) , and moderate printing speed . However , after 21 months of low volume usage ( 5 print / copy per day ) , I got the dreaded " Machine Error 41 " . That is essentially the death dirge ( the printer head needs replacing ) . The repair cost is $ 164 , which when compared to the cost of the machine is a " no-brainer " solution - don't ! I 've talked to a couple of technicians in my area , and they said that I am not alone in my Brother problem . If you want my opinion about this particular Brother product , I say buy if you have the expectation to replace it every two years . If you are planning on keeping it longer , then go elsewhere .  
2	  This is a good router and worth the price if you are looking to purchase one . The product is constructed very nicely with many hardware features . The hardware itself includes three detachable 2dbi antennas ( less signal loss ) , vivid connection indicators , and several lan ports . The included hardware features consists with support for wireless standards , security ( wep and mac address filtering ) , and a moderately complex configuration interface . Again , this is worth the purchase .. :)  
1	  This machine was purchased from seller supposing to be NEW ! It was not New but was sold as NEW to me and it worked for one movie then died . This machine was remanufactured but sold as NEW . That should be illegal . MISREPRESENTATION !  
1	  it works better if it is unpluged .. i got a set of rabbit ears from a friend which has vhf on them .. and it works better than this unit .. i am about 50 miles from tv stations  
1	  This camera sucks ! Don't waste your money ! It 's too complex to work and you can only use in heavily lighted areas ! I hate it !  
2	  This card works perfectly , and does everything I could ask of it . Durable , easy to use , and spacious . I used this particularly for an LG Vu for about a year , and then passed it down to my little brother , who is still using it after an additional year . It can be slow transferring large amounts of data , so don't try to use it as a flash drive between computers .  
2	  Needed a good quality HDMI / DVI cable for my plasma TV , but didn't want to pay for the Monster Cable hype . This cable works great and the quality is fantastic .  
2	  I bought the Hot Link Pro so that I could keep my cabinet with all the components closed . It took me awhile to figure out that the eye has to be in a dark place . When I set it up initially the sun would hit the eye in the morning and it wouldn't work correctly . I moved the eye under the cabinet behind a leg , and it now works perfect . I would recommend it .  
1	  My family has already purchased two canon cameras in the past with no problems . I purchased the Canon PowerShot SD1000 two months ago . I was taking pictures at my friends wedding and the camera just stopped working . It wasn't dropped or abused . There were no signs of any abuse on the camera . I sent the camera to Canon to be fixed under the warranty and recived a bill for $ 103.53 . Canon said it wasn't covered under warranty . After speaking with Canon customer service , the price was dropped 20 % . I still have to pay $ 84.76 to fix my new camera . I went on the website to pay for the repairs . The website let me type in my credit card information and then told me it would not take my information . So in the end Canon still has my camara and has a broken website so I can't even pay for the repairs . Things I have learned : -A Canon warranty dose not cover the camara-Canon customer service is only there to listen to the customer complain , they can't fix problems-Canon repair website is broken a lot  
1	  It is a too dark blue filter and as such it cannot be used in a regular photography . It is necessary to have a choice of filters with different rate of density .  
1	  This CD changer has made me want to never by any product by Harman Kardon or it 's parent JBL EVER ! Mine suffered a malfunction after less than a year of use that would cost me more to repair than to simply replace . That is inexcusable in my opinion . I saw a response by a Harman Kardon rep before on this site saying that if the CD player was made after a certain date then the problem wouldn't show up . Mine was made before this date . Question , why was it still on a retailer 's shelf ? Why wasn't a recall done ? That would have saved me a lot of time , trouble , and money . I would have had it serviced under the warrenty but I mail ordered it from the States while I was in Japan . However , I feel it 's ridiculous to have to have such major repairs made to a CD changer after less than 1 year . Denon DCM-370 here I come . It 's a cheaper , 5-disc changer , with HDCD , and can't possibly be any less reliable !  
2	  Needed to replace a cable and this one works just the same as any other RCA cable , except it feels ( tactile wise ) smooth / soft , it doesn't have the usual hard / rough plastic sheathing that most RCA cables do , it bends very nicely so it 's easily hidden or run through tighter areas . As far as quality , it seems just as good as any other wires that I 've used ( and I have rat nests all over my house unfortunately ) . Good price for 12 ' audio cord .  
2	  These are the best headphones I have ever owned . I don't buy $ 250 types but these are great . They are of good quality , portable and sound fantastic !  
2	  Perform just like the literature at Etymotic describes them . Had the ER-6i 's for about four years and the left earphone died . Like the ER-4P 's better . Also , if the 4P 's break , they can be repaired by Etymotic . They do not repair the 6i 's .  
2	  Universal Serial Bus ( USB ) - and close on its heals , 1394 Firewire-has become the indispensable Personal Computer ( PC ) port connection for adding and or operating Plug-n-Play peripherals to your PC . Most computers now typically ship with at least two USB ports in the back and two in the front ; with some business class PC 's have four in the back and four in the front . I build my own computers for myself and my immediate family ; in fact I just build a new PC for my nieces and nephew . All of the newer motherboards and cases I have purchased of late have had at least two front USB connections , but alas my personal workstation which I build some three years ago lacks such accoutrements . But increasingly , I find myself utilizing more and more USB connected devices ; e.g. web cams , memory sticks , printers , external hard drive etc . , and continually having to dig behind my PC for an available USB connection is a inconvenientI currently have an internal PCI USB 2.0 card installed so , for months I have been searching for an internal USB version 2.0 hub for under $ 50.00 that would fit into a standard 3.5 ' or 5.25 " drive bay . Enter the " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub , " which combines four USB 2.0 with two 1394 Firewire connections . The " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " is an easy-to-access device which can be installed in any available 3.5 or 5.25 " ( by using the included 5.25 " mounting rack ) device bay . However , one available 1394 port and / or an internal USB 2.0 port must be available in the computer to connect the " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " via connections on the back of the unit . I assumed that the Firewire connections were standalone ; my assumptions were incorrect . The " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " works with various types of USB 2.0/1.1 and 1394 devices including digital camcorder / cameras , external CD-RW / DVD-ROMs , MO drives , external hard drives , flash USB drives , memory sticks , USB memory modules , PC video cameras , memory card readers / writers etc . Installation : In order to install the " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " you have a Pentium or equivalent computer with one available 3.5 " or 5.25 " device bay , and have Windows 98SE or later installed on your computer . The " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " was simple to install ; the process took less then 10 minutes from start to finish , and no software is necessary , though the USB 2.0 card already installed in the computer must support a USB hub . In the box SIIG includes everything needed to get the hub up and running , including the following :* 3.5 " USB 2.0 + 1394 6-Port Bay Hub * 5.25 " mounting rack * Power Supply " Y " cable * Accessories set * USB cable * 1394 6- / 6-pin cable * User 's manualSince I do not have an existing 1394 card installed in my computer , I cannot address connections functionality . I installed the " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " in an available 5.25 " drive bay , making sure to attach the ( included ) USB cable and power connections before securing the unit with mounting screws . Once in place I powered on the PC , and logged into Windows XP , which detected and installed the hub . I then inserted a LEXAR 128MB JumpDrive into the first slot ; no surprise , it works . First Impressions : " SIIG USB 2.0 / 1394 Combo Bay Hub " works , and works well . Transferring data is swift and painless , and my only regret is that I could not test the speed of the 1394 port . The unit includes two lights beside each port , the upper indicating error , and bottom illuminate when a device is inserted . I found this out through trial and error , since the owners manual contains no information about the displays .  
2	  I waited for a while to get the 250 GB , until the prices came down . This iomega is super easy to use - just plug it in and go , no software to download . I carry it between my work ( where I use a Mac OS X ) and home ( PC Windows XP ) and it goes between the two computers with no problem . Very good item for the price , and actually a small investment for protecting ( backing up ) all your music , photos , etc . UPDATE : This device crashed on me after six months of use . Terrible ! Google " Cypress at2lp rc42 " and you will find tons of people who have experienced the chipset driver defect with this product . Iomega should issue a recall .  
2	  what a deal with this thumb stick ! works perfectly fine , just plug and play . cant beat the price !  
1	  * Update on 4/24/07 * It 's now April , and this product still doesn't work after 4 months of email exchanges with Netgear technical support . It is taking themn 2 weeks to reply to an email ! I give them the information that they ask for , and they reply with gibberish and / or procedures that just doesn't work . It 's amazing ! I 'm keeping it going just for the entertainment value . * Original post from February .. I 've been disappointed with this router because of Netgear 's inconsistent technical support and poor instruction manual . I 'm pretty technically savvy about computers and electronics , and I 've never experienced this much trouble with a device . Buyer beware ! I 've been using the router with a Dell desk-top PC running Windows XP Home edition connected to Bellsouth DSL . ( I don't think this is too unusual a configuration . ) I wanted to be able to use my work laptop at home throughout the house without another hard-wired internet connection . When the Netgear router has worked , it has worked very well . But , getting it to work has been quite a chore . Following is my saga . Draw your own conclusions .. Problems began right out of the box . It promises quick and easy installation .. just insert a set-up CD with Netgear 's Smart Wizard , then follow the instructions , and in just a few minutes you should be up and running . This was not the case . At first , the wiz seemed to be progressing just fine , but then at a critical step , it just hung . I started over , taking extra care to ensure that I followed every instruction , but the same result . There was no documentation in the box to fall back on , so I had to call technical support . It took time to navigate through their technical support process .. you have to punch in a bunch of numbers and register the product . But , eventually , I got to a live human being , albeit someone obviously not American . This in and of itself is OK , but the accent made it very hard to understand them . Moreover , this person was not very helpful . After about 20 minutes , the router was still not working and no solution seemed likely anytime soon . I was frustrated . I ended up calling back later , and the second person was easier to understand and even better was exceptionally helpful . After about 20 more minutes , we got the router working . All was well for about 2 weeks . The router worked flawlessly . Other family members could use the desktop PC while I used my laptop . We could surf from both computers at the same time without any noticeable loss of speed . Just one minor nuisance in the form of a log in screen that popped up every time I turned on my desk-top computer . But , it really worked great . But , alas , one day the router just quit working for no apparent reason .. maybe a power outage .. I don't really know . I had to go back to technical support because the process for getting the router set-up is just not intuitive or logical . Without a working set-up CD or good documentation , you 're just on your own . And , I couldn't remember enough of how we did it the first time around to get it working again . So , as I say , back to technical support . This time around I made notes and printed out two key MS Explorer screens that were part of the set-up process . All was well for several months . Then , the router quit again about 3 weeks ago . So , I pulled out my notes and upon close inspection found that one of the Netgear screens that I printed out truncates the right side of the Explorer screen , and this included the last digits of the IP address which I had to know in order to get the unit working again . I was stuck . I tried downloading the manual for the unit from their web site . It 's the most unhelpful users manual that I 've ever read . The basic set-up part essentially says " Follow the Smart Wizard " which doesn't work . The advanced set-up part assumes one can get to the router 's set-up screen which I 'm unable to get to for some reason . Therefore , I had to go back to tech support . But , bummer ! I 'm now outside the free 90 days phone tech support window . So , I had to choose between paying $ 37 per 30 minutes of phone support or getting support via Netgear 's web site . I opted for the later . It 's been three weeks of back and forth across their site , and the router still doesn't work . They 've given me procedures to follow that simply don't work . Note that when I answer their questions or report what has happened when I try to follow their instructions , it typically takes 2 days to get a reply back . And now , two nights ago , someone new took over my " case " and informed me that the problem is that I 've never registered the device . Naturally , this is baloney . I had to register the router months ago to get tech support in the first place ! And , of course it 's really beside the point anyway . So , I 'm frustrated again and considering throwing the router in my electronics recycle bin and buying a new one . A user needs a step-by-step procedure for setting up a device like this . After all this time and effort , Netgear has been unable to provide this to me . Good luck !  
2	  Years ago , I had a Zapper . It had an attachment where I could also " Zap " numbers , or stop other unwanted numbers . I thought this one Zapper would do the same . However , there is no attachment . From what I understand , the Zapper will prevent unwanted numbers for the most part , and I can lift the phone receiver for two or three seconds , to prevent other numbers . I tried that and the numbers keep coming through . There must be something that I am not doing right . Otherwise , I believe the Zapper does what it is suppose to do .  
2	  Yes , it 's expensive . Yes , it 's for a machine that is long outdated and probably no longer supported by the factory . Supplies for this machine is starting to get a little hard to find , so finding normal consumables like the toner is a great ( considering that the machine will still make great copies and that we got the machine for free ) . Only thing is that cost on consumables on this machine is high ( toner , imaging cartage , etc ) , so we will probably retire this machine when this toner runs out .  
1	  This boom pole / fish pole is USELESS unless ( I assume ) you buy the mic holder / shock mount of the same brand . Basically , it doesn't work with ANY other mic holder / shock mount . The part where the mic holder / shock mount goes is inverted ! It 's a hole instead of a screw . Your mic holder will not screw ONTO it ! You must buy a mic holder that screws INTO it . USELESS with any other brand of mic holder / shock mount .  
1	  The iPod suddenly went dead after five months of very casual use . Since the warranty on this is 90 days , I enquired about an out-of-warranty service . The repair would cost $ 270 ( not including shipping and taxes ) . You can buy a new one for around $ 300 . Apple was very unsympathetic . When I first got the iPod , I thought it was a great product . I 've changed my opinion entirely . The fact that the iPod only comes with a 90 day warranty is risky especially since the repair is so expensive . My advice is to only buy the iPod if you can get an extended warranty . If , like me , you believe items like this should have a standard one year warranty , buy something else or you run the chance of being stuck with a $ 400 paperweight .  
1	  Today I received the Canon EF-S 17-85mm and I was very excited . II have been shooting with the kit lense my Rebel XT came with and had been getting okay results . I wanted to upgrade to a better lense to met my growing expectations for picture quality and diversity . Well , after a day of shooting in different situations , I am returning this lense . I was amazed that the picture quality was very similar to my 18-55mm kit lense . I am no professional , but I and a friend of mine could not see one bit of difference between the $ 130 kit lense and the $ 600 17-85mm . It was a tough toss-up between this lense and the 24-105mm F / 4 L. After seeing the pictures produced by the 17-85mm , I am going with the L-series lense hoping it will be much better . The IS is a great feature but cannot compensate for the F-stop . Even though the 17-85mm is F / 4-5.6 . You will do almost all your shooting in 5.6 . It 's like it is stuck in 5.6 . Even with manual adjustment , the widest I could get it was 5.0 . I hope this review helps others in making the right choice . If you have the money go with the L-series . The extra focal length is just not worth $ 600 for the same quality  
2	  Perfect for the price . I do a lot of retouching , drawing , hand drawn animation and this pen is the perfect replacement if you have your original grip pen missing or broken . My old Intuos 2 is still rocking !  
1	  Routing - very poor . It told me to get off a major toll road in the middle of my jouney . What because there was some dirt track which was shorter ? Another thing it did was tell me to turn right , make a u-turn and turn right again instead of just continuing on the same road . That 's just mad ! No way points - It would make sense to plan a long journey in advance on a PC and put in a few way points . No chance with this Navman . Unstable software . - requires frequent rebooting . Destinations - Ahh this makes me mad . I even struggled to find Miami International airport . If you don't know the zip code finding a street is very difficult and frustrating .  
2	  The toner arrived in just a couple of days and it works perfectly in my old LJ 5 printer . Excellent product for the price ! I had purchased 2 just in case 1 had problems ( buying 2 was still less than 1/2 the price of new HP toner ) , but I 've already printed hundreds of pages with zero problems . Good stuff !  
2	  It allows my dvd 's of family I brought from England to the states on DVD to play on a USA TV . It has progressive scan and auto detects if TV is PAL or NTSC so no tech tweaks needed . V Good picture and plays DIVX \ XVID format clips and films no problem out of the box and could you not want for more for price .  
2	  I bought this bag for my Camera body and 4 lenses . Fits everything great ; not a too tight fit . Looked at other bags and settled with this one and am very happy I did . Good quality , comfortable , easy access , and enough room for my stuff . You won't be disappointed .  
2	  Connected upscaling DVD player to 40 " Samsung LCD . Works well .. picture looks good  
2	  Everyone has probably made sufficient good comments .. I think mostly people want to hear the cons .. ( 1 ) Earphones that come with it .. kind of big .. at least for my ears . Some serious ear hole stretching going down ( 2 ) Depending on how your USB port is positioned .. my junky laptop didn't allow the unit to be fully plugged in . So I had to spend another 8 bucks ( which actually could have easily been closer to $ 24 if I hadn't comparison shopped ) to buy a USB extension . ( 3 ) The armband is a little bit iffy in terms of fit and comfort . ( 4 ) If you like to fast forward through songs and toggle around , the multiple functions in one toggle button can be a huge pain . I still sort of wish there was some way to have the option of both recharging the player and an attachable battery pack ( which is available with the Philips keyring ) . But given the fact that the Muvo is about 70 bucks cheaper , I sadly chose to help murder a little more of the environment . Otherwise I 'm satisfied so far , but then I only started with it today .  
1	  thought this would be a great solution for tunes in my car . Called apple and their rep highly recommended it for Los Angeles . It performs horribly all over southern california . I spent months and used it on all frquencies . It was frustrating and I am deeply disappointed in apple for the recommendation .  
1	  I have a unibody MacBook pro , 15 " , and this protector didn't come anywhere close to fitting it . It was way too small . I don't know if they sent me the wrong one or what , but I 'm not going to spend time waiting to see if the next one fits-I 'll just get a refund .  
2	  I needed a speaker set up in my workshop for testing audio circuits that i like to build and was looking at studio monitors , then i found a website with audio test frequencies , i played the various tones through these speakers which i had already hooked up to my computer having bought them a year ago , then i realised if these sound good why not use them , so i went out and bought a second pair just to use in the workshop , now when i 'm not using them for testing , i can plug them into my smartphone , mp3 player etc and listen to music . I was concerned about the frequency response , but the test tones sound great , the 40Hz one is REALLY sweet , fantastic low down bass response . A great sounding set up which you can use for computers , ipods , mp3 players etc , you would be hard to beat these unless you spend substantially more cash !  
1	  I ordered this cable from Sewell Direct . I received the cable in generic form . It was not packaged by Belkin . It did not say Belkin on the cable itself . It came in a plain plastic bag . My cable at home has Belkin imprinted on it , enclosed in Belkin packaging . I returned it to Sewell . They promptly refunded my full purchase total plus the return shipping costs . They should specify this generic or bulk packaging , so that I do not waste my time ordering from them .  
1	  I have a amd athlon xp 2100 + , 8x agp capable motherboard , 300 watt power supply , a battery bacup , 512mb ddr 300 ram and Windows XP Pro . Before getting this card , I had a NVidia GeForce 3 , which although not the fastest card , it was at least STABLE , not a single crash . With the ATI 9700 , I have had nothing but problems , especially with UT2K3 and Morrowind . There are two types of crashes that occur frequently : 1 - the game just crashes and exits back to the Desktop . OR2 - the system reboots in the middle of a game . I have the latest drivers , but I suspect in this case that the card is overheating . I will acknowledge however , that the card is by far the fastest I ever seen , but I would never sacrifice stability for performance .  
2	  I 've had mine for nearly 4 years . I use them while operating a loud tractor / mower , while on the treadmill , and when traveling . They block the sound well , the earpieces are comfortable , I have no idea what the attenuation , and all that BS is ; however , the music sounds great , the recorded books I listen to are great , and everything is perfect , except the wires get tangled when I stuff them in their case . I highly recommend this product .  
2	  Not sure if Philips corrected the problems mentioned by others ( the dim lcd and the absence of cue and review ) , but my EXP103 arrived yesterday , and let me assure you : lcd is FINE , and cue and review can both be accomplished by pressing and holding down the & gt ; & gt ; or << button for long enough to invoke this feature ( it 's possible that these folks just didn't bother to read the instructions carefully ) . Let me also assure you : THIS PACKAGE ROCKS ! I 've tried it stand-alone with both mp3 and music cd 's . Plenty of volume and good sound . The earphones included aren't my type ( I don't like the kind you stick in your ears ) , but so what , you can get a good headset reasonably priced right here at amazon . I 've tried both mp3 and music cd 's with the car kit - very good sound and plenty of volume , and I have a generic cassette player . The anti-skip feature works great . I haven't even tried some of the other features , but I 've tried all the essentials I want , and I 've come to this conclusion : THIS DEVICE IS KILLER ! Philips included basically EVERYTHING you need . Even though I know prices will be dropping , I can already tell on day one of use that it was worth the price . Go for it !  
1	  The device i bought is not working at all . The power is on and the buttons work fine , but it doesn't communicate with each other . I 'm returning it .  
1	  I 'm now sending back my second router for a third , shipping at my expense and going without a router for several days each time . I 've spent hours and hours on the phone with D-Link support , which is really good . Too bad the hardware is pure junk ! Also had many issues getting the wireless to work with my macbook and Ipad . Buy anything else but this router !  
1	  Never received my iPod nor did I receive a response from the sender in regards to where my iPod was . The only way to get the tracking number was through the sender b / c Amazon did not have it which makes no sense since I purchased it through Amazon . I just was not pleased with the entire situation .  
2	  New puppy chewed up remote . System can't be used w / out a remote . Item listed at a great price . Perfect replacement . Superfast shipping .  
1	  The most annoying thing is the volume - it comes on at the same volume , regardless of the volume you were listening at the last time you used it . You then need to adjust it each time . And even more annoying , the volume up and down are two separate , and hard to find buttons , which make it louder or quieter in preset increments . It gives you very little control , and even the lowest volume is quite loud , so I can't get it as quiet as I want it . Really poorly designed . Don't buy it .  
2	  great little ipod .. holds about 240 songs which is plenty for what it is used for . Difficulty figuring the loading at first , but that is because we were trying to make it harder than it was . I would buy this again in an instant .  
2	  A very good audio system , but sounds exactly the same as the previous IM2 which you can have for half the price . I have been all my life in HI-FI , and honestly believe I can easily distinguish the characteristic sound of any of these kind of systems . Nevertheless , to me , IM2 and IM4 really sound exactly the same . So , before buying an IM4 , give a try to IM2s or ( if you believe me ) just look for IM2s'offers at Amzon or elsewhere ( they are still very popular systems ) . As said above , you will find IM2s for HALF the price of IM4s .  
1	  This is a very nice camera in terms of the photos it takes , but I have had technical problems . The problem is that the camera displays a message " please remove lens cap " even though the lens cap has been removed . This is an intermittent problem which sometimes prevents me from taking pictures . Annoying . I have no idea how common this problem is and am prepared to give Nikon the benefit of the doubt that this is unusual and should not be taken as indicative of the quality of their digital cameras as a whole , however I do have a problem with the quality of service offered , which is certainly more broadly applicable . The product is under warranty so I sent this back to be repaired . Nikon would not cover the cost of shipping , although I asked them to do so . The camera was serviced and returned ( 2 weeks later ) , however the problem persisted . I requested that Nikon send me a new unit since they had failed to fix the problem and I did not have time to send it to them for another two weeks before I visited family for Christmas . Their service policy prevented them from doing this , but since it was a return service they would pay for shipping this time around . No good to me . The implication is that they take ownership of the problem if they fail to fix it with the first visit , however I would suggest that they ought to take full ownership of the faulty product from the start . They tell me that their policy is that they will consider replacing the product if I have to send it in for repair for the same problem a THIRD time . ( I think I will be shopping for Canon camera by that stage ) They are one step behind where a company of their standing should be . Sloppy .  
2	  I knew little about camcorders when I bought this . It got mixed reviews , but I 've been extremely happy with it . It 's simple to use and the video quality is very good . The 20x zoom is a nice feature , as well as the ability to store video on the MiniDV or a SmartCard . I would recommend it to anyone .  
2	  The item was exactly as described ! Fast shipping , very easy transaction from start to finish ! I accidentally threw away my power cord to my TV , so this was a lifesaver !  
2	  I bought this product when my old ball mouse went kaput on me . So far , I 'm happy with the optical mouse . It glides effortlessly across the mousepad , unlike my old mouse . What I like best about the optical versus the ball is its maintenance . I don't have to worry about dust and particles finding their way inside the mouse . Therefore , I don't have to take it apart to clean it , as I had to do with the old mouse . The scroll wheel was cumbersome at first ; however , if you click gently on it while the cursor is pointed in the scrolling area , it works just fine . This mouse comes with software , although it works fine without . It also has an adaptor , which allows you to hook it up to a USB or PS / 2 port . I haven't tried it on my Performa yet , but if it works I think I 'll go out and buy another one .  
2	  I was pleased with the performance of this printer . The WiFi setup was relatively painless , just connect the Ethernet cable to setup , then unhook it once the Printer has been configured to use the WiFi . There is a simpler " one touch " WiFi install , but my Linksys wireless router that Comcast provided 6 months ago does not support this . I will have to admit that printing over the WiFi connection adds a considerable lag to the printer speed for the initial page . And if you turn off your printer frequently while not in use , you will get an annoying pop-up on your PC that indicates the communication is broken . All in all the print quality and performance are good and it was a fair price on Amazon .  
1	  Nothing but trouble since i bought it . Pricey to maintain . Noisy . Firmware is a joke . I 'm still looking for a reliable replacement , but this has to go .  
1	  My office has had two of these that leaked ink internally when new . I would stay FAR away from this printer .  
1	  SiPix has a problem - their cameras only work with older computers ! If you have a newer model with a usb 2 port it won't work - and there seems to be no fix available . Judging by the information on their web site , even the newly released models ( e.g. , the " snap ) only work on the older standard - so if you have a new computer , or an older one with usb2 - save yourself the headache and buy from a different manufacturer .  
2	  Good product . I bought it to connect my Celestron ( 15x70 ) binoculars to my Vista Explorer tripod . Everything worked nicely to my relief ( since the 3 items are of different brands ) . The adaptor works properly . My main objective was to reduce the vibrations resulting from holding the heavy binoculars in hands while looking at the sky . The adaptor is doing the job nicely so far without any issues .  
2	  Works like a charm . The handle is really strong and I like the way it ratchets up . They really thought of everything a user would think of .  
2	  We purchased this wireless headset for my mother and it works great . My family has hearing problems so this review is not going to be as much about frequency response / sound , even though we feels these do sound great . My dad can't hear distinct sounds from the new TV 's speakers when the volume is up where my mother listens to it . However , when my dad put the headset on , he was amazed at how he could hear every distinct sound with crispness ! My mother can now listen to the TV without having it blaring .. the headset has it 's own volume control . Now my dad can read in quiet and mom can still watch TV . We may get another headset for dad so when he wants to watch TV he can hear it . The base stays plugged in and it turns off automatically . If the TV is off it shuts itself off after a few moments ( green LED on base transmitter ) . Also , my parents have a typical flat ranch style house and these work clearly and flawlessly anywhere , even outside or in the garage ! There are only a couple of issues , which are very minor . Unfortunately the tune dial is next to the volume dial , so to fix any mix-ups we put some clear tape over the tune dial once it was tuned in good . This will prevent unintentional tuning when changing the volume control . Another thing is the headset is not rechargeable . It just takes a pair of AA batts , so be sure to turn it off when finished . This hasn't really been a problem . We are still on the first set of batts . These are great . I think they sound good and the work well . Great buy for the money !  
1	  This is the first time I have tried an non-HP cartridge . For some reason , full page of graphics print fine . Text from any word processor only prints half a page - the left side of the page only . It then fades out to nothing on the right .  
2	  The reason I bought this amp was the High Current and The Beauty of it . But then I had it installed , oh my god ! This thing is so powerful with it 's 4 40 amp fuses , 2 cooling fans and did I say High Current .. I have this amp hooked up to 1 1000 watt Eclipse 12inch Subwoofer inside of my Ford Expedition , and did I say High Current , to be blunt this amp has never cut off once from over heating , and i 've had some nice amps in my day .. So if you have a need for the last amp you 'll ever buy , get the A2300HCT BY AUDIOBAHN - DARRYL OF BALTIMORE  
2	  I use this camera for professional usage . Since we have a small budget we decided with a cameras priced only under $ including accessories . The powershot S110 is overall a good camera for personal use . The quality of the images are good , the zoom lense and the compact size are great . We did encounter several problems . The battery life is rather short , and the camera does NOT come with a power adapter so that you can use the camera while it is charging . This was a severe inconvenience , because we had to spend an additional $ on a power adapter . The photos also tend to have a yellow tint , which can easily be fixed with an editing software , but if you aren't too fimilar with photoshop or programs like it , you will have a yellow tint to many of your pictures . The images load quickly onto the computer . Memory life is good , if you set your image resolution to the lowest size you can store up to 80 or so photos . Though if you plan to take this traveling with you then invest in a memory card and a spare battery . The camera is reasonably priced in my opinion , but the accessories are very expensive , so price that in when you consider this camera .  
2	  When I was deciding on which 19 inch monitor to pick I did not base my opinion only on the reviews and experiences of other people . I decided to look at all the monitors that I thought were excellent or very good monitors ( Samsung , Viewsonic , NEC , Philips , Sony ) . I went to my nearest retailer 's and checked out their current displays . I was welcomed by the Viewsonic 19 inch monitors and was astonished by the Sony 19 inch monitor . The Samsung 19 inch monitors were not as impressive as I heard they were . I could not find any Philips displays . But I did notice one monitor that had both sharp text and rich clear graphics ( Mitsubishi DP930 ) . Its image was as smooth looking as the Viewsonic monitors with a hint of sharpness and slightly richer in color . What amazed me was that no other monitor compared to it except the Sony 19 inch monitor ( which was very $ ) . I later found out that the Mitsubishi DP930 and the NEC FP912SB were the same monitors . Playing games and watching movies were excellent , but I did not get to do any image editing as yet . I highly recommend this monitor for its sharp text and very good graphics and image quality . I recommend you use the Naviset software to adjust the monitors settings .  
1	  I 've had this reader for a few years , and it was working well , but mostly used it with SD cards . Recently I inserted a CF card , and after investigation , realized that one of the CF pins were bent . After doing some google research , it seems that CF pins bending can happen in readers in cameras ( ie . canon 5d ! ) , etc .. so while the pin bending may be a defect / weak point of the CF design , I was disappointed to find that I could no longer read SD cards ( seems like when the pin shorted , it took out the entire reader ) . I give 2 stars because it worked for so long . I 've since ordered an individual SD + reader , and CF reader , to avoid having to replace the entire unit in the future ( at the sacrifice of a convenient all-in-one tool ) .  
2	  I am a Dish Network subscriber but cannot receive my local HD channels because where my dish is set up the satellite I need for those channels is blocked by my apartment building , the building owners won't let me move the dish to be able to receive them so I have to resort to using an antenna to watch them . I am using this antenna indoors , have it hanging on the wall next to my entertainment center , and it does an awesome job pulling in all my local HD channels . I live about 14 miles from the towers ( 4 towers are SE of me and 3 towers are NW of me ) and I am getting good signals from all of them ( avg . signal strength is in the mid 70 's ) . I live in a " garden level " apartment .. meaning my apartment is 1/2 underground and 1/2 above ground and even with that and being surrounded by other apartments and trees this antenna works GR8 ! I chose this particular antenna based on the many positive reviews of it . It was easy to set-up .. took 5 minutes .. took another hour of fiddling around to find the right spot on the wall for best reception . It was definately worth the money .  
2	  Excellent USB drive . I like that you can just plug it in and it boots up super fast . Unlike the previous product I had , the SanDisc Cruzer , which installs it 's user interface on your computer that you must use , it 's very annoying and slow - it also failed on me in less than a year . This Kingston is great , so much capacity and a great value , I bought two . Going to buy more !  
1	  I bought a pair of these headphones based on a review I read in a magazine . It said something about being the most bang for the buck . Although I prefer the earpiece wires to be symmetrical in length , the different lengths were not a big deal for me . They look great , and the fit of the headphones themselves is very good ( comfortable and will not easily fall out ) . The issue I have with these is the sound quality . For headphones which sit directly in the ear canal , they sound a little too muffled for my taste . I was expecting a much cleaner / crisper sound from them . Although they are not terrible , I find them to be lacking in the fidelity department . Would I buy them again ? The answer is no , which is why I only gave the item 2 stars .  
1	  4 years later it breaks and the part needed to repair it will be over $ [ .. ] ! I called sharp and they say it 's 4 years old and I say " It 's ONLY 4 years old " . I had to ditch it .. huge loss . I am really upset at Sharp .  
2	  Purchased these few months ago and they work great . Sound is pretty darn good , I also use them on my lap top while playing games or music videos . Great price and great product  
2	  I expect Tiffen to produce good photographic material and they continue to live up to my expectations with this polarizer .  
2	  I bought this for my husband and gave it to him before Christmas . My husband really loves this . One issue is , it needs a better antena . I had an extra wire antena that I put on the radio for better reception . The sound is amazing and for such a little radio it has a high output of volume . ( my husband is hard of hearing , so this was important ) . I would recommend this to anyone who wants to listen to world wide broadcast without having to spend a lot of money for a bigger radio .  
2	  looks very professional . ive gotten alot of good comments .. however , the trim ( edges ) is not leather , it 's just some brown plastic sewn into the edges . , but the leather is really tight , and it does not fit more than a computer and a book ..  
2	  After messing around with two video cards from another Mfg ( that I could not get to work , my Quick play arrived today and it is a Great little product . It 's quality is better than expected and in combination with Avermedia 's PCI 350 TV tuner , I have my own PVR at a fraction of PVR / TiVo prices . One word of caution , make sure your Display settings do not exceed the max . I made this mistake and took me a while to figure out why it was not working-Pilot error .  
2	  Purchased for my son for Christmas , this was a product that he had requested and is very happy with it .  
1	  After owining many portable dvd players i feel this is not a very good one . It lacks some key features that other ones like it have , such as games ect .. A better model would be the d1812pkg just a bit newer , and a lot nicer  
2	  This hooked one device to another , just as it is supposed to . It cost 20 dollars less than the same thing from a brick and mortar store . What else do you need to know ?  
1	  We purchased this item in Sept . of 2010 . This microwave didn't last more than 15 months ! I would not recommend it .  
1	  Very disappointed in this product . The product I ordered said it was USB adaptable . The one I recieved was capatable with windows 97 ! This product is over 14 years old ! So to say the least , it was not compatable with my windows XP laptop . So now I have a mouse that my daughter can't use . She was very upset ( she 's 3 ) and doesn't understand why it won't work .  
2	  I 've had my Volt for about a month now , and I absolutely love it . Sound quality is great , the LCD display is large and clear , it 's not a battery drainer .. this thing is wonderful . Don't understand the people who claim to have had problems figuring out the PROG button , or the different modes .. programming a large ( 250 + song ) cd is a piece of cake . Buy this player , you won't regret it .  
1	  Oh how this thing sucks let me count the ways . # 1 On alot of my DVD 's the audio would get out of sync from the video . This would happen with store bought DVD 's very very annoying . # 2 . Half the time it would take a minute or more to read a DVD . # 3 . Most of the time a DVD would freeze during play . # 4 and the worst part about this thing is after a few months of light use it wont load a DVD anymore , when I looked up the problem online its most likely that the laser assembly is broken , so prety much money down the drain . Avoid buying this thing . I have learned the hard way that its cheap price tag comes from cheap parts that break in a few months .  
2	  This device charges as well as transmit the FM signals to the radio . It works quite well . The only downside to the product is that the display is somewhat hard to read . There is not a dimmer button to control the background lighting which makes it very hard to see the numbers .  
2	  Ordered in July 28 and it was shipped in next day , so I can take it in my new vacation . As to the mp3 , it is the oldest style of iRiver Triangle Series . The decent shape and excellent voice quality impress me so much . Unfortunately it will stop production recently , so catch the last change to have a new one  
2	  I absolutely loved Shade of the Maple and could not put it down ! Anna was very real to me , and I became totally absorbed into her story as if it were my own . Kirk Martin has a gift for writing such moving , inspiring stories with great depth . Fortunately , I just found out he has a new novel on the way soon called The Gravel Drive , which sounds very powerful : The Gravel Drive is a metaphor for the connection between a father and his son . Nightmare becomes reality when the boy is discovered missing . At a detective 's urging , the father keeps a journal to record thoughts that may provide clues to finding his son . In these pages we witness a man 's transformation , as introspection exposes pretense and truth yields understanding of what it is to be a father . Penetrating insight into human nature ( and the thoughts that plague the parents of missing children ) under girds the drama of the search for a little boy .. last seen walking down the gravel drive . It is this search that ultimately leads to discovery of life 's greatest truth : there can be no love without sacrifice , no redemption without loss . I can't wait to read this , too !  
1	  The sound was good , even decent bass which is unusual for small speakers . But the construction was poor . The wiring connections were weak , and the power supply died after just a couple days of use . We were in the mountains at the time and I just recycled them , not even worth returning for replacement as I wouldn't want another set of these . Bought them on the name . Looking for better .  
2	  While simply browsing my local Target store for a particular Lexmark printer , scanner , copier ( around $ .. everywhere else ) I happened up on the HP PSC 2210 ALL-IN-ONE . ON CLEARANCE , REGULARLY $ .. I couldn't believe , naturally I grabbed it up and could not be happier . Photos print beautifully . My digital camera takes good pictures , but this printer makes them great .  
1	  This M type XD card was not compatible for my olympus camera . a waste of money . make sure you check your cameras compatibility with these cards .  
1	  Product did not operate as advertised . Very difficult to get any speed reading from any direction or distance from pitcher to catcher . Was able to get speeds of passing cars , but worked poorly for baseball pitching .  
1	  Don't waste your money and time on this junk . I bought 2 100 spindles , I got 15 consecutive coasters from my first spindles . I thought it was just my luck with the first spindle , then I got another 10 coasters from the second spindle . 100 % failure rate , incredible ! DON'T buy ! LANDFILLED MATERIAL ! JUNK ! TRASH !  
2	  I bought this keyboard as a replacement based on some reviews read , and really wasn't sure whether I 'd like it . Turned out to be a great buy as I really like the light touch needed on the keys . Obviously , the feel of a keyboard is rather personal and subjective , and your preferences could be a bit different , but I found it very comfortable and easy to adjust to . Furthermore , it 's a full mac keyboard complete with the f-keys , etc , and at around $ 23 including shipping it is a great value . I liked it so much I bought another one for use at home . Great buy overall .  
1	  I bought this card with the hopes of an easy installation on my W2K notebook . Getting it to work with a non-Linksys wireless hub took several frustrating evenings . The documention that came with the device and on the Linksys web site was absolutely useless . The installation software had conflicts with the firewall software so I had to remove both the firewall and linksys software and reinstall the software . Getting the 128 bit WEP configuration to work required asking a consultant for help . Apparently , you must enter the long security code versus the network access password . This obscure nuance was not obviously noted in the manual or on line documentation . I 'm sure it is a little more straight forward if your network is all one brand but getting this device to work in a mixed brand environment was difficult and I should have listened to the consultant and bought the NetGear card .  
1	  I reviewed a variety of audio preamps . I needed two channels and little sophistication in the device . I purchased this GE product because I thought the brand name would represent some degree of reliability . What I recieved was a device with one working channel and one totally inoperative channel . The single channel which is working is adiquate , but I thought I would have two . If this random sample of one represents what you want when you buy GE , go ahead and purchase . But , you have been warned , GE is no better than any off shore no name brand . The wrapper is written by a native English speaker and other indications looked good . The product is a failure .  
2	  this is an easy-to-use but excellent dvd player . the thinness of it is very convenient and the product / hardware is very stylish . picture is clear .  
2	  I have had these speakers now for two weeks . I have excellent hearing and I do get the hiss that everyone talks about . Still fiddling around with them as far as placement and that . Have them hooked up to a Mac G5 via the toslink cable . They do sound great except for that annoying hiss . Other than that I would definately recommend them . Good price from Amazon .  
1	  Designed obsolescence is the word that best discribes Delorme No support !  
2	  I 've had this product for about 8 months now and have had no problems . The sound is extremely clear no matter if I am playing music using a CD or my iPod . There are also other input options that I don't really use . My one big complaint ( lack of 5 stars ) is that here is no input / output option that allows me to port my sound from my TV through the speakers . Otherwise , a great product !  
1	  Device hooked up and Rhapsody radio stations would not play . when e-mailed tech support , they caimed I should go to Rhapsody to " fine tune " the Rhapsody client . They were not able to help in any way and refused to send me to second level tech support or to offer an opion on removal re-install of product . This product is not ready for the market and potential purchasers are warned that if they want the Rhapsody radio stations they will be disapointed .  
1	  Cable did not work on my laptop to HDTV . Checked continuity between pins and only 10 of the 15 pins were connected . Not worth the return postage .  
1	  I think the designers of this camera spent so much time making it look cute and slick that they forgot to actually try it out . I returned mine in 3 days . It was the biggest piece of junk I 've ever bought . The picture quality stunk . My old 2 MP Sony took pictures 10 times crisper . There were problems with the focus . The flash was weak . It 'll illuminate your subject 's face , but forget about background . Indoors , the backgrouund will come out all black . It 's garbage . If you 're considering buying this camera , you 're better off choosing something of comparable price with your eyes shut .  
2	  This keyb is great . With this , and Documents To Go , the handheld is a great laptop replacement handling most wordprocessing and simple spreadsheet applications with ease . The keyb is small , light , and comfortable . The cool factor is very high the way it opens up . And , yes , you do get second glances when sitting in the coffee shop and writing your latest novel . Works really well with the Sony PDAs with 16 Mb ram in them .. makes it convenient to store all those documents .  
1	  You can find refill kits of quality in for both the 16 Black and the 26 color . For $ 30.00 you can get two refills of black and two refills of color .  
2	  I purchased a D-Link DI-704 to replace a software firewall / router package that I had been using . The - 704 worked right out of the box , and I had my network back on line in less than 15 minutes . The advertised features of the - 704 work very well , and the current firmware ( v2.55b15 ) supports PPTP VPN connections with no problems . Things I 'd like to see in the - 704 ( but don't ) include downloadable access logs and the ability to forward a connection on one port to a different port on the local network . The web-based configuration tool is straightforward to use ; that 's a good thing , since the user 's manual is not very detailed , out of date in places , and omits some important topics ( firmware upgrades , console mode features ) entirely . If you have computer networking experience , you won't have any problem installing the - 704 . If you don't , it would be good to learn a little about networking first . But overall , I 'm very impressed - the D-Link DI-704 is a great product at a very reasonable price .  
1	  Own this lens but very disappointed with the image quality . My cheap Canon 50mm f1.8 lens produced much superior images . Would probably trade-in for Canon 16-35mm or 17-40mm lens in the near future .  
2	  The latest isn't necessarily the best . I chose the Palm IIx , rather than the Palm V , because of its flexibility , upgrade ability and larger memory . I 'm glad I did . It substitutes for all sorts of bulkier electronics and on-paper tasks . It travels everywhere with me and keeps me current . Highly recommended !  
2	  The Sony DSC-P9 is my second digital camera . I only have it for a few weeks now , but I have to admit , this loaded little gadget is a great companion . Not only is it small enough , but with it 's solid Aluminum body I really have it in my pocket most of the time . No need to repeat all the technical specs here . Overall the camera has an excellent price / value ratio . Be sure to buy enough 128M sticks .. you will play with MPEG-HQX , be warned . The video editing software included only creates MPEG-1 , so don't forget to download VirtualDub ( free software , GPL ) . Have fun and great shots ! Jan  
1	  Having owned several HP printers over many years , I have noticed a steady and unforgivable decline in the quality of this company 's printers with each successive model . The final straw for me is the 7960 , by far the worst HP printer I have owned . While producing acceptable prints under most conditions , this printer 's liabilities far outweigh its benefits . The workmanship of the unit itself is the flimsiest and most disappointing I have encountered . And the printer 's lack of consistent compatibility with the two separate computers I have used it with is both annoying and inexcusable for a supposedly renowned printer company . Bad drivers have caused numerous problems and the driver updates usually make the situation only marginally better . Plus the printer 's general overuse of ink and poor paper and envelope handling make the overall experience of owning one distinctly unappealing . This is my last HP printer - I 'll be switching to Epson .  
2	  Had absolutely no problems purchasing or redeeming this code . Simple process , saves you going out to buy a card . Smooth transaction .  
1	  I bought this router and a Linksys wireless card 1-1/2 years ago . The router crapped out at the end of its 1-year warranty and they sent me a replacement . It lasted 6 months and crapped out , but since my total warranty period was 1-year , I have to buy a new router . The wireless card lasted until a month ago and I replaced it with a Belkin card with a " lifetime " warranty . Linksys Tech support was exported to India and they try but the language problem is there . I will not buy Linksys products again .  
1	  After weeks of giving myself a chance to adapt to it , I 've decided that this keyboard and mouse set may be " ergonomic " for some species , but homo-sapiens isn't one of them . The mouse fits the hand like a grapefruit with a scroll-wheel , and allowed me to finally experience what using " the computer " must feel like for my left-handed 90 year old mother . And the keyboard goes back in the box with a well deserved nickname : " The Typo Factory " . If you order this item , be sure to hang on to the original packaging .  
1	  I have had an Epson CX5400 for a little over a year and it just died . While it was working it was able to print photos and text at a decent quality , but it was terriblely slow . I called Epson to help troubleshoot my problem and they pretty much told me that the problem was caused by leaving the computer turn on when it was not in use . This was my first time hearing of this causing the problem . I believe I 'm going to replace it with something different .  
2	  Ordered this item , installed it immediatelty as my battery was dead . Installation was a perfect fit . Slight colour difference .. no big deal . I 'm now portable again !  
1	  I got this camera from my uncle like 3 years ago . I was so excited when I got it but it doesn't really work . The batteries run out really quick and it 's really hard to put them on to the computer . There 's no flash so I couldn't take nighttime pictures . The pictures come out blurry and overall it 's worth the price because it barely functions .. I wouldn't buy it !  
2	  Open box . Insert batteries . Take outside . Push power on button . When location is " captured " ( there 's a progress bar noting satellite acquisition ) , velcro on wrist . Push button for starting your walk or run . Go for your walk or run . At conclusion , press stop button . Read pace and distance . Press power off button . That 's how easy this was to operate the first time . I 've now used it for 6 six mile runs . Yes , I 've been drooling over theGarmin Forerunner 305 GPS Receiver With Heart Rate Monitor , but you can pick this 101 model for under a hundred dollars . Give it a try , and see if a GPS unit works for you . And if you do upgrade to a 305 , well , now you have a backup , or can attach it to your bike . I 'm 6 foot tall , and this might seem big on a smaller person 's wrist . It 's okay for me , and the digital readouts are very easy to read while running . There are other bells and whistles , including a virtual running buddy to pace yourself , compass directions to your starting point , lap information , and more . But I really wanted an accurate note of my time and distance . So my Manoa Valley run went from 5.5 to 6.0 miles ( Gmaps Pedometer versus this Forerunner ) , and my Diamond Head run went from 6.0 to 6.6 miles . In both cases , I suspect the Forerunner was the more accurate ( in Gmaps Pedometer , you have to straighten some curved trails ) . BUT .. you can lose signal contact in dense vegetation . I 'm going to have fun with this !  
2	  Bought a new windows 7 computer 64 Bit . Had to find a way to get my Palm Z22 to work . It took a little playing around , finally got it to work .  
2	  this is my first HDD ive ever bought . im glad i came on amazon and read all the user reviews and compared because i was thinking about getting a seagate one but they posed to have alot of problems . the thing that got me hoocked on this HDD was its plug and play feature . it trully is plug and play . i can honesly say that this is the best invesment ive ever made on a product due to what it does , and how many times its saved me . Im sad and happy to say that it was dropped for the first time by my friend off a computer desk 3 days ago , he tripped on the wire and it fell about 4-5 feet to the ground , and to my amazment it still works . unlike my MP3 player :(  
1	  I loved this product at first , a flawless and easy portable set up . But after about 6 months it totally falls apart and the place where the ipod connects moves and it is very hard for it to stand up .. and also GREATLY effects the sound . AFTER 6 MONTHS IT IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS EVEN AFTER GOOD CARE . Now it actually doesnt even charge .. idk wtf is with that . after battling with keeping the ipod upright to play it ( putting pieces of paper behind it to keep it proped up ) , not it just WILL NOT CHARGE ITSELF OR THE IPOD . JUNK !  
1	  I bought this product less than a year ago . 2 days ago , I locked my laptop and tried to unlock it . But I couldn't . It was somehow messed up and the combination did not work . I HAD TO CUT IT ! I don't know how it got messed up but I 'm sure that it was not study enough to last long .  
1	  Not at all happy with this device . The claim " compatible with all serial devices " the reality is it is not . I wanted to connect my LaserWriter to my iMac ( serial to USB ) . After much frustration I called Belkin and was told that this product does not support LaserWriter printers . Belkin was not very helpful and returning the product means I am out the shipping . If you are considering this product call to get specific compatiblity specs .  
2	  I 've used these before . I prefer to hardwire my radar detectors . I can't stand the coiled cord hanging down the dash for the cigarrette lighter . This a cheap solution .  
2	  I use these headphones while on the treadmill and the eliptical . They stay steady and the sound is great . Liked them so much , i got my husband his own pair .  
1	  I read the product reviews before buying this and thought it would be nice to use for our Wii system instead of countless alkaline batteries . It turned out to be a waste of time . The batteries take a few hours to charge and that 's OK . But when they only have a working charge of just 5 minutes in a Wii remote , they cause more harm by interrupting the game with ' lost communication ' failures . Even when executing the loonngg ' refresh ' charge cycle , the batteries fared no better . The charger says the batteries are fully charged when I take them out , but they don't have the right stuff for practical use . I can't recommend this product and suggest you look elsewhere for a rechargeable solution .  
2	  abiout this camera i can say that this is great .. amazing picture clarity , i am a student and all my friends , inspite of there camera ask for mine because of the clarity . cons : memory , but thats fine if u plan to buy a card .. i dont mind buying that , as anyways u have to buy one .  
2	  Product has been working fine for a month , so I have no complaints about it . Friend set up , so can't comment on ease of set up .  
1	  This is the biggest farce from Logitech . Apple OS 9 requires an inputsprocket or config file for this joystick . Logitech does not have one . Contact Logitech support to get this to work and they tell me that they do not support Apple OS anything , that the USB and joystick are " Mac Compatible " which is like saying that you can use a tennis ball to play golf if you wanted . There is no support for this . There are no Mac users that have ever got this to work without dumping time and $ into configuring a third party app to interface with this . I have returned mine and am looking into something that actually does work with Apple OS ( X or 9 )  
2	  I have really been enjoying the Forerunner 101 since purchasing it a few weeks ago . I love the freedom of varying my running routes without worrying about not having an exact measurement of the distance I 've run . Here are a few comments about the product : - After double-checking my routes in the car and comparing them to my Forerunner 's calculations , it seems to be pretty accurate with distance measurements . It is possible that it is sometimes off by . 10 mile or so , but that is usually close enough to satisfy me . - It can sometimes take as long as 5 minutes to initially locate the signal . This is a minor inconvenience but one I can live with . - It doesn't seem to be capable of picking up a strong signal with a lot of tree overhang . This is disappointing because I would like to use it for trail running and hiking . - The AA batteries work well as a power source . I purchased the rechargeable type of AA batteries for convenience . One should probably keep an eye on the battery life indicator on the Forerunner and go ahead and put in a fresh pair of batteries when the battery indicator gets down to one line .  
2	  I saw a review from an alleged electrician that claimed this wire was not copper . I hate to contradict someones review , but this wire is copper . It also true 16 gauge unlike some other cables I have seen . This product is a great deal , so why pay more for another item .  
1	  I bought a ipod mini and was so excited , when i opened the box the ipod cant charge and even read in the computer i tried doing everything i can to turn it on or charge it . I went to [ .. ] they told me everything to turn it on and nothing this seller and product is not recommended  
1	  I bought this camera because it had several favorable reviews . Unfortunately , it was a major dissapointment . The flash has a mind of its own , the pics quality is mediocre and it 's definitely over priced . I guess this camera doesn't have much competition in the market hence its popularity . It 's a piece of expensive junk .  
2	  These headphones are legendary . I got these because they were recommended by my teacher for sound engineering . There are others a lot more expensive , i did not get to compare them , but I really don't need to , this works great . You can hear everything , this is great for mixing or listening for errors in your music or just listening to music in general . You will hear a lot of detail on these that you won't hear with other headphones or regular speakers . It also slightly cancels the surrounding noise even though they are not noise canceling headphones . They are not extremely bass heavy so if you boost the bass too much it will distort ( but that 's not what they 're designed for anyways ) . This is an all around great product , it does what it 's designed to do .  
1	  DO NOT PURCHASE THESE . These are not good headphones for the price you can buy much better ones . They broke after a few months . I managed to fix them and then the other side fell off . Not good sound quality . Everyone around you can hear what your lsitening to and you can hear everything around you when you use these . Very poorly made cheap materials . My friend also had a pair of these which broke on her too after only a couple of months .  
1	  Windows XP refused to load the drivers from both the install disk and from their website . This happened on two different systems . The install disk has drivers for several devices , so it was difficult even finding which one to pick . In the end , none of them worked .  
1	  What a piece of junk ! I got this camera from another retailer two years ago . The first year and a half it worked great . The pictures were clear and sharp , the colors bright . It was a good web cam also . Then one day it stopped working outdoors . The pictures are nothing but white . Not even the photo editing software can get rid of the whiteness . I thought it was just me but a little research has yielded hundreds of orther horror stories about this camera and Fuji 's unwillingness to fix the problem .. Save your money .  
1	  I was having some problem with my MacBook Pro , and I was instructed by Apple Service Representative to remove the battery from the battery compartment which is on the bottom of the MacBook Pro , and hit the " shift " button for two seconds , and replace the battery to correct the problem . But , since I have attached the Speck MacBook Pro 15 " See-Thru Hard Case onto my MacBook Pro , I find it impossible to remove the bottom piece of the hard case to expose the battery compartment . I know the only way to get to the battery compartment is to crack and break the bottom piece of the hard case , and I do not want to sacrifice my hard case which I just purchased recently . Can you help me and give me instruction on how to remove the bottom piece of the hard case without breaking it ? If its possible , then , I can give this item a different rating ! At this time , its a 1 star or less !  
2	  Amazing how much memory they 're getting for space now . Almost TOO small , but fun and easy to use .  
2	  The product was in excellent conditions . I am going to enjoy it a lot . Thank you very much . Better than described !  
1	  When looking for a card scanner that would work with my Macintosh computer , the ad for this scanner state that it would work with both PC and MAC computers , which caused me to purchase this item . When received , it became apparent that it did not work with MAC Computers . Very disappointing , indeed . I was able to sell this one to a friend who needed one for her PC , which relieved me of having to try returning the item . Please make sure that all copy is correct .  
2	  All the accompanying reviews are really excellent . So what more could I add ? Well , just to make the point of how amazing this radio is , I will propose you a TEST . For years I heard a claim stating that to know how good a Hi-Fi system is , just use it to play a piano " solo " recording . I tried it with my iPAL and am still amazed . How can such a little radio perform so well ! ? Since 1 test is 1000 words worth , I suggest you to perform the same test . After that , if you already got one , will surely be even prouder and happier , else , if don't own one yet , will surely buy the radio without hesitation .  
1	  I researched all USB thumb drives before I bought this , my first one . It has a nice form factor and sufficient capacity at the time . I figured I would have daily use for it , but it was eventually used only a few times a week . One day I dropped it , and not from a considerable height mind you , and the little button that slides the USB attachment out no longer " stuck " in the out position , which meant you had to hold it in place when you inserted it into an outlet . That was a minor annoyance . THEN after a few months , it failed on me for no reason whatsoever . Now , I am good with my products , and nothing ever fails on me that quickly UNLESS it 's a faulty product . A friend bought the same thing and it too failed on him . If he told me he was buying it , I would 've warned against it as I am warning you now . I like SanDisk , but this product is not good . Get a Cruzer Crossfire instead , preferably one that doesn't needs to be " pushed out " .  
1	  Bought this for my son for college , initially sound quality was great , in fact his brothers would use it for outdoor parties etc . Then something went amiss and the the unit kept shutting down . Tried to troubleshoot and that did not work . It is now in garbage :-( So , it only lasted about 1 year . Looking for another and hope it lasts longer .  
2	  It 's OEM Cannon toner . what 's not to love but the price ? Well the price isn't even a concern when it 's on the company Amex . I go through about 1 of these every year in my home office Cannon multi function center . Unit is almost 6 years old now and all it does is print print print .  
1	  Unfortunately , I was one of the morons that purchased this piece of junk . I have had this printer since 12/04 and every time I attempt to use it , something isn't working . I have printed approxmately 20 or so picture in total . This time , the printer will only prints half pictures . I called Kodak and was advised to download their new software . I did that and now the printer won't work at all . The lady told me to send the printer in as they have had lots of problems with them . She then asked for my credit card number and that was all she wrote . She tells me they are having trouble with the printers , but I have to pay . I wrote the CEO and no response , so they don't back their product either . Kodak is in trouble and I wonder why ?  
2	  I 've had mine for about three months now and absolutely love it . Pros : Best picture quality of any HDTV I 've ever seen , period . Excellent clarity , true black point , 179.9 degree viewing angle . Easy to use . Great warranty . Cons : 190lbs - however I 've never had a reason to move it since I initially set it up . Two people can lift it pretty easily , just use gloves . My * only * real complaint about this set is there 's no way to read the full description of a channel when watching ATSC broadcasts . It only shows you the first ~ 100 characters of the channel description and then cuts it off . PBS always has really long channel descriptions . :-/ If you 're considering buying an HDTV you need to look at one of these sets so you at least have a standard to compare other HDTVs against . The KD-34XBR970 is the gold standard for what HD can look like .  
1	  The actual metal plate that mates with the back of the chassis was much too long for my case ( Silverstone TJ08-E ) . I had to do major surgery and mate it with another PCI slot cover to get it to fit in the slot . So far it is working now that it is mounted . If it had fit in my case without modification I would have given it five stars .  
1	  This mouse clicks twice when you press the button once ( and no , I didn't set the software to do it . ) Everything else is great but unless you want that - don't buy it !  
2	  I was very happy with my purchase . It arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised . I have owned a Canon i80 printer for 5yrs now and I love the printing quality . The ink cartridges are a great deal here at Amazon . Also , I got free shipping as a Prime member .  
1	  I bought this TV for my mother as a holiday gift . She is 67 years old and needed assistance in setting it up ; to which I was much obliged to do . While I was lowering the TV onto the stand the TV slipped off of the stand and very nearly sliced open my finger to the bone . Suffice to say it ruined our holiday , and I guarantee that if my hand met such a misfortune that there are other people that have suffered my same fate . The back of the TV has a thin steel frame that hugs the top part of the mounting , the steel is so thin that if it is dropped on your hand be prepared for instant gouging . It is a good TV as far as the picture , however the unit itself was not designed with safety in mind . I have a 52 inch LCD Sony Bravia that was lighter to carry and easier to lower onto the stand , and has a better picture . I am hoping that my finger heals quickly ; for those with the spirit of adventure feel free to look at the photos of my incident . Best of luck to all ! Photos :[ .. ]  
2	  I bought this camera after extensive research and it has lived up to its almost unanimous accolades . It is small but fits nicely in the hand and feels balanced and substantial - not light and cheap . It packs so many features I am still rereading the manual . Flesh tones and white balancing seem very accurate on Auto but everything can be controlled manually if you wish . It seems to use power better than other cameras I 've used ; I can go several days without recharging or replacing my batteries ( Ialways carry a spare , fully charged set ) . The software on the Macintosh is well designed . My daughter and I created a 360 degree QuickTime VR file of our living room in minutes . Canon recently released Mac OS X software and it functions beautifully . So far I could not be more pleased with my purchase .  
1	  I have an 160 gig ipod with a ton of music on it and this unit has the worst navigation for an ipod thats on the market . I bought this item because it offered everything I wanted , but if I had the choice to do over-i would run for the hills . This unit is a piece of garbage . Go Apline  
1	  What a present . What a disappointment . Go Video , you should be ashamed . This player has known defects , and you have to know it . As with others who have posted , the unit worked fine playing the first DVD , but after the first , the picture froze , and when it finally advanced , it jumped around like a jumping bean . .. This is a gift giver 's worst nightmare . I won't make this mistake again .  
2	  Item is the same as buying locally yet it is only a fraction of the cost . Very happy with the fast service .  
1	  Be warned : the promotional pictures of this GPS unit show street-level maps , but the unit as shipped includes only major highways and city names . To get the kind of detail suggested by the marketing pictures on this site , you have to spend more than $ 100 extra to buy maps .  
2	  The bottom of the bag is solid . We only have a camera , a flash , and one lense in it , but the sturdy , velcro fastened sections keep them firmly in place . There are roomy side pockets for lense filters , covers , and other misc . items needed for the camera . We still have space in the bag for two more lenses . I looked around at different items before buying this item here . Amazon had it for the best price . I would suggest if you are looking to get it as a gift and want the free shipping , to order it at least a month ahead to be assured you will get it on time . It 's amazing how just a few dollars for shipping speeds up their processing .  
2	  Purchased these at the recommendation of a friend who said " wide angle " binoculars are the way to go for NFL games . I followed his recommendation and these work great - brings you up close to the action at the other end of the field . The wide angle includes the entire O-Line - not just a single player . The swivel style focusing button is a great improvement over the dial focus on my old binoculars - a touch of the button brings you into focus . Very good ! Unit comes with a nice roomy case . Some reviews I read complained of a cheap plastic strap , but someone must of heard and improved on that complaint . The strap is very durable and fits fine . Another convenience is the light weight - no more of the neck tugging downward pressure when you wear the binoculars over your neck . Easy to carry on the hike from the parking lot to the stadium , too , owing to light weight and smaller size than traditional binoculars .  
2	  Sony Company is always selling very good items . I very happy so far with the battery charger . Thank you !  
1	  The only issue I had until about a week ago is that the cables they sell to go with this switch do not support DVI-D connections directly . You have to use a DVI-I to DVI-D adapter to plug them into the computer side ( DVI-D ports are very common on built in video , but much less common on stand alone video cards ) . It is not ideal but the converters are available pretty cheaply here and elsewhere so it is not a major issue . Then all the sudden it just broke one day while it wasn't in use . The USB just stopped working after about 2 years . So now I am back to moving cables between computers or having multiple mice . Given the high price of this switch , having to replace it every couple years is not acceptable . If it didn't break it would probably be 4 stars . Not perfect , but a decent option . But I can't recommend it as is .  
2	  Maptech 's Terrain Navigator is great on your home computer , but Maptech also has a product called the Pocket Navigator that runs on Compaq Ipacs that you can take out in the field with you too ! What will they think of next ? Now you can take their same USGS Topo Maps , download them onto your pocket pc , and as your hiking see exactly where you are ! ( sorry folks , doesn't work with the palm pilot ) You can even hook it up to there new GPS unit the Navman ! They have great info about this product on their website ( .. ) you should check it out ! I did and I love it !  
2	  This camera takes very good pictures . The only major drawback is that it is a battery hog . If you buy this camera make sure you buy at least two sets of rechargeable batteries and a recharger that can recharge them quickly . You will be amazed at how quick this camera can kill batteries . The camera takes very good pictures and offers a lot of features that might be too much for the average user . If you want a simple point and shoot digital camera this is not for you . If you are buying for high quality pictures and a lot of features you will love this camera . The reason I gave it four stars is because of how fast it goes through batteries . There is nothing worse than wanting to take a picture and realizing that both sets of batteries are dead . This has infuriated me many times over .  
2	  I was looking to camera that will be in the pocket to take the kids pictures . So the main requirements were : 1 . Fast startup2 . Fast picture taking3 . Good performance in slow ISO . 4 . quality5 . lightweightGreat value for the money . Highly recommended .  
1	  The pot performed as advertised , but the taste was not at all as expected . Our old " on the burner " perculator produces fine coffee , but this automatic job doesn't cut it . Changed brands and amount of coffee to no avail . I believe the problem is that it boils the coffee too fast .  
2	  This battery took a charge and has been holding it for a few months . Better option than replacing the phone .  
2	  This product is solid , and it gave me no difficulty . It was perfect for hooking up to my roommate 's old tube tv . That being said , if you have an HDMI input on your TV , or whatever you 're linking up to , just get a DVI to HDMI converter . They 're about 10 to 20 bucks on NewEgg and will give you a much better picture than this will . ( Plus , most HDTV sets will talk to your computer and automatically set the display size when you use HDMI ; this product will not ) .  
1	  The VCR side works fine but I rarely need to use it . The DVD player stinks . Half of my movies aren't recognized by the player , some of them won't go past the menu screen , often it freezes and skips ( not fun in the middle of a TaeBo workout LOL ) and it won't play any of my DVDs made on the computer . All of these things work perfectly in other players . As soon as I convince my husband that the player is defective and it 's not the DVDs as he thinks , we will return it and get a different brand .  
2	  Great stuff . Looked around and thought the pioneer was best , bought this on sale for a little over 400 and consider it worth every penny . About 35 minutes setup time . Only complaint is that I had to go out and buy addtional cords to hook it up to my TV for TV sound , but that is more a complaint with all of these " out of the box " systems . It really has terrific sound - deep and solid bass and the raindrops in Forest Gump ( Vietnam scene ) are crystal clear . The picture is equally as clear . Would definately recomend to a friend .  
2	  I am a network VAR and a reseller of computer network hardware . I am also authorized service for most major printer manufacturers . I have NEVER had to replace a board on ANY device plugged into one of these . They do hum , they generate some heat ( minor efficiency consideration ) and they click . The clicking means the internal relay is switching transformer tape to maintain consistent line voltage at the output and that means it 's working . You probably don't want one of these sitting right next to you if your power stinks and it 's not a UPS so it doesn't help in the event the power goes out but it is spectacular protection for devices like printers , copiers , home theater gear or anything else that 's expensive and you don't want to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars replacing boards in . I 've been using and selling these for years but bought the last one from Amazon since it was cheaper than from my normal vendors . If it does it 's job you 'll think you wasted your money . Highly recommended .  
1	  I asked for this for christmas , I was extremely happy with it , before I took any pictures . It is really nice to look at , but when you want to take a picture , it is dark . If you use the flash even remotely close to someone then they get like washed out to a white color , they flash blinds my friends , it sounds like an old camera flash and kind of goes POOF and pops when you use it . It scared my dog , the flash sent her into a corner scared . When you are trying to take a picture you cant use the LCd unless you are in bright sunlight outside , which then dont even come out great , the LCD is almost always black , i made sure it was on , and i played around with all the settings , it doesnt come with good instrutions . Very higly dissapointed , i do not reccommended this  
2	  I just bought this portable CD player at my local Wal-Mart and now I couldn't be happier . This is the best CD player I 've ever owned . It 's got a cool design and it plays CD 's very well . I would strongly recommend that people purchase this item .  
2	  Was shopping around for a camcorder for awhile , and was debating against a mini dv and or dvd camcorder . Panasonic even has 3ccd camcorders at a comparable price offering supposedely a better quality camera . I had my heart set on a dvd camcorder as I didnt want the hassle of transferring to PC and then burning to dvd . Knowing myslef , I would just never get around do doing it . So after having my mind set on a dvd camcorder , looked on the internet and there was the sony 403 , the specs looked good but there werent that many reviews posted . Decided to go with it , and I must say it is one fantastic camcorder , quality is great , low light is not that bad either . Built in flash for stills work great and quality still quality is great also . I have no need for my digital camera anymore . Is convenient to store both video and stills on the same dvd . Havent used the software for editing yet , from the reviews ive read it isnt that great , but dont expect to to do that much editing . Finalizing the dvd creates an own dvd menu , again great feature . Touch screen is A + , 16:9 recording works well . 5.1 surround sound is great add on . Battery life on packaged battery gives good recording time . I was skeptical of the only 30 min recording time on SP mode on the camera . mini dv 's offer 60 min , but after recording a couple of dvd , you really don't realize how long 30 minutes is . SHould be ample for a standard home video . There is a setting at LP mode for 60 minutes , haven ; t tried it yet , but will . My guess is that I won't notice a big difference . Overall my opinion is that if your the average user , wants great quality footage easy to use , this camcorder is for u . I personally cant tell the difference between a 3ccd camera . It is pricey , but i think sony has set a new standard in DVD camcorders .  
2	  It 's a good deal . I use this as a lens protector and it works pretty well . Also the UV filter also makes the picture with better colors  
1	  I ordered the 75-822 in May of 2006 . The receiver went " deaf " in August and I returned it to Midland for warranty repair . They sent me a replacment in September , and by November the receiver had failed in the new one . The radio will not pick up anything even with the squelch all the way down . When the radio would receive signals , the audio was so distorted that you could not understand what was being said . The transmitter in both units still worked . Don't waste your money .  
2	  I purchased this remote because it was supposed to be easy to program .. I had no idea it was THIS easy .. it works terrificly with my DirecTV HR20 / A / V Receiver / DVD Recorder / and HDTV ..  
1	  Instead of buying and installing this webcam , I would 've had a poor-quality pizza followed by a few drinks in a pub I don't like and a ride home in a dodgy taxi . It took me a couple of hours to get it all working , and I feel a bit more confident about what webcams are about . This is my first webcam , and I only bought it because it was the cheapest . My policy is to get the cheapest of anything so that I understand it , then throw it away and get something better . This webcam really is pretty bad , but then again I haven't lost much money . I 'll look for something better next weekend .  
1	  When I read it was tested with more than 100 printers , I assumed it would work with my 3 home printers . After all , they are HP , the most common printers outthere . Not so ! Turned out , it worked with my HP Photosmart 8450 , but didn't work with my HP Laserjet 1018 nor with HP Laserjet 3330 . Disappointing experience .  
1	  We got this about two years ago from Sam 's Club . It has been nothing but trouble . We returned the first system because it wouldn't read any discs . The second system has multiple problems : ( 1 ) It won't read the CDs or DVDs at least 50 % of the time . No kidding , sometimes I put 5 discs in there and it will cycle through all five and then finally say " NO DISC . " There is nothing wrong with the discs ; sometimes I can get them to work after multiple tries ( and sometimes not ) . ( 2 ) The surround sound usually does not work . My husband gave me a Post-It Note that we keep on the system with a series of steps we have to take to reset it so that the blue light comes on . ( 3 ) When they do work , the back speakers hiss . Even though Amazon no longer carries this unit I was searching to find out if there was any recall or anyone else with the same problems . We registered it on the Samsung website to see if they come up with a recall notice . ( We were about to dump our Canon digital camera recently when it stopped working - it was past warranty - but my husband found out it had a recall on it . They fixed it without charge . )  
2	  This little analog radio gets great reception and is just what I was looking for . Originally I thought it had come with no ear buds , but they were in fact in the bottom of the box . Hey ! I 'm old , what can I say . Anyway , I started short wave listening in 1960 . This little radio gets better & clearer reception then anything I had back then . Analog is not easy as digital , but more fun . It takes a little getting use to if you haven't done it . I have had the radio only a few days & have logged quite a few distant stations . The fm & am quality is equal to that of the short wave  
1	  This came in on the latter ( and cheaper ) end of the long line of excellent Palm products , and is a very easy to use , ergonimaclly friendly toy . Yes , I said toy because unfortunately it 's just too out of date . You can now have as many features on your cellphone as this offers , and even at under $ 40 - buying something that has only 2MB of memory and is not upgradeable is simply a waste . No offence to Palm , I like their products , and have had several , but please wake up and smell the future ! There are now a great many affordable PDA 's out there that you can do so much more with , and products like this , however well made have just been left behind . For example , at still under $ 100 is the Hewlett Packard Jornada 525 Color Pocket PC - upgradeable and has ten times the power and functions . Save your money , and buy something more modern .  
2	  Aunque es dificil la instalacion de los drivers . tuve que desintalar los drivers creative de mi X-fi xtreme music ( que son los mismos ) para que pueda reconocerla . El sonido es de lo mejor con mis logitech Z 5300 .  
1	  We purchased this product just over a year ago . The battery began to discharge very quickly and then eventually the unit shut off . We now cannot turn the unit back on . It 's dead .. dead .. dead . We plug it in using the power adapter and an AC adapter we purchased . Apparently , there is some sort of switch defect , which causes the power switch mounts to break easily . Because our limited warranty just expired , we 'll have to send it for repair , which is now almost the cost of the device new . The number of times we used the power switch is not many since we generally kept it plugged in and running in the car . It mostly shut off automatically . However , when the battery once discharged because we did not have a power cord , we finally had to use the power switch . If someone else has suggestions as to this problem , let me know . I give it two stars because when the unit did work , we enjoyed it and it lead us in the right direction 95 % of the time . The UI navigation is pretty easy to learn and use . I would have preferred a QWERTY keyboard . Maybe this is an option , but I could not find it . That 's probably in the manual right next to where it says " don't use the power switch too much . "  
2	  I have been using the garmin 7500 ( without the dead-reckoning cable attached , with the XM Radio Antenna ) since March 2006 and have loved the unit . The screen is large and very easy to read . I 've used the unit mounted on a dash-board and sitting in our cup-holders . In both cases the system found my location with at least 3 or 4 satellites and worked well . While driving through the mountains , in tree covered roads I will often lose the XM signal , and occasionally lose the GPS . I believe the GPS would be improved once I install the dead-reckoning cable . I greatly appreciate the ability to connect directly to my computer and download updates , languages , points of interest , extras , and the ability to change the start-up screen to an image of my choice . It has also helped to have the SD card for storing music and audiobooks while driving . While the navigation system is excellent , the XM interface and MP3 player is only average . The MP3 player has no way to fast-forward or reverse within a track , which is ok for music but hard for audiobooks . The XM service would be better if it stored the last 30 minutes of audio ( as most units do today ) and it was easier to switch between preset channels ( it currently requires about 4 clicks , and you can only store 6 channels per preset ) . The navigation has been excellent . The maps are up to date and I believe updates will occur when synchronizing with the computer . It is essential to read the manual . Most features come as extra downloads when connecting to the Garmin service , which isn't clear from working with the unit . The large screen makes the 7500 a bad choice for cars and SUV 's with small front windows . The screen blocks quite a bit of the window . This isn't the case in our minivan , but would be unusable in vehicles with less window space . Overall this is a great product , and I recommend it to others .  
2	  I originally thought this one played videos too , but my daughter loves it . She has all her favorite songs and family pics and podcasts . It was so easy to use we didn't even need directions .  
1	  I have gotten two of these devices and both have locked up on me . There is no support online and no one can figure out how to reset it . Don't waste your money !  
1	  I highly recommend you not to buy this as this doesnt have any extra storage space . Even power adapter case is quite snuggly and I am repenting buying this item . I cant even store my ipod in this case . The finishing of the product is smooth and leather quality is descent . But its not multipurpose .  
1	  The summary for this product says : " Provides wireless connectivity for any USB-enabled computer . " However , when I went to the DLink web site ( $U$ ) and downloaded the instruction manual , I found its system requirements listed as " Windows XP / 2000 " which does not include any of the USB-enabled computers I own . I am fortunate that I didn't go through the trouble of ordering it and waiting for it to arrive , only to have to return it . I wish Amazon would include the actual system requirements for all computer related products in a prominent place .  
2	  I liked this memory card because it offers enough space for all of my high resolution pictures . Even that it is a SD " HC " ( High Capacity ) , it works smoothly in my camera and laptop , I wasn't require to purchase any special adapters .  
2	  I used this one on Nikon D60 SLR . My friend bought this one for his Panasonic point-n-shot camera and it works fine too . Pros : store 500 + photo when the setting was in RAW format , and 1K + photo when the setting was in fine format . Accessing time was good . Cons : Writing time was not as fast as Sandisk extreme II . But this one saved me lots of $ . Shipping was slow . My friend ordered his 1 day later than mine but received it 2 days earlier . Overall , this one is recommended .  
1	  The R15 came after the DirecTV with TiVo ( R10 ) . The R10 made DirecTV a clear winner ; the R15 has me thinking that cable or Dish Network might be a better choice . The user interface is OK , but is clumsy and clunky in comparison to TiVo . It has a few features that are pretty good , but instead of having their software people work on cool features , they should have had them working on making the R15 stable and reliable instead . At least a couple of times each month , I see it freeze , stop responding to the remote , lock up or restart itself . That 's not a complete list ; unfortunately there are too many malfunctions and performance problems for me to remember and itemize here . R15 problems are widespread : If you look at the tech support forums at DirecTV , a lot of different people in a lot of different places have had a lot of different complaints . It looks like a bug report database for software that 's not ready to go to production - yet they continue to push them out and hope that stacking " software update " band-aids on it will fix the deep flaws in the system software ( NDS has an unimpressive history and apparent lack of software dev talent ) . If you get an R15 , be prepared to 1 ) keep the details and paper together for the 30-day return policy , 2 ) be disappointed with the " downgrade " from TiVo , 3 ) use a power socket that 's easy to reach ( you 'll have to unplug it and plug it back in fairly often since it frequently locks up / freezes ) , and 4 ) adjust your expectation with the R15 's " normal " operation to give you picture glitches , change channels by itself , lose one of the two tuners ( comes back after you unplug / reboot ) , or any of another dozen malfunctions . Before getting stuck with one of these , definitely look at other DVR & service provider options , and consider the R15 as a last resort .  
2	  I have owned the Canon S500 for 7 + months now and taken over 1000 pictures . I must say that this is a highly capable camera in its class . It 's neither too tiny to handle nor big enough so as not to fit in a small pocket . It has more control than a simple point & shoot camera and gives consistently high results . The LCD though small is higher in resolution and it makes it look better than the bigger but grainier LCD 's on certain Sony models . Surely , small cameras like these are never comparable to professional ones but i would find it impractical to carry a big SLR everywhere ! Pictures taken carefully ( i.e. proper conditions and settings ) , are really capable of standing high among the results of much better cameras . Even though there are newer , sleeker cameras with better video capabilities , I reiterate that when it comes to still picture quality , the S500 is one of the most capable in its size and resolution category . Finally , you must always remember that a camera with ( x + 1 ) mega pixels does not necessarily offer superior quality than one with x mega pixels resolution .  
2	  The exilim series is a GOOD one from casio . It 's best feature is it 's weight and size IF that 's important to you - it is to me in this case . If you need more weight in a camera to feel comfortable , this may not be for you . The pix are as good as most cameras that size , the sexy black is a show stopper , but 10 pixels ? How much is too much ? You won't be disappointed with this camera .  
1	  I just received the camera as a gift and the battery doesn't work . I am advised to send the battery in to a service center along with a letter describing the problem and copy of the invoice . It will take about a month for the center to respond . This is an expensive product where you would expect good service but don't !  
2	  I got tired of using the " conventional " mouse . The Kensington Combo Trackball is easy to use . I knew that I would not have any problems maneurvaring the trackball ( and I don't ! )  
1	  I bought this for a recent snorkeling trip . The camera itself was leak-proof and performed well under water . The photos were quite disappointing though . It did not even come close to doing justice to what we actually saw . Not a very good buy  
1	  I ordered this assuming that it was new and would be in the original packaging . It was not in " Sandisk " packaging , but was instead in a generic plastic memory card case . I was afriad to put it in my computer since I had no idea what was on the card and was afraid that someone had tampered with it . After debating it over with my husband , he volunteered to put it in his computer since he wanted a new laptop anyway . ( It wasn't worth the trouble of a return but my husband was willing to take a gamble . ) His laptop read that the card was empty and we loaded pics on it and put it in a digital picture frame . We didn't have any trouble with it , but I 'm still disappointed with the way it was packaged . I would not have purchased this if I had known that it would not be in the original packaging .  
2	  The Corsair 16GB Flash Voyager in this reviewer 's opinion is all that you 'd need in a memory USB storage media device . Mine works exceptionally well and handles data transfer faster than I had thought it would . The rubberized casing is very sturdy . My only negative comment is the size .  
1	  The lack of any channel selection isn't worth the cheap price . I ended up having to buy another product to meet my needs .  
2	  This is the second one I 've purchased . I have had no problems with the first and expect the same for the second .  
2	  I recently purchased some other lenses for my Canon , and it didn't come with a cap , so this fited perfectly . I only took a star out because of the shipping cost . I ended up paying just as much for the shipping as I paid for the caps . If you can get them through Amazon super saver shipping it would be better .  
1	  The product does what it says .. it scans , organizes , and categorizes receipts from just about any retail store or restaurant chain . If you run your own small business and need to track expenses JUST via receipts , this is a great tool . Everything else about this product is broken . First , the program itself is huge . It installs MSSQL , and an a large set of programs and data files . It also adds a background service ( which autostarts at boot ) that eats 500M + of memory even when the main program isn't running . When it IS running , it 's combined system usage is over a gig of memory . Second is speed . The scanner itself scans receipts in quickly , taking only a second or two for a standard receipt , 5 or so for a letter sized page . The software then takes 30 to 90 seconds ( 2Ghz laptop w / 2G of ram here ) to " scanalyze " the receipt , depending on size and image quality . There is no way to batch scan receipts and put off the rest for later , so you 're stuck waiting for it if you have multiple receipts . If you 're lucky , it gleans and auto-enters data for 4 or 5 fields and / or auto crops and rotates your receipt . If not , you have to do that manually . It also claims to organize other documents . But other documents it means recipes and newspaper clippings , which are about all it knows how to do outside of receipts . It can scan and store letter sized documents and pictures , but it then spends lots of time trying to " scanalyze " it , even though it 's not a receipt , before finally giving up and letting you enter data manually . The interface is clunky at best , more so when you 're trying to scan multiple pages from a document in . And if the scanner get unplugged from the USB port ( which is very easy to do ) , you lose , as the software can not see the scanner again until you close it and re-open it , which takes at least a minute . Finally we get to export . The QIF data is great , but most recent Quicken products no long accept the QIF format . And if you happen to have an older version , you 're limited in what you can do with that data in any case . I 've also yet to get it to export a single PDF properly , so I can't say much about that except that it 's totally busted . And while I 'm sure the tax reports it makes are really nice , who 's going to use scanner software to print tax forms for filing ? Overall , the hardware is great , but the software is very lacking . It 's nice that they offer a twain driver in the bundle so you can use other software with the scanning wand . But even that interface is clunky , and only supports one image at a time scanning . So doing anything multipage is painful , and the buttons on the device are useless outside of the supplied software package . Again , it does what it says , but only that , and not that quickly . Also .. It doesn't work on Vista . Period . They 've released a few patches to try to update it , but they didn't work . And it now looks like they 've given up on the older version and are trying to get people to update to the newest line of software ( for a modest fee of course ) .  
2	  lo necesitaba mucho , a un amigoes de gran ayuda para pescadores aficionado , por eso lo compre , para disfrutarlo mucho .  
2	  I NEEDED A DRUM UNIT FOR MY FAX MACHINE AND FOUND IT ON AMAZON . COM AT A VERY GOOD PRICE .  
2	  Highly recomended . I suffered eye strain for a while . After careful research , I decided to buy this product . I can immediately tell the difference after I put this filter on the computer . The image becomes sharp and a little dark . No more eye strain even with a whole day in front of the computer . I 'm happy with the purchase .  
2	  I have been using the Microsoft wireless mouse for a few months and it is simply the best mouse I have ever used . It is very smooth and precise for my use ( I don't play any games ) . I like it so much that I purchased the Microsoft wireless notebook mouse for my Sony notebook . It is important to buy the proper mouse for a desktop or a notebook because the desktop has a fairly large receiver that plugs into the USB port , while the notebook has a small receiver that plugs into the USB port .  
2	  This is one of the best ipod dock I 've seen so far . Plays cds , dvds , mp3s , radio , and ipod music or video . Excellent sound and appearance . The muti features are great . I have to admit I was a little hesitant to purchase this items because of the reviews I read . But I took a chance and I 'm glad I did . The only set back to this product is that the volume defaults to 17 when you turn it on . And the display light is a little bright at night . One thing for sure you don't have to worry about a night light . There is no way I can see to dim the display light . Over all great product .  
2	  Super easy to use . Made applesauce , could not believe how easy to use when apples are fully cooked . Would recommend buying it .  
2	  Although I am an avid lover of Apple products , I must admit that these headphones are much better than any headphones made by Apple . Apple 's earbuds are painful . They hurt my ears because they don't fit well . I decided to give Apple 's in-ear headphones a try too , and was gravely disappointed . These V-MODA headphones are amazing ! The sound quality is great compared to Apple 's earbuds , and these come with not only three different sizes of earbuds , but also a thing to wrap the extra headphone cord around , which was exactly what I was looking for . These stay in my ear well when I work out and run too , which is an extra bonus . They also come in a variety of colors .. what could be better ?  
1	  My wife and I * really * loved this unit . It looks good , it was relatively easy to install , fit nicely under the dash and it was very easy to use . But we ended up sending it back . It seems to have an issue with heat . We live in Southern California and it seems that every two to three weeks or so , we 'd get the " white screen of death " : just a blank white screen , sometimes with an odd warning tone or sometimes completely without the tones you 'd normally get when it powers up . And when the ignition was turned off , the unit would stay illuminated and not power down as it should . The only solution to this ( after two calls to Parrot and another to Crutchfield ) seems to be to pull apart the dash and reseat all the connections on the main controller , as well as the cable connection on the back of the display . Kind of a pain in the you know what in my wife 's Honda . Add to that having to enter the security code on the radio ( I now have it memorized ! ) and reset all the stations ( those too ! ) . I 've now done it at least six times and I 'm tired . We considered getting a replacement unit , but we have read other reports of heat induced failures on the internet and didn't want to go through the replacement process only to have this keep happening . And I hear the 3200 suffers from similar problems . I also have to say that Parrot support is less than stellar . At one point I had to leave a message because no one was available and I waited for a call back for a week . I sent additional eMails with no response . I finally had to call them again and got an answer to my question . This is not the only lackluster experience I 've had with them . We had issues with another underperforming Parrot product as well and had about the same level of service . So , if you are considering buying this , think about where you live and if it * ever * gets hot - even in the summer . Or , for that matter , if the inside of your car ever gets really hot . You might end up going through what we did . I wish I could say otherwise , because this * seems * to have everything you could possibly want in an aftermarket hands-free device . But I can't . MF  
1	  I had my camera for nearly two years until .. the LCD screen went black . It worked great during those two years . I took it on tons of trips and got many compliments on the sharp quality of my photos . But it appears that Sony does not make cameras that are built to last , as many other people have had the black LCD screen problem with this camera . I spent nearly $ 300 on this camera and I was expecting to get at least five years of careful usage out of it . I would not recommend buying this camera , as nearly 90 % of the reviewers have had the same problem that I 've had . I 'm looking for a new camera and I WILL NOT be buying another Sony .  
2	  This skin fits the 30GB or newer small profile 60GB Zen Vision W. Won't be much use if you drop the unit , but works great to protect it from scratches . Improves the grip on the unit which I 've found a little slippery at times . If you want a nice inexpensive case for the Zen , most cases designed for the PSP work great .  
2	  They perfectly fit in the ear ( at least in mine ) . I use them for jogging - I like the over-the-head band that counteracts the pulls from the cables while you are running . The material as well as the overall construction seems to be solid and durable . Cable is long enough . Adjustable band over the head is firm and does not get loose . Sound is OK - I am using it in noisy places so I would leave this judgment for others . The volume control on the cable is a gadget - I personally do not use it but some people might . I used to have almost the same model before , but they suddenly stopped working ( yet , at this point , I should add that they had served me for a decent number of years ) . That is why I decided to buy another set close to the first one .  
2	  This is a great product . I bought mine in 2001 and still use it to this day on a daily basis ! There was a period of few years that I didn't use and when I graduated to wireless mice , but when I got frustrated with it , I found this and started using it . Its been 2 years continuously and I have no qualms with it . The bank button is use frequently but the forward button is hardly used because of the placement . The scroll wheel is much better than the new ones as it " clicks " and not lightly smooth scroll . The mouse is also ergonomic for my hands . Get this if you are on the fence . You won't regret it . Its not everyday you see technology item still selling since years ago . I also recommend the Microsoft Natural Keyboard with this mouse .  
2	  The best pot of coffee I have ever made . My son recommended this pot to me and I would definitely pass the recommendation forward .  
1	  These speakers sound very bad . Easy to install but not worth a penny , I will be junking these and buying something else .  
1	  I purchased this wireless mouse because it was less expensive than the mouse I really wanted ( the Microsoft mouse that works on glass ) . The mouse requires battery replacement all the time . I go through AA batteries at least once a month . This is excessive , compared to other wireless mouse products . Scroll will hesitate , and then while you are scrolling up a page , for no reason , it scrolls a little bit backwards and moves you back down the page . Then you have to scroll back up . It will do this for about the length of 4 or 5 sentences , so almost like a hesitation . It is annoying . I am a professional writer and can not stop during a critical project to address these concerns all the time . I 'm out the door today and going to buy a new mouse . I really do not like posting negative reviews , but under the circumstances you need to know . There is nothing more frustrating than working on a critical project late at night and then all of a sudden the mouse stops working due to the battery issue . The first time it happens you won't know to have batteries " on hand " and it will be a big disappointment . I hope if you do buy this product , that you go ahead and purchase a large pack of spare batteries . I would also like to mention that I have used all types of batteries . Expensive ones , cheap ones , etc . They make no difference , this mouse leaves you high and dry all the time , and always at the most inconvenient times . I can't understand why they pull so much juice from a battery . Kind of makes you wonder if this is made within electronic federal standards and if it is dangerous to be around the mouse for a long period of time .. This is an update .. 6 hours later .. I have purchased my new mouse . It is a Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000 White . Amazing .. the scroll feature is so smooth . Works like a charm , and on the packaging it says the battery will last approximately 10 months . Finally .. !  
1	  I bought this fully aware that the batteries cannot be replaced by the owner - you have to mail it to Palm , who for a mere $ 125 will replace it . But I figured the battery would last a long time . Wrong . It lasted four months , then died . I 'd say that is a fatal flaw . The competition lets you put in a new battery yourself , so I 'd recommend looking into some other product that lets you do that .  
2	  I purchased this printer about 2 months ago and I can't stop raving about it . I have it connected to my Windows 2000 machine here at home and am constantly printing out shots taken with my Canon G1 camera and people are always amazed to see the prints that I 'm able to make . Perhaps the only annoying thing about this printer is that if you want to make really sweet prints , you 'll have to sit down and look for the color profiles that can be found on the net . These profiles are for use under Adobe Photoshop and can sometimes really change the look of a shot to make it much more photo like in terms of color . Otherwise , I really can not complain about the quality of the prints . Great printer .  
1	  I am disappointed . I purchased the 2400 and got the greatest picture quality , indoors and out . Gave it away and purchased the 2600 . Photo quality is poor . It accidently turns on , I wish the smart card was placed somewhere else and not with the battery , the battery life is not that long . Only good feature is it 's size . Neat and compact . Wish I was able to purchase the 2nd 2400 .  
1	  A few years ago this would have been a perfectly acceptable AM / FM / MP3 player / recorder solution . Nowadays , the digital music / recorder market is flooded with competitors and this product is in danger of becoming obsolete . Compared to similar products on the market , the Radio Your Way LX has .. 1 ) Less battery life2 ) Less memory space3 ) Poorer interface4 ) More expensiveI was disappointed by this product and will be returning mine . I plan on purchasing the iRiver H10 20 GB MP3 Player / Recorder which is only slightly more expensive , but is also an excellent MP3 player . It can also handle the AM / FM radio recording-a feature that Radio Your Way previously had a monopoly on the market ( the iRiver documentation even says recording can be pre-set ) . Don't bother with the Radio Your Way LX .  
2	  This is my second stand . I now have one at home and one at work . It keeps the computer cool and at a good angle to protect my neck and back and also works well for my hands . I also use it to put my sewing machine on for the same reasons .  
1	  Unfortunatelly - and for my surprise - this item didn't worked for me . I was quite anxious about getting this item -I am based at Uruguay-South America and this kind of items are unusual here - but when I opened the package , connected to my laptop and tried to turned on using the switch - by the way , nice feature if it ever worked - nothing happened . Now I have a useless nice gizmo .  
2	  I just received my NIC yesterday , installed it today in my computer which did have Windows 98 but I replaced with Unbuntu 8.10 . The network card connected me to my cable network without my having to even download the drivers from the CD . Wow , that was easy !  
2	  This is a great printer , had it about 7 or 8 years , it is solid . I have " replaced " this printer a couple times when the ink runs out . You know , I see something else that has a built in scanner , memory card hook up , little LCD screens , but they are cheap and quit working fairly quickly , not to mention sucked up ink . The 960c seems to last 5 times as long ink wise . Text prints just as good as the new printers , and photo 's are about 80 % as good , but its cheaper and better to print photo 's at COSTCO anyway . This is a very good printer . If you can find a used one you should pick it up .  
2	  My receiver only has one optical input and I needed something that would let me hook up my Cable box , PlayStation 3 , and my computer . I found the Nyrius SW100 while searching though Amazon and it looked perfect for what I wanted . When it arrived I hooked everything up and it worked perfectly .. at first . I started noticing sound dropouts while watching the Cable box and assumed the new switch must have caused it . After much cable swapping and testing however , I found that the problem was actually in the output on the cable box . After getting the cable box replaced everything worked great . I 've had the SW100 for a month or so now and am very pleased with its performance . I haven't noticed any sound quality loss and have had no further troubles with sound dropouts . The only ' annoyance ' I really have is that I have to stand up and walk to the TV to turn the switch ; which , I admit , is more laziness on my part rather than a product defect . Perhaps some kind of remote switch could be added to a future model , but of course that would add yet another remote to the group I already have .. so perhaps not . Anyway , the SW100 is a great buy for the price and does exactly what it says it will do . I definitely recommend this product for people like me who need the extra optical inputs , but aren't quite ready to upgrade to a new receiver . * As a side-note , make sure you have an extra optical cable to run from the SW100 to your receiver along with the 3 that will go to your sources . I say this because I didn't even think about it and came up one cable short during my original hookup ; luckily I had an extra buried away .  
1	  Although NEVER mentioned in the product description , Garmin GPS units in this general category are NOT Mac compatible . They work ONLY with Windows . For such a well-known brand , this is surprising and extremely inconvenient . The ramifications of this are that the GPS works fine in the field , but waypoint transferring and mapping must be done on a PC platform . Don't have a PC ? You 're out of luck . Something I wish I had known before spending several hundred dollars on the receiver .  
1	  At first my music sounded horrible . I figured out that I needed to turn down the volume control on my iPod AND take the EQ setting off ( which I 'd set to " Bass Booster " ) . Having gotten past that , I enjoyed pretty decent ( but not great ) sound quality , only to have another problem crop up . My car 's tape deck began reversing direction automatically every few seconds , cutting off the music each time . Ugh ! .. I hope this is fixable ( haven't found the solution yet ) , but I sure could have used some clearer directions when I bought the adapter . So .. so far , I 'm finding this is not a carefree " plug & play " product . Hopefully , it 'll wind up being fully functional , though .

1	  A product is only worth something if it works - or if it is replaced promptly . Neither has happened with this product . It didn't work a bit when I got it , and I still haven't gotten a replacement as promised . Do yourself a favor - buy the apple cord and save yourself the aggravation .  
2	  I 'm adding this review because I was very nervous about buying this product because somebody had previously commented that they received absolutely no customer service from Cisco . I bought the product , and like other people , I couldn't figure it out . It was just over my head . You really do need to be a network engineer or very network savvy to configure this firewall . However , I called up Cisco Customer Service and they were incredible ! Seriously , I had to configure the firewall for a PBX server . I gave the Cisco customer service guy all of the requirements that the PBX company required , in terms of all of the port forwarding and configuration etc . , and the Cisco engineer literally logged into the firewall and configure the entire thing for me ! I was blown away . I thought I was going to have to hire somebody to do it , and he just did it for me . I 'm totally happy . Everything is working perfectly now . Pretty amazing in my opinion . I just called the regular tech support phone number on their website . If you need this powerful of a firewall and don't know what you 're doing , in my experience , Cisco will take care of you .  
2	  I was really in the market for a small lightwieght PC notebook . But as the only ones I could find below 2000 $ did not match my basic needs ( good grafics , linux compatible ) and I could not afford the top of the line 3500 $ notebooks . I decided to settle for a 12 " powerbook . Since I was visiting the US at the time of purchase I thought I would buy it from the Apple store and meet with my future companion first hand . At first I was rather mesmorised by how sexy it was .. But I thought that was just puppylove and that it would wear off after a while . So I scrutinsed the screen , the ports , the graphics and the drives . As the only other candidate that still would stand a chance agianst the 12 " PB specs was a slightly more expensive and physically larger Dell that I had never seen apart from a wonkey picture on thier website . I took the plunge . I invested my meager student allowance into the beast . At first I thought I would replace the OS with linux and that I would have alot of problems with a win2000 only GIS software that I have to use for school . But , now , 6 months down the line this amazing machine is still as sexy as ever . It runs my wonkey GIS software ( requires almost 3 reboots during installation ) through virtual PC much faster than my old PII400 . And I have yet to get around to putting linux on it as OSX just keeps blowing my mind . Everytime I want to do something , someone has already thought of that and implemented it as default in the OS . The only problem I have had is , after a month the computer failed to recognise the builtin bluetooth , even after re-installing OSX the problem persisted and none of the packaged diagnostic software could detect any probs . After a week without bluetooth I decided to go down to the local apple store and have them sort it out . But just as I picked up the PB of my desk my mobile connected to it . And as strange as it seems I have had no problems with bluetooth since , despite rigorouse testing . Overall this laptop gives the impression of being EXTREMLY well built . And I have yet to encounter any other laptop of this build quality ( having worked for advertising firms where a 7000 $ was the standard for running powerpoint presentations , with the justification that - we have to show our power through our superior laptops ) , this is in fact quiete a acheivment for any laptop , especially a sub 2000 $ one . The bluetooth failure had me worried for a while but the overall build of the laptop keeps screaming well built and as such I dont think about that problem anymore . I just keep throwing it into my bag , taking it with me to classes and seminars , guiding it throught the worst student town weather / storms without complaints . And to all you peze lovers out there , my beast comes to life in under 2s . I just open the lid and it wakes up offering to perform the most complex mathamatical functions . I havent had a virus since I got it . And the battery last for 5 hours without any hickups . I dont think you can beat this with any PC . If you dont think any of this is REALLY important , as I did before i went mac . I mean its not REALLY that important .. But to tell you the truth , it is .. Just try it , and you will find you probably can not live without it . To summerise my 12 " PB has suprised my in ways i did not expect it to , and has by far surpassed my expectations so far . And although i , out of principle , never award anything the top mark , I am happy to award something that keeps surprising me a 5/5 .  
1	  In an effort to save money I bought two of these . They look exactly like the real thing but they don't work like a real Canon battery . The batteries do work but it take some finessing . The one thing you loose is the battery strength meter on the camera . I may use these batteries in a pinch but you have no idea how long the battery will last . I wouldn't recommend these to anyone .  
1	  -I 'd rate this unit zero ( 0 ) stars if it was allowed ! I got this unit as gift for XMAS and have little experience with DVDs . Since XMAS almost all DVD titles exhibit some abnormality in playing about an one to 1.5 hours into the movie - either stuttering , freezing or lock-ups . With some DVDs the playback artifacts are minor and short-lived - with other DVDs once the player hiccups it keeps it up for the entire movie . And once the player locked-up and had to be powered off / on . Because of my inexperience I thought it was me , or the DVDs ; after reading these reviews and an analysis of the problem on anther website I 'm sure it 's the 740U unit ( which is really a .. 611 clone . ) It 's been very frustrating ! .. Thanks to all the people who entered their reviews into this forum , this has been a very frustrating and maddening experience . ( And , to Amazon . com for providing this forum . ) In closing , I know one electronics manufacturer who 's lost a customer . Most likely I 'll order my new DVD player from Amazon ! PS : I still haven't heard from .. , but I talked to the manager of the retailer I bought the Sharp unit from . I explained the problem , showed him the web info I had collected , and he took the 740U back for a store credit . I purchased one of the top rated units shown on Amazon .  
2	  I did have to call tech support to assist in the installation process , but it only took ten minutes to walk me through the process . I installed this on a dell for my father-in-law and it works great .  
2	  I 've been using this case to protect my sony computer for almost two years now . I love it . The only thing I 'd like different is if somehow it had a pouch for my charger . I understand that they sell one separately . I 've had a lot of people interested in the case and where I got it . The price was especially good .  
1	  This camera is a worthless p . o . s . if purchased refurbished . I cannot vouch for a new one , however ..  
2	  Bought this bag to replace one that disappeared from my luggage on a recent trip to the Cayman Islands . Bag , scissors , small digital camera .. In the bag when I left home ; not in the bag when I unpacked in the Caymans .. TSA traced it into the Airline System .. After that , who knows .. Contacted the airline , no response .. Life goes on .. The bag is bigger than the one I lost , it is substantial ; have used it for three rolls of film so far .. No problem . Would recommend to anyone who works with film cameras ..  
1	  Don't buy this or the Telephoto lens which attaches ( Olympus TCON-17F 1.7x Tele Conversion Lens for Olympus SP-310/350 Digital Cameras ) .. you will be wasting your $ on something that has very little affect overall on the enhanced telephoto abilities of a casual use camera .  
1	  This is a good camera when it works . Mine stopped working 98 days after purchasing it ( 8 days after the labor warranty expired ) . The parts were paid for , but I still had to pay .. labor charges to have it fixed . Customer support was absolutely NO help ! This will probably be the last SHARP product that I buy !  
2	  I won't even try to write a review of the camera to top some of the extremely helpful ones already here , but hopefully a helpful hint to " newbies " to dslr like me , and a comment regarding a very pleasing discovery . First , the hint - I bought this without a case / holster initially , but you really do need one to protect it . I found that the Lowepro Topload Zoom 1 works great for the K10D with its supplied kit lens . Although the camera / lens does fit into the Lowepro Topload Mini , it does so just barely , with no room for the strap . So if you 're looking for an inexpensive bag , the Topload Zoom 1 works great . ( I 'm putting this comment under the camera because I figured if you 're looking at the K10D , it 's best to report on a bag under the camera 's heading , than randomly under the bag itself , which would take a lot more work to find ! ) . My comment has to do with the Pentax 's battery . I 've been incredibly impressed by its ability to hold a charge . I bought the camera over a month ago - charged the battery when I got it , and it 's STILL , one month later , indicating a full charge , despite having been in the cold , and I 've taken about 300 pix ( about 1/2 w / flash ) ! I 'd worried about charge " shelf life " because I sometimes go for several weeks w / o using a camera , then , with my P & S , find the battery dead when I need it . This camera , after months of pre-purchase comparing , definitely offers the biggest , best bang for the buck ! You won't be disappointed !  
1	  After using it for quite some time , I decided that I wouldn't buy this CD player for $ 5 ! For your average music listener who can't tell the difference between good or bad sound , this is perfectly fine . For those who can , the sound is decent . Passable , but not great . I also found it a little flat . ( Not as in intonation . ) The button to open the CD player is pretty aggravating . You really have to push it down . Because of the odd angle at which the button is placed , you 'll have to put another finger on the CD player or else it 'll skid across the table . Because this has no skip protection , it 's really inconvenient . You have to glide across the floor to prevent it from skipping . Even a little nudge can cause it to skip . I 'd suggest doing some research and spending your money on something better .  
2	  This stereo packs a punch - it may not be big but it can sure make a BIG sound ! The bass and sound options are great - create your own effects according to style and customize to your desires . The remote is handy and easy to use . Radio gets great reception . Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a great stereo at a decent price - go ahead and rock the house !  
1	  By the way , I bought this at Walmart and I see on Amazon here that 's it 's not being marketed as a video player . On the official website and store packaging it is . Must not be a point to make on here , since it 's false . I wanted to affirm what some others said . It takes FOREVER to put music on it and I can't do it with their software , only through Windows Media Player . It must just not be very compatible with Vista . For a regular mp3 player , this item is very good . Graphically is cool and plays music fine . My main concern is the problem I went through in trying to get the thing to play video . First you have to install converter software to make your videos compatible with the player , which wasn't a problem with me . But I couldn't get the software to recognize the player . I sent an email to their support and was told to update the firmware . On the page for my item , the firmware update was a dead link , so I got another link and proceeded to download the update . As it was installing , it needed to connect with the device to finish the process but it couldn't detect the player once again . The also gave me a link to another update on firmware for a player that was not mine and therefor useless . On a second attempt to fix the problem , they emailed me and told me I would have to prove my item was bought within the last year with receipt and they would send me a replacement for the item with some ungodly shipping fee . Or , they informed me , I would have to buy a new one . I was upset by this because I didn't see my player as defective as it has never given me any trouble and the problem is they refuse to update their software . After their response , I have come to wonder if the thing ever was made to or able to play video in the first place or if that was some sort of trick marketing to get me to buy it . I 've never left a review on here before but the run-around they gave me prompted me to write .  
2	  Sony KDL-40V2500 40 " Bravia V-Series 1080p LCD HDTVI recieved the Item very promptly , It was easy to set up and has a very good picture , especially with HDTV reception .  
2	  Good long and solid cable . replaced an old frayed one . Made a big different , no more lock ups . Right angle helps in a smaller btx case .  
2	  Was better than I expected ! Turns a bit stiff , which may lead you to refocus picture after the filter is adjusted . But this really depends on your lens . Over all fantastic picture quality . I find that I have to photoshop alot less with this filter on .  
2	  I got the iPod about 3 months ago , and it has held up to the most important of my standards - it hasn't broken . I drop it on the sidewalk every few days , but it never even skips . I really appreciate the durability .  
1	  Purchased two of these - arrived quickly ; HOWEVER - after placing them both into 3 different new Lexmark printers , all 3 printers reported that the cartridges were EMPTY , and would not use them . Had no Lexmark markings on them ( Supposedly " remanufactured " , but apparently not correctly ) . Looked like a good deal on Amazon - claim to be " Lexmark cartridges " - but not worth the postage . DO NOT BUY THESE .  
1	  I can certainly tell this is a great way of purchasing MS points , its easy , its almost instant , and 24 hour open , but I found a flaw .. at least for me .. its US only , that 's frustrating for a lot of people like me that don't live in US that will have to wait for order process , delivery to an international courier , travel process from US state to non US country and then having to pick it up . Just to get a small card and put in a code .. really .. I can't see the reason why this is a US only , I buy almost weekly from Amazon , never had a problem , so why ?  
2	  I bought this router , ran it for a couple of days to make sure it worked okay , the reloaded it with the ( Linux based ) software from [ .. ] I now have more functionality and can adjust parameters such as the power level ( I increased the 28mw setting to 70mw ) .  
2	  I 'm surprised that this mount takes the abuse it does . I 've got it mounted on the dashboard of my power boat and I 've not had any problems with it so far . Once set properly it holds the gps in place at the correct angle . No problems with salt spray and the gps shifting out of position . Great little mount  
2	  Having fallen in love with everything but the price for some Bose headphones I tried at the ipod store - I began to look for some similar " over the ear " phones at a more reasonable price .. These are the ones I chose , and I love them - good sturdy phones at a great price .  
1	  Bought the Toshiba Regza 32 " HDTV in January of ' 08 and it worked just fine until yesterday when it suddenly lost its picture . Audio works fine and I can change channels , but no picture , just a blank screen . After reading the reviews here I guess I have joined the ranks of the poor souls who paid alot of money for a TV only to have it last less than 2 years . I liked this TV until yesterday . Toshiba can kiss my you know what .. I 'll never buy one of their products again . Unfortunately I have another Toshiba flat screen in the bedroom .. guess I 'll wait and see how long it lasts . I 'm buying a new TV tonight and I 'll see what can be done with the Toshiba .. maybe I 'll take it back to the store and leave it in front of their door . They can use it for a door stop . Buyers .. I would consider what we are saying here .. think about it .  
1	  I am compelled to write this review because this particular drive was simply plugged in for two months with one 20kB file on it while we waited to update our systems . This morning , I noticed the power light was orange and the drive smelled " hot " . I attempted to turn it off and , after the power button had no effect , I unplugged it . Upon repowering , the drive began clicking and groaning indicating a faulty drive . Truly unbelievable ! We 've decided to replace this " green " solution with an actual backup server PC which draws 400W . Thanks a lot , Maxtor .  
2	  Sometimes , when I 'm walking around and I see people with CD players , I just have to wonder how they manage . The most amazing thing about this device is the size . Not just the size of the iPod itself , which is a lot less than half the size of other MP3 players that hold the same amount , but the amount of space it saves you in terms of CDs . Have you ever seen one of those CD towers with around 60-70 CDs in them ? You know , the ones that are as tall as a bookshelf ? How would you like to carry that around in your backpack at school or in your pocket on the street ? I think carrying this thing around , which happens to be the size of a deck of cards and holds even more than those CD towers , is slightly preferrable . The next best thing about the iPod is the batteries . This thing goes for 8-10 hours without quitting . That is the same amount of time as a CD player , and twice as long as other multi-GB mp3 players . In addition to that , you never need to buy batteries again . Just plug the iPod into the wall at night and you 've got another 10 hours of music when you wake up . That 'll work even if you only sleep for 3 hours a night like me ! So this thing is saving both space and money ( batteries ) ! The third thing about this is how well it turns heads . Sometimes I try to hide this thing when I take it out , because strangers will literally come up to me and ask me " is that an iPod ? " and want to play with the buttons and stuff . Sometimes , it gets a little annoying . In these cases , the size comes in handy because its very easy to hide while you are using it . But if your in the mood to turn some heads , just put this thing on your lap and play . There are tons of other great things about this . The interface is beautiful .. sometimes , I just stare at the screen while a song is playing , or turn on the backlight for fun . It takes 10 minutes to fill the entire thing , meaning that if you ever get tired of the songs you put on it , you can have them replaced in the snap of a finger . But it all comes down to this ; when you buy this , you will never need another music player again . If you have a Mac , go buy this . The money you save on batteries and future music players will more than make up for the .. price tag .  
1	  Congratulations , Philips , you 've done it again .. you 've made a horrible drive and offer no support for it . The drive has burned only one DVD correctly in the months that I 've had it . It will only burn onto Philips DVD + RW and Philips DVD + R discs . If you buy this , don't waste your money buying non-Philips discs , they won't work . And then when something does go wrong with the drive , they shift you around the Philips support sites . If you 're going to spend this much on a burner , get an HP .  
2	  Although pricey , I am very happy with my purchase . I have a hardwired security at the front door . With this device , I am able to easily broadcast it so I can see the video on my Android phone . At first , I could only see the video through using the local IP address of the device , but found the reason I couldn't see it on the Internet ( even though setting up the proper port forwarding on my router ) was because I had not specified the correct IP address for the gateway . Now I can also see the view of the front door from any PC or any Android device . There is some other functionality available which I have not had time to investigate yet .. So it may be even better than I already think it is . In addition , I decided to go with the quad-view version for possible future expansion .. At the moment , I have only one hardwired camera . All my other security cameras are already IP cameras .  
1	  I am soo returning this piece of junk . Didn't even last a week of regular use . Cord is coming apart at the connectors .  
1	  I got my com switch hoping to finally be able to use my fax without a bunch of messing around . Not the case . The switch does not work as advertised . I spent hours trying different configurations with no luck . My business partner has the same switch and his works fine . The company no longer exists to support it . I don't know if my unit is defective or just a rip off . Dont waste your time and money like i did . I am out the ~ $ 250 I spent .  
1	  I bought a this and about a month later it just stopped working . I emailed digital media group and they sent me a Return authorization number which i put in an envelope as it said to do and repackaged the mp3 player and sent it back . 3 months later , i still hadn't gotten a replacement so i called them . They said that they had never gotten it but would send me a new one . The one they sent me wasn't a polaroid , but a generic brand one like it . The accesories were also generic name brand and pieces of junk . 2 months later it stoped working again and by then digital media group didn't exist any more . The headphones also broke and were very low quality to begin with . I learned my lesson about not buying name brand products nad just recently bought a video iPod which is much better !  
1	  I have had this fan for only a few months and the fan has already seized , making it useless . Dont waste your money .  
2	  I wanted a cheap pair of binoculars to just view things at the park , search for stars etc . The 7 x 50 binoculars are usually cited as being the ideal first pair . I agree with that notion , and these Vivitars are the ideal first pair also . I am not sure why they got such bad reviews from so many other people . Mine give a good , clear view and adjust easily . I can easily see nice detail in the terrain around me and a lot of stars . There is a nice feeling rubber casing around the binoculars . They are lightweight and easy to carry . The case is merely a soft cloth dustcover , the strap is nothing extra , and the eye covers are somewhat loose fitting . But hey , what can you expect in this price range ? I may get a " better " stronger pair of binoculars , but these are fine basic lower powered ones to just knock around with .  
1	  tinny sound - big mistake to have purchased it - invest in a couple of auxiliary speakers instead  
1	  when i get the hdd i installed in to a brand new mobo , install windows 7 ultimate 32 bits version . with the os installed , i turn on the system and get a blue screen of dead , the error code for the bsod was related to the hdd . once i was able to have the system up and running , i try to install office proffessional edition , but durind the installation process the system crash again . i 'm very dissapointed for this product , i have a seagate hdd i test that one on the same system and that one works just fine .  
1	  These cartridges arrived and I put the first one in my printer . It was empty . Light on printer kept flashing . Checked , rechecked nothing . Put the second one in the computer and that was fine . Two days later it was totally out of ink . Now I must tell you I am a 65 year old who uses her computer strictly to read emails and occasionally print them out , and to write " snail mail " letters when needed . I sometime print out crosswords . This is ridiculous . I asked for my money back or replacement cartridges . They told me that it was HP who sent them to the distributor and that there was nothing they were going to do for me . Very rude , and wow , Customer Service , I think not . The packaging appeared to be HP packaging , however , when I went to Staples to have them check these cartridges ( yes they confirmed they were empty ) and when I purchase another cartridge , I noticed that the packaging appeared different . The one I was sent was a very dull , matte type finish on the box . HP box I purchased was very glossy . So , I am out the price I paid purchasing thru Amazon and now I am out what I had to go spend at Staples . We are reporting this company . I don't blame Amazon , however , Amazon has not stood behind us at all on this . As I said we were totally taken for a ride on this and are out paying for products twice . We will not be using Amazon AGAIN .  
1	  Prints horizontal lines all over the page . Dots are uneven and visible . Compared to my brother 's same priced HP P1100 , it don't have any duplex printing , memory card or networking capability . Customer support is horrible , You 'll be atleast an hour on the phone before you hear a live voice .  
1	  I bought this for my daughter BD , she used it once on that day , and once more the next 3 weeks , only about 3 minute-used , suddenly the Flip stop working , thought it just batteries , changed fresh batt 's , but NO LUCK ! SHE WAS VERY VERY DISSAPOINTED ! NOT-RECOMMEND !  
1	  I was basically going for a stopgap here - something to play MP3 's on in my car until I get an iPod ( still waiting for that price to come down . ) The good : comes with 12V adaptor / cassette out ( car kit ) . Hasn't skipped at all in response to rough roads or light handling . The bad : Random play isn't random ! The same order will be played each time you choose random . And what 's worse , it won't remember what song you were on when you turned it off . You always start at the same place when you start up . Lastly , if the power adaptor pops out of the socket , which often happens on bumpy roads , the unit shuts off . These have combined for something of a miserable experience on long car rides - you 're in the middle of a 100-song mp-3 CD , hit a bump and the unit shuts off . When you plug it back in and turn it back on , you 're back at the beginning . You have to keep hitting the track skip to get back to where you were . Which could be 80 presses . And the player doesn't handle scratches and dust well at all . Just save up and buy that iPod . That 's what I 'll be doing .  
2	  Can't say enough good things about this computer . It took me about 5min to start using it from the time I got it out of the box . No software to set up - everything is done at the factory . Just plug it in and start using it . Even the packaging is amazing ! This computer interfaces like no other machine I worked with before . The OSX is a beautiful system - as stable as my new Porsche . The quality of the materials is second to none . Click on an application or connect your digital camera and this thing just works ! No questions asked . The speed is also amazing . No comparison to any windows-based machine I 've used at any price ! This machine is so superior . At this price , it is a bargain . Throw your PC away and get yourself one of these . You won't regret it .  
2	  I bought this quick release adapter to attach to my Slik SBH-320 ballhead . Compared to my experience with the quick release mechanism of my Manfrotto 141RC tripod head , I found the QRA-635 very unobstrusive . The very slim QR plate when attached to the camera never gets in the way when I stuff my camera in my bag , so the plate remains on my camera 24/7 . I like using it so much that I bought extra plates for my other cameras . The likewise slim design and light weight of the adapter itself makes it seem to be an integral part of my ballhead , that I usually forget it 's just an adapter . Mounting and unmounting the camera to the adapter is fast and simple . Once mounted , the camera ( a DSLR ) is held securely . This is one very admirable simple gadget .  
1	  I had this television for just over a year when the picture failed . The sound was fine , the channels changed , but there was no picture . ( After some research , I discovered that many people have had the same problem with Toshibas . ) The warranty period had just elapsed so I contacted Toshiba customer service to see what could be done . Not only were they rude and insulting but they indicated that failure of the television happened and said that that was just something that should be accepted with Toshibas . They suggested that I should have gotten an extended warranty . Repair of the television is approximately $ 600 . The television cost just over $ 800 new . Due to this experience , I can confidently say I will not be purchasing a new Toshiba again . Samsung and Sony definitely make a better , more reliable product , plus their customer service is much more professional , helpful , and courteous .  
1	  I bought a WRT54GS v4 wireless router on 10/30/2005 . It does not work by just following CD setup instructions . After talking to Linksys technique support , I manually configured the router in router configuration pages . The problem was both Verizon DSL modem router and Linksys router use the same default IP address . After got DSL working , I found that my PC is always talking to buydomains . com which slows down every command I entered for at least 20 seconds . I need block this URL in Linksys router . I did configuration , but the blocking URL does not work . The router can't block any URL by its name , nor by any keyword . Even disable HTTP service do not stop internet access . I spent three hours with the first level and his senior supports , updated the latest firmware and reconfigured Wireless router . But it still does not work . Then I was told that the hardware is defected and needs be replaced . I exchanged a new one from CircurtCity . But blocking URL does not work . After talking to three technicians and reached the 2nd level support , he admitted it was the problem of the the firmware because he experienced the some problem . I can either wait a newer firmware to fix this problem , or exchange to a old version of the hardware v3 . All WRT54GS routers at Circurtcity are v4 hardware . Two days later , I found the Secure Easy Setup does not work on this new router . After few hours talking to three technicians , reload the latest firmware , and did reconfigurations , I was told that it is hardware defect . I got the third router , but it is same as the first one . None of the Blocking URLs , nor disable HTTP service work . I can't do nothing , but waiting another updated firmware to fix those problems . I don't think Linksys QA missed testing . It is whole page of settings , and none of them works . Linksys technique supports also have many problems . The first level and their senior supports have no hardware to test . I was very disappointed by this product .  
2	  A really comfortable keyboard to use . Height / tilt can be adjusted so it doesn't remain flat on your desk . The keys feel solid and are very quiet . the wrist guard or support adds some dimension to it 's overall size but it 's removeable . The feature I find very useful is that it 's illuminated ( Red , Purple or Blue ) I prefer the Blue myself , and the intensity can be adjusted so it doesn't hurt your eyes working in a night time office setting . Try it out you will replace whatever you are currently using .  
1	  After using the JVC Video Head Cleaner , my vcr still did not work . I took the top off the unit , cleaned the heads with alcohol and BINGO , it now works .  
2	  Nikon D40x 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f / 3.5-5.6G ED II AF-S DX Zoom-Nikkor Lens  
2	  Typical of Amazon , the options for price , availability and delivery were great . I would definitely repeat this order for this , a perishable item . Delivery was actually better than expected .  
1	  I know from some of the other reviews that this mouse COULD be kinda ' exciting ' compared to an ancient ' ball mouse ' .. ( Does anyone even have one of those anymore ? ) But when it comes to our modern ' sensor-mice ' of today ? This thing is actually pretty so-so . ( though for a quick $ 19 buck fix .. propably ok . ) Like some others have stated , I 've noticed that the wheel and buttons are none-too precise . TOO ' sensitive ' when you wouldn't like them to be .. and alternatively not quite so responsive at other times . The buttons and wheel do routinely ' click / move ' themselves which can be a minor annoyance . On top of that .. the whole thing has a bit of a ' cheap flimsy ' feel to it .. and the wheel likewise has a very cheap clunky feel to it ( I kid not - It 's like a wheel on a cereal-box toy ) and broke down on mine after a few months . And as someone else mentioned ? The BIG RED light on the back ( the things ' snazziest feature ' ) is actually pretty annoying come movie time or likewise . ( I have to turn it around as well ) After having tried out this one Microsoft mouse ? .. I 'm actually perplexed why so many people think they 're so great . Seriously , the mouse that came with my old HP ( which I wouldn't have even thought much of at the time ) - spun wheels around this piece of junk .. and lasted a HELL OF A LOT longer ! Sorry , put the only impression I got from trying this one Microsoft mouse - was never to bother buying another one from them again . 2 stars for an barely-average sensor mouse at a minimal $ 20 bucks . That 's it .  
1	  Great item at a cheaper price than Nintendo would sell for and it works just as well .  
2	  My daughter needed a replacement for her old sony D-NE319 and this one works good with the old software as this was all loaded in the computer and set up how she wanted .  
1	  The Pioneer plasma TV engine is the best in the industry . But they stopped making TVs ( they license the technology ) over a year ago . Prices actually went up as the last units were sold . I was looking for the last model year 5020 , and when I searched Amazon this 5010 came up mixed in with 5020s . I did not notice the difference , and bought this prior-year model instead by mistake . It is fine for when it was made , but lacks many of the features , plus an inferior black level , compared to the 5020 . So don't buy this one , buy the 5020 if you can find any left .  
2	  It will entertain the kids in the back seat , and you can also take it into the hotel room to play back movies on the hotel TV . It plays DVDs , VCDs , and to my surprise , SVCDs . Super Video CDs are a higher quality VCD , burned onto a regular CD , that have near DVD quality . It comes with all the cables for hook up to a regular TV , as well as a 12V auto cord , wall charger / 110V adapter , earbuds , and the remote . Don't lose the remote . Without it you can't do anything except play and stop . BTW , you can make your own SVCDs from your digital camera home movies . You need NERO with the MPEG plug , a CD burner , and ordinary cheap CDRs .  
2	  I bought this lens for my Canan Rebel XT for my studio photo class , and it is great . Worth every penny . If you want a great lens for just walking around shooting or studio work , this is a great value . Some people were talking about the autofocus not working , I havent had that problem all photos come out crisp and clean . 5 stars .  
2	  Does what it says on the tin . Well made , easy to use , and ready to go out of the box . Clear instructions , and good battery life ( even from the included batteries . Used on a ' 95 Toyota Trueno-0 to 60 in less than 8 seconds-verified by K.A.T !  
2	  I have tried many , many different types of headphones and earphones and these are definitely one of the best I have come across . There are a couple of things I don't like about them though . First is the rubber padding around the buds , it makes it very difficult to fit into your ear . Using the earphones without the padding ( easy to slip off and back on ) seems more comfortable and the sound improves greatly when they are removed except that the bass is less prominent . Another thing I dislike is the durability . I have to replace them every few months . I usually have a problem with the cord wearing thin and eventually splitting and / or ripping . One of the main things I like about the earphones is the volume : it 's excellent , definitely the loudest I have used . Other things I like include the appearance and the length of the cord . Overall , excellent deal . About $ 5 for a good 3 or 4 months of great sound quality .  
2	  I really like this labeler . Its rechargable , has lots of features and it is capable of using a large variety of label types . I got a great price on this label maker and I 've been using it to label everything from servers and network switches to my personal drop files at home . If you need a very versital and reliable unit this should work well for just about anyone . I did have a DOA unit , the LCD screen didn't work and RMAing it through Brother was a pain in the butt and I just exchanged it with Amazon because the replacement process was so much easier . I suspect DOA on this unit is rare as some of our customers have this labeler at their locations and all of them work perfectly .  
2	  Received this lens about 1 hour ago , and , promptly started my testing , since there were so many focus issues , both with Amazon , and other web sites .. The first setting I made , after attaching the lens , was to set the focus to spot .. This was done to allay any miss-cues due to the very narrow focal plane at 1.4 .. I shot about 50 to 60 shots , both inside , flash and none , and outside on a bright sunny day - all at 1.4 and 2.0 f-stops .. As I take about half of my photos of flowers , I had been using spot focus for several months , due to many out-of-focus shots with auto focus .. With the Sigma 30mm 1.4 , I were nary a single front or back focus to be seen , only sharp photos .. Outside did require an 8000 shutter speed ad 1.4 though .. Had to make sure the lens was perfect , as I wanted to take advantage of Amazon 's 30 day return , and it is a Christmas present for myself .. ( will tell the wife later ) The soft focus I noticed at 1.4 and 2.0 were not overly apparent on my 25.5 inch monitor , had to really look for it .. This lens is as sharp , or sharper than the kit lens ( 28-135 EF-S ) that came with my Canon 60D , and I really did need the extra light for inside photos .. I would imagine this lens will be on my camera about 75 % of the time ..  
2	  After researching different brands of DVR ` s , I settled on this unit and now , after using it for a full month , am completely satisfied with it . Not owning a DVR before , I found this unit to be fairly easy to learn , and it provides ALL the features I need . I record my camcorder vhs tapes directly to the hard drive , and then " leap frog " them to a dvd , I also edit different scenes and am able to create the " perfect " home movie . I realy would recommend this product as I find the versatality of it truely amazing ..  
1	  About three weeks after I received it , I came home from work to the smell of burning plastic . I traced it to the powerstrip , which shot out sparks when I picked it up . I was able to quickly unplug it and return it to Amazon . Close call . It may have been the particular item , or perhaps the whole product line is faulty . I can't tell you that . But what I can tell you is that the particular item I received from Amazon almost started an electrical fire in my house .  
1	  I purchased this printer whiling running Windows XP and was very happy with its network functionality . Everything worked well and integrated with the OS . Upgraded many of my PC to vista and it all went away . Took months for HP to geta driver to get the printer portion of the machine to work over the network . 6 months later and still can't fax or scan over the network . Thankfully I have one XP system that is fully functional . So in short . Nice printer but if you are buying this printer to utilize the network capabilities and are running Vista or planning on running vista . Take a pass  
1	  no return policy , definitely an overpriced item and long mailing time . The item arrived intact and in excellent condition however .  
1	  is this an original version or not ? the cable works but the battery doesnt charge after just twice charging it .  
1	  I inserted the color cartridge into the printer and three weeks later I needed a new one . I was gone two of those three weeks on vacation and did not print anything in color the other week . Where did the ink go ? Just asking ..  
2	  The archos car lighter power adaptor works well , was received promptly , and was reasonably priced .  
1	  [ [ ASIN : B000PCBVA6 TomTom ONE XL 4.3-Inch Widescreen Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Maps of the U.S. and CanadaCame with old maps . Tried to download new ones , spent 2 hours on the phone twice . First time ended up with Guam only . Second time ended up with " no maps found " . Maybe its just me , but I would look at other GPS 's .  
1	  I tried this headset on my Panasonic DECT 6.0 portable phones and found that not only was it too quiet to hear the person on the other end but that I had to shout to be heard . I returned this product after attempting to test it on a few other phones with no improvement .  
1	  Three years later , it died . For the price , I guess it did its job . The switches on the headphone are completely USELESS . There is no sound difference ! It is a lie .  
1	  This unit is noisy , often doesn't burn complete CD 's at times , poor customer service when approached with the problems they gave me a check list which did nothing to change the outcome , and when I responded in kind they have not returned my calls or emails .. very poor customer service and products . I have been in Retail and customer service all my life and this is by far the weakest group of folks I have ever dealt with , uh make that they don't want to deal with legitimate issues . Tom  
2	  I haven't even used this stuff yet but I know it 's good wire . I have some of their 12 gauge wire and it 's excellent . This I 'll be using for surround runs , long runs . 50 ' runs . I 'd recommend dayton wire to anyone , it 's well worth the cost .  
1	  none of them fit in any of my ethernet ports ! , they are very tight and won't clip no matter how hard I push .  
1	  Attached new monitor with this cable . Picture was ' snowy ' . Got cable because is was not ' long ' . Attached longer cable , picture perfect . Forget about considering this cable .  
1	  Had this camera for just under a year , and encountered similar problems to other users . Now , I 'm no photogropher so while others comlained about its poor photo quality , with valid reason , that didn't bother me as badly since it was my first digital camera . However , the1 ) loss of a 100 + photos , 2 ) corruption of mem . cards , 3 ) sudden loss of power with difficult reboots4 ) horrible and gahstly battery life , and5 ) the now total loss of power with no reboots , Makes this a just an awful buy and total waste of money . Even for a first time simple user like me . This camera should be max $ 50 . Bottom line , PLEASE-DO NOT BUY !  
2	  Sleek , swift , highly functional and syncs seamlessly with Outlook . GREAT value , especially with the manufacturers rebate and considering it has a camera function .  
1	  This item was a gift for me . Though it is constructed well and supports the iPod Nano perfectly , it is not designed for any additional hardware . Being an avid runner , I have the Nike + sports package . The Receiver is NOT compatable with this style arm band ( neither is the FM receiver ) . iPod needs to design this arm band with additional holes ( aside from cutting my own into the armband ) for iPod accessory support .  
1	  I 'm a faithful fan of Marantz and have been using them for almost 15 years now for my home stereo equipment ( - speakers ) . The Marantz DV6500 Universal Player for years before upgrading to the newer DV 6001 one for the HDMI technology since I purchased the Marantz SR7002 THE Best Reciever they make . Or HIGHEST GRADE with THX , HDCD , DolbyTrue HD , SRS , and of course DTS among other features . The receiver sounds better than the last but the Player has drop outs when watching TV shows ! It was In the shop 3 times , so for weeks no player . They lost my replacement In the mail and took Into the eigth week to finally get a replacement . IN THE MEANTIME I WAS LUCKY TO ROB MY BEDROOM OF A SONY $ 99.99 player upconverter to use so for 8 weeks the Sony played perfectly . So It 's not my HDMI cable or any other trouble . It 's just not . But now the replacement player IS having DROP OUTS ! Now what do I do ? Yes when working It blows away any competition by far has a phenominal picture ABSOLUTELY AS GOOD AS THE SONY UPCONVERTER ! AND SOUND like you never thought It was going to be . NOTHING COMPARES ! BUT WHAT GOOD IS IT WITH DROP OUTS . Note Drop Outs never with music CD 's only DVD 's . IS THIS GOING TO BE THE START OF 3 MORE REPAIR TRIPS ? NOW THEY WANT TO SEE THE DISCS I 'M PLAYING ? IF I HAD ANY DOUBT IT MAY BE THE DISK don't think I tried that ? But I can tell them they won't get through 2 episodes without a drop out . Who knows If they got that kind of time . Or will they try tell me to go away this time ? 2 lemons unlikely . So I say a design flaw . Don't want to leave marantz maybe get the 5001 . But the store has to give me some kind of credit for mine . I will be going with lower priced models from now on ! As long as it has DTS It 's fine . I have the Marantz SR4002 receiver In my bedroom and It Is fantastic . With DTS . MY ADVICE STICK WITH THE DV 4001 or 3001 and save some money ! This Is a edit addition on 7/10/09I had to hook this up using an optical cable & a tri color cable for picture and sound , to get this to play with no drop outs . Now I have the Marantz SR4002 Receiver In my other room and a Marantz DV4001 for use with It . I 'm having more connection problems . The players remote will not work until warmed up 15 to 20 minutes . I had the PLAYER REPLACED and the new one does the same thing ! Marantz what 's up ? 2 Different Receivers and 2 different players ALL MARANTZ yet each set hasbig connection problems . Your own receivers are having trouble playing your players . Each time I tried a new player but the problems stay the same ? Never thought I 'd think of leaving . I 'd change players before receivers . In fact I hooked a Blu Ray up and that plays fine . Just the Marantz through Marantz has problems .  
1	  1 ) that in just a couple years , the battery wouldn't hold a charge and die in 45 min . and you can't change the battery2 ) the paperclip ( not supplied but don't leave home with out it ) Every owner now knows about the papercplip to reset and has one hid someplace . I gave it a rating of 2 because it held all the music i wanted , the shuffle play worked well , and was a nice music selection away from home . I now wish I had went main stream and spent the couple extra dollars and bought the Ipod at the first . i won't send mine to the landfill just yet , but as soon as it quits working on 110 , c'est la vie ..  
1	  Though the product does what it is supposed to , there are just too many FM channels wherever I travel and the quality is not good . It is now my expensive ipod charger in my car .  
1	  I need a good keyboard touchpad , this inferior product jumps the cursor around opening and closing windows , someone suggested repairing the crimped USB wires inside , I repaired the wires but the problem still exists . It seems Adesso products are too flawed for consumer use . I will never purchase Adesso again and recommend buyers to beware of this company 's inferior products . Adesso deserves 0 stars but I had to choose 1  
2	  This is my 4th apple computer , and the first apple desktop . All I can say is it is well worth the money . I bought it for my kids and also wanted to keep it in the living room , something that does not take too much space , and looks nice . I have to admit , I am using it to a fair degree too , and I like the software programs that come with it . Overall , I think it is money well spent .  
2	  I found this item pretty useful . It 's 2-step brightness helps . I even use this for reading purposes . Great buy .  
1	  Updated firmware on the PDA ( iPaq 3765 ) . Updated firmware on access point . Updated driver for WCF12 . Plenty of quality time with tech support . But in the end WCF12 is unreliable . WEP flat does not work . Never worked . Not even once . ( MAC filtering is alternative ) Cool when it works , but sooner or later it will [ have an error ] and require a hard reset ( = > re-install apps , data , drivers ) before it will work again . I am returning for PC card + new iPaq PC card sleeve . Hoping for better results .  
2	  This was my first portable GPS . The price was great for the features . The only issues I have found with this product is the satallite connection is slow at times in rural areas , and it is not compatiable with my cell phone . It would be nice to get directions to just a city without having to input an address .. it may be possible and I have not figured it out yet .. lolAll in all .. I am pleased !  
2	  Just picked up 6 packs of these QuickLock connectors for my home theater system . The connectors are very sturdily built and are actually a bit heavier than I expected . Audio quality has improved slightly due to the good compression on the speaker wires and the tight fit to the back of my speakers and receiver vs . hooking the components up directly with speaker wire . The connectors could be a bit cheaper , but it 's not really a big deal . You can find them cheaper on the internet , but I refuse to do business with some of those places ( RitzCamera , ANTOnline , etc . ) . Just read the reviews and you 'll know what I 'm talking about .  
1	  I found these to be very uncomfortable , and the fit is odd . They just feel wierd . Sound quality is decent , and for the price they 're okay . I would not buy again .  
2	  I purchased this camera for my son . He liked it immediately and found it far better than the Kodak one he had been using . It is easy to use and a good value for the money .  
2	  It is working fine even though we havent had an outage since installing the new one .  
2	  I just received theses in the mail . As stated in previous reviews the sound is awesome , Bass is great , mid range is great , and the high notes do not bust your ear drums out ; just try out the ear buds to see witch ones fit your ears the best . They stay in even when working out . I ride a stationary bike a lot and they do not fall out like the ones that came with my ipod . When I rotate back to the states I will try them riding outdoors , I am sure they will perform as stated previously as well . If they had an inline volume adjustment that would make these A-1 ; bottom line if you are tired of cheap sound and don't want to put up with ear buds falling out , when working out , these are the ones to buy . Well worth the money for quality that is backed up .  
1	  This fax machine is very unreliable . I used it mostly for sending faxes . Sometimes the faxes would go through without a problem . But more often then not , it would give me a " poor line condition " error message when trying to send multiple pages . So if I needed to fax mroe than one page , I would have to fax them literally one page at a time . This is frustrating and time consuming b / c then you have to dial for each page . I would not recommend this fax machine .  
2	  I wanted a home theater in a box but was nvervous about getting all the right features . This is a great buy because it has everything you need to be current - HDMI out - Fiber-optic audio in ( allows you to listen to TV in 5.1 surround , not just DVDs ) ( it also has RCA input in case your tv doesn't have optical .. i 'd note that if you have digi coax you can get a converter for that too ) . - Upconversion to HD for DVD's - EZ to set-up ( I got the whole thing wired in hardly any time , flipped the switch and * presto * I honestly wired the entire thing and turned it on and watched a movie without once opening the instruction manual . I will now read it though as i want to customize the surround sound further - though it really sounds amazing on the default settings . - The rear speakers can be used in almost any direction - you can sit them upright on a table and they actually look good . likewise they can be aimed forward , and / or stand-mounted-Came with plenty of speaker wire , nicely labeled , for getting the entire system running . i got all my wires hidden easily , given there was plenty of wire . - Even comes with an AM and FM antenna if you want to use the built-in radioRemote will be tricky to master - tons of features - but all in all the entire thing is intuitive . The sound is awesome - it totally changes watching movies and shows with real surround sound .. doors opening behind you , music coming from your right , etc . etc . The bass is fantastic . fills the room , plenty of thump for dramatic soundtracks and action / bomb sequences . For the money you can't beat this . Yes , part of me wants a component system , but i don't want anything too big .. all the component systems just take up too much room unless you have custom cabinetry .. and then you can't use the remote unless it 's all visible which means all the compenents would need to be showing .. whereas this thing takes up no space and packs a punch . to have such an awesome unit that is so compact is worth giving up on component system . visually , the dvd is awesome on my LC HDTV . i am constantly blown away . again , the sound is awesome , and tons of power out of the sub and speakers .  
2	  The case seems to be good quality . I use it to transport my laptop to and from work . No problems . Amazon sucks though ! So much for guaranteed Christmas delivery . They will guarantee it but when it falls through they blame someone else and won't do anything about it . How 's that for customer service ?  
2	  I 've run past my warrantee period for about two months now and the drive is still running . I was a bit bothered initially by too many people having problems . Maxtor obviously had a bad batch come out of the plant but mine wasn't one of the . Now that I trust the drive I can recommend it fully . As 500 gigabytes is still a pretty good capacity and the price has dropped , I 'll probably get this same drive . It has a solid and attractive case . The drive is almost silent , which is very important to me . It has both Firewire and USB connections . My old iBook needs Firewire for a bootable backup . My newer iMac needs USB . I partitioned the Maxtor so it can back up both of them . I have another drive the same size a Seagate that runs fine but looks decidedly cheap next to the Maxtor , which has a rubber or silicone coated metal enclosure . The case doesn't slide around , and doesn't need a cheesy clip on stand that won't stay attached . I switch drives every week between office and home so have two copies of everything . Maybe that 's why my drives don't break . They must know that one bad drive can't ruin my life . The Maxtor came both a USB and a Firewire cable . The Seagate only came with USB . The Maxtor cables were both 6 ft . long . The Seagate USB was 4 ft , not quite long enough to reach from my iMac to the shelf I want to put the backup drive on . The Maxtor cable ended up at the office replacing the shorter one . The Seagate works but when I get my next drive I 'll look to another brand . Another nice touch is the one touch backup . Install the software . Set the options and I could back up by just pushing the button on the front of the drive . It 's a nice extra . If I didn't already have a solution I like , that alone , would have recommended the Maxtor over its competitors .  
2	  I honestly had doubts , especially after reading the negative reviews . I ordered 4 for the heck of it .. only 6 bucks with shipping , no problem . So I then plugged one into my Xbox 360 , the other into my receiver and so far .. WOW ! The quality of the cables are amazing and heavy-duty . Thanks Amazon !  
1	  This product is not worth it . While you are able to transfer files , it only allows you to pretty much only do that . Cannot use ActiveSync .  
1	  I have bought 3 pairs of these headphones , with no pair last more than 3 months of use . Here are my issues I have had : pair one : cord stopped working in the headphonespair two : the connector seperated from the cord itselfpair three : the subwoofer does not work after one month of use , and now the musicsounds truly crappyI had a pair of Skulcandy headphones that were collapsable that I bought in 2007 and they worked exceptionally well until my dog ate the cord in 2010 . Little did I know that it was the beginning of the end . Amazon has great customer service , but because I cannot return them now due to the time frame , I went to the Skullcandy website . I clicked on support and it took me to a google search page ! I clicked on customer care / help or whichever is on the bottom of the page and it took me to a google search page ! Now I am frustrated and have no options and have to look for a new pair . I just want my old heaphones back , or at least a pair that will last more than three months .  
2	  $ 14.99 for this ? ! ? ! Are you kidding me ? Yeah , it 's no BOSE , put it 's the BOMB . XM , FM and CD for this price is unbelievable . I can't think of a better investment than this for Christmas . I bought this and the XTR3 for myself and I am SO impressed that I want to buy one for each of my family back home . Please note though that you don't need to buy the 3 way bundle that is offered , I paid ( or perhaps wasted ) an additional $ 13 plus shipping for the antenna . The boom box comes with an one and so does the XTR3 unit . Seriously , I have been rockin ' out to Sirius the past two days and LOVE it . Xact haters be damned .  
2	  This is exactly what I needed for my mid 2000 's BMW that had a 3.5mm audio input but not an ipod input . Works great as do most Belkin products I have used . Thanks Belkin !  
2	  I bought this for my son who worked as a journalist intern this summer for a small town newspaper . He was taking a lot of his own photos and needed a camera bag that was something he could use for his slr camera but also like a briefcase . This bag was perfect . Most camera bags are either for the professional and over kill or too smallHe loves this and it was a fantastic value ! Shipping cam quick too .  
2	  My Desktop is only a 140 GB drive , so this 320 GB machine sounded great for the price . Once again , as an illiterate geek , I was disappointed to find NO instructions except how to plug it in . When I did get the main window to open , I used " SETUP " to install the software . But this is no simple ' drag and drop ' situation . It also comes with two ( 1 month with option to buy ) programs called Memeo Synch and Memeo Backup . This just made it all the more confusing . At the present time I have download about 19 GB of information , but it took literally more than 24 hours . I expected to just install and walk away with everything installed in less than 3-4 hours . If you are familiar with computer backup systems , you 'll probably love this , but if I can't figure it out in the next few days , I 'm taking it back .  
2	  dont call NETGEAR for tech support , its over - priced and not worth it , instead , look it up on thier forums and instructions for help on install . trust someone who has been thru this .  
2	  This cable for as cheap as it was works just as good as a 150 Doller cable . picture and sound are great .  
1	  I have tried two wireless routers to date with my IBM Thinkpad w / Centrino wireless . My first , the Linksys BEFW11S4 , never sustained a connection for longer than 30 seconds before dropping the connection , then re-establishing , then dropping , etc . Impossible to download large files , get booted off IM constantly , and took forever for simple websites to open . Linksys technical support even tried to dump me off to IBM technical support , but I just didn't buy it , considering my wireless connections have been fine elsewhere . I have also seen many websites offering this suggestion and that , tweaking the connection software , upgrading firmware , blah blah blah , but honestly , how hard does it have to be to get my wireless network up and running . The D-Link DI-614 + has since worked like a charm . Easy to setup . No dropped connections . Seems like it works fine with my Centrino .  
1	  The price looked right , but as others have mentioned this receiver has :* a poor layout for inputs , * a terrible manual , * a difficult remote , Sony is coasting on their name with this one . In addition , after a period of full , normal operation the unit began to go into " Protect " mode .. there was little information available ( not in the manual ) , so I began troubleshooting , as recommended in some online forums , by removing all connections - and found that the unit still entered " Protect " mode with nothing else ( components , speakers , etc . ) connected .. power on .. protect mode . Very frustrating to have no information from Sony . This " Protect " issue taken with the other afforementioned and unrelated design and documentation faults led me to return the unit and go in a different direction . I spent a little more and purchased a Pioneer VSX-1015TXK ; I have been much happier with the Pioneer unit . I also considered the Harman Kardon AVR 240 , but this Pioneer has proved to be a winner . I recommend you stay away from Sony until they get it right .  
2	  I wasnt sure if it would work because I have a 2002 and the package saie from 95-01 was pleased that it fit and instalsation was easy satified with the parts . My friend even asked me to order one for his truck .  
2	  My new camcorder works as fine as expected and delivers everything I need : high-quality video , easy-to-use functions , compact design with incredible size and weight , 3 " LCD color display , editing software ( Pixela Image Mixer with VCD ) .. However , one drawback : the quality of still images recorded on the provided memory card ( 8 MB MMC ) is lower than I expected . But that 's not a problem : I have a Canon PowerShot digital camera for this . To sum it up : If you want to use this camcorder as a digital still camera : don't buy it . If you want to make great videos : BUY IT . Thanks Amazon for the fast shipping & delivery ( even with Free Super Saver Shipping ) . ( .. ) A satisfied customer from France  
1	  It only worked good for about one day , And then I couldn't get it to turn on .. so I had to unscrew it and take out the batteries and put them back in and then it turned back on , which I find completely ridiculous . I read the other reveiws and I guess I just got a dull one . * Sigh * It seems like everytime I buy a camera , It breaks the next day .. I feel like crying , I guess you pay for what you get , huh ?  
1	  What they don't tell you is that to make this work in any appreciable way without having to pull cables , crawl under your house , dig through drywall or otherwise destroy your house , you have to pay extra for a special wireless connector . Otherwise all the money you 've spent for this widget is useless . Well , I 've bought this Slingbox back in February , and it still sits in the box , unconnected . I can't make this thing work with the home network , no matter what . I 've called customer support any number of times and gotten almost no help . This product is a gigantic waste of money .  
1	  Upon the recommendation of a co-worker , I purchased the Etymotic ER6i earphones about a year ago . Initially , I was very pleased , as the sound quality was superb and the earphones where really comfortable to wear , even for an extended period of time . However , after several months of use , the right earphone stopped working all-together and a few months after that , the left earphone started to break in and out . For a product priced as this , one would expect better reliability than several months of use before it stops working properly . Not to mention , the expensive filters that seem to require constant replacement / cleaning . Overall , I would say that I am rather dissatisfied with this purchase and will be looking at cheaper alternatives in the future .  
1	  I purchased this DVD player in Dec of 2006 . The machine sets up easily and the picture is great , when it plays the DVD . I have come across 2 new releases that this machine would not play . I contacted Phillips and all they could say was that the machine would not play the new " dual-layer " discs and no firmware upgrade would be offered . My asceessment seems to be that this machine was manufactured a couple of years ago and they are no longer offering any supports or updates .  
1	  Within a year of buying this TV , it started to have problems turning on . I would click for 4 - 6 minutes and then it might turn on with no sound at all or at full volume ( which wakes up everyone in the house ) . Sometimes when turned on all you see is a stripe pattern or a " tye-dyed " effect . Lines of pink squares also appear . The TV has to be turned on and off several times before it corrects itself and is watchable at all . It has been highly annoying . We paid quite a bit for this TV and bought it as an anniversary present to each other when my husband got back from serving in Afghanistan and it has been nothing but a headache . Do yourself a favor and buy a different brand / model .  
2	  This is my 3rd Canon camera , 2nd Elph . I am the epitome of an amateur photographer , and my attempts with prosumer cameras have all failed . At the end of the day , I need a simple point and shoot that produces high-quality images that are capable of being enlarged to 16x20 photographs . The SD800 meets all of the criteria and more . The SD800 excels in low-light environments , producing stunningly clear photos indoors . The 7MP images coupled with the 3.8x zoom provide a great baseline to Photoshopping and online manipulation . My only criticism is that outdoor images can tend to over saturate the Blues and indoor images over saturate the Yellows , but overall the image quality is excellent . The camera is amazingly small , and travels well . The flash is powerful .  
1	  I am usually pleased with Amazon products but not with this one . My cassette recorder needed cleaning so I purchased two cleaners . Neither one worked . This one arrived and the tape was crinckled and very dry . Even adding the liquid did not help . The tape could have been old and dried out I guess . All I know is it wasn't usable . Defective .  
2	  I 've owned a HipZip for about a month now and am extremely pleased with it . I bought it because 96MB of memory in my Rio500 was not enough anymore and additional 64MB memory cards were too expensive . For a bit more than a new memory card , I got a HipZip plus 80MB of memory on PocketZip disks . A pack of 10 more disks ( 400MB of memory ) runs around ( $ ) on the web . The first thing to note about the HipZip is that it 's both a portable MP3 player AND a portable USB PocketZip drive . Not only can you download and play MP3 , WMA , and ( promised ) Audible formats , but you can move any type of file from PC to PC with it . That 's a bonus . The best things about the HipZip are : 1 ) Sound quality is stunning through the right headphones . The sound through studio quality Sony headphones is just phenomenal . I didn't know MP3 could sound this good . It 's not near-CD quality , it 's CD quality at 128 KB / s encoding rate . Wow , I didn't expect this . 2 ) Cheap 40MB media ( $-$ ) hold 40-80 min of music depending on whether you use MP3 or WMA format . 3 ) 12 hour battery life 4 ) Doesn't skip . I can jog with it . 5 ) Durable . I 've dropped it several times and it still works . The case pads the player . 6 ) Player shows up in Windows as just another disk drive . Files can be moved , added , and deleted FAST using Windows Explorer . USB transfers are just seconds per song . ) 7 ) The player seamlessly plays MP3 and WMA format files in any order on the disk . 8) Dadio operating system is extremely stable for a first generation product . One crash in a month . I reset the player once with a paper clip . 9 ) Great display . Backlit . Song titles scroll by making it easy to find songs and skip around . 10 ) Free case .. and it 's a good one . I never take it off . You can operate the player right through a clear window on the front of the case . 11 ) Musicmatch jukebox is bundled with it . That 's another ( $ ) you don't have to spend . HipZip is integrated as a " send to " device right from Musicmatch . 12 ) It 's plenty loud with the right headphones . 13 ) Firmware upgrade at .. was really slick . Wait .. there must be something wrong with it . Nothing does everything right , so here are the reasons not to buy this . 1 ) The tiny earbud headphones that come with the player don't do justice to the sound . I threw the headphones away and use the best sounding headphones leftover from years of walkmans . 2 ) The battery is not replaceable . It 's Li-Ion which means it holds a 12 hour charge and will probably last for years , but it bothers some people that they cannot replace it . I expect that the players are going to be cheap enough in 1-2 years that buying a new player will be a better deal than replacing the battery . 3 ) I had to read the " manual " to understand some of the finer points of using this . Gasp ! This unit is for people comfortable with computers , RIOs , Nomads , etc . The disk adds one more layer of complexity over a flash-based player . My HipZip started skipping and Iomega customer support said the disk was probably bad . They were right . I read the " manual , " and learned how to reformat the disk and everything is fine now . 4 ) The current firmware version does not play Audible files and it doesn't have " bookmarks " so you can start up where you left off . This makes it a bit clumsy for listening to audiobooks . I 'm waiting for Audible compliance , which I hope will add bookmark capability also . 5 ) Check .. for other complaints . 6 ) Do not buy one if you are a parent and have kids or teenagers in the house . They will each want one and you will have figure out how to come up with ( $ ) for a HipZip for each kid . That 's my biggest problem right now .  
1	  Actually , it 's more of a hum . Volume is OK and radio reception is fair but just turning it on your stuck with this annoying hum so you really can't enjoy music if you play with the volume low .  
2	  I know this amp doesn't push that much power or anything but I love it . I just sold my old sub which was a dual 2 ohm kicker L5 12 " , which I ran 450RMS to and the amp never even got warm . It slapped really nice for just being 450 watts . I have a kicker cvx ( dual 4 ohm ! ) coming right now so that I 'll be able to push 650 RMS to it .. Can't wait . Love this amp . Such a good product for the price .  
1	  The picture is great . However , the volume on this TV even at the maximum setting of 50 , is not loud enough . If you are going to buy this , be prepared to purchase an external set of speakers . I 've just returned the TV to the seller . If it is for a small room such as a bedroom , it may be OK , but not for a den or living room .  
1	  This product did not even come close to my expectations . It 's actually not good at all . I tried contacting the company for help ; got no answer . I tried to contact the company to be able to return ; got no response . I am EXTREMELY unhappy with this product & service - or lack thereof .  
1	  Was away on vacation and forgot my charger for Sansa Clip ( Sansa Clip to Computer ) . Ordered this charger and had it express shipped to my location just to discover that I needed my original charger to utilize . Amazon rarely disappoints , but this information NEEDS to be included in the description of this charger for Sansa Clip users . Not sure if this charger is good / bad or useful at all - right now I couldn't care less as I 've wasted two days waiting for its arrival and after receipt , I 'm on my way to Best Buy to purchase an original charger to use . Sorry Amazon - this time you fell short . Need for original charger is clearly indicated on package - again , this needs to be spelled out in description of product for purchaser .  
1	  I bought these headphones for the " enhanced bass " but was dissapointed . I 'm not an audiophile or musician . I just want a pair of headphones that don't skimp on bass . I prefer the more fleshed-out sound heavier bass provides . Unfortunately I found these headphones to be the exact opposite ! The sound was thin and brassy . ( I only use them hooked up to my stereo . ) Compared to the Sennheisers I 've owned , these Audio Technica ATH-D40fs were downright nasal sounding . I wonder if I got a dud pair . I get the feeling Audio Technica 's are aimed more at the professional musician crowd who are able to discern sound better than me , and are pickier about a " truer " sound . Admittedly , the level of bass I want seems to be described by others as muddy or boomy or inaccurate . So while others are happy with these headphones , I 'm not . I guess I want mud lol . If you want bass check out the Sennheiser EH-250 . I just bought a pair and I 'm in pig heaven again , bass-wise . I can also recommend the Sennheiser HD-457 , though they 're not as comfy to wear as the EH-250 . BTW , the Audio Technica 's come with a 1/4 " plug so you may need a 1/4 " to 1/8 " stereo ( not mono ) adapter .  
2	  These are a good deal if youre looking for speakers around 100 dollars . The only real problem is that you have usually have to crank the bass up to 10 and have the bass boost on for it to sound really good . This can be a problem if you live in an apartment and dont want to bug the person in the next room . The cds with the fine production jobs sound loud and clear but the ones with the worse production sound muddy and you have to turn the volume up to 5 . Thats why Im thinking of buying newer more expensive speakers so I can get clearer bass and treble no matter what the production is like but these are a great deal if youre looking for speakers in the 100 dollar range .  
1	  First , the hardware . The Linksys WUSB54G wi-fi adapter comes in the form of a small box with a flip-up antenna . You hook the included USB cable ( A-B type ) to the adapter and to a USB port on your PC - high-speed USB 2 port preferred - and you can surf the web wirelessly . The adapter seems average in performance , in terms of speed and distance . ( I use it with a Linksys Wireless-G router . ) The signal strength seems to fluctuate quite wildly , even when you don't change any of the factors that might affect it . But overall , it works . Now comes a BIG warning : do NOT install the utility that came with the adapter . It has a confirmed serious memory leak problem . By this I mean that after running the utility ( which sits in the system tray ) for about an hour , it 'll have gobbled up anywhere between 300MB and 600MB ( or more ) of your system memory ! My desktop has 1GB and at one point the utility took over more than 580MB before I shut it down via the Task Manager . Unfortunately ( as another example of really bad software engineering ) , you can't quit the program for real . As long as you have the adapter active , the utility will come back to life and start eating up your memory again . If you have Windows XP , use the OS 's built-in " Windows Zero Configuration Wireless Client . " First , uninstall the Linksys utility if you already installed it . Second , you need to install the adapter 's driver : simply plug the adapter into a USB port , and , when Windows ' driver search dialog comes up , browse to the " Driver " folder on the Linksys CD-ROM ( e.g. , " D :\ driver " ) , and use the " v4 " ( version 4 ) driver , which is the latest - after that , Windows ' built-in wi-fi client will automatically kick in . Unfortunately , if you use Win2k or earlier , you 'll have to either live with the poorly written Linksys utility ( the problem exists on all systems ) and restart your PC periodically to reclaim the memory , or just return the whole thing as a defective product and get another adapter ( e.g. , Netgear ) .  
2	  I was very satisfied of how easy it was to put the new battery in my IPod , although it was not easy to open the IPod to get the old one out . It is nice how much money I saved buying on Amazon . com than if I had went to the Apple Store .  
1	  I own another camera just like it . The seller sent me a damaged camera and has refused to refund the cost . I would never buy anything form her again .  
1	  I have been using Memorex DVDs for the past year or so and up to a month ago had burned around 600 Memorex DVDs with , maybe , one or two coasters . I couldn't understand why everyone was down on them . Then last month I got a bad batch and about halfway down a 100 stack started getting a lot of bad ones ; I was up to around ten when I gave up using them and trashed what was left . I had seen lots of people here recommend Taiyo Yuden / JVC as the gold standard of DVDs with most people claiming they never had a bad disc . The 100 disc stack I ordered arrived this afternoon and I started right in burning . The first disc was fine , the second one looked like it had water stains on the burning side so I didn't use it , the third one generated an error message after around twenty minutes : Can not record on this disc . Now I have to decide whether to keep going or just pack them up now and return them to the seller . I guess I 'll keep going ; maybe one bad one isn't the end of the world , but coming up as only the second disc burned it isn't a great omen . Then again , maybe I 'll go back to Memorex . And I have to say , too , that I don't like the idea of there being no printing , no name on the disc ; for me , it 's damn hard to tell one side from the other .  
2	  If you are looking to buy LaserJet 1300 ( or its cheaper sibling , 1150 ) , take a look at newly released LaserJet 1160 and 1320 . They address some of 1150 and 1300 's biggest shortcomings while being nicer looking . I have used LaserJet 1300 for several months and while I think it is a decent printer , I am not a fan of protruding paper tray ( it reminds me of old DeskJet printers ) and its output bin tends to curl papers when 50 or so pages are stacked . After playing with both 1160 and 1320 , I got 1160 ( refer to my LaserJet 1160 Amazon review ) . Both 1160 and 1320 look more like a laser printer while still maintaining small footprint . LED status lights are still cryptic , but they are now clearly labeled . Although multifunction input tray can accept only 1 sheet at a time ( 1150 and 1300 accepted 10 sheets ) , the paper handling is improved overall and output bin is more robust . And output quality is crispier , with better defined text and graphics .  
2	  This one is really a very good camrea , maybe the flagship model in the compact digital camera range of Canon , it makes good pics , it has a pic / image stabelizer , lovely design , 4X zoom like most canons compared to 3X zoon in competetive cameras , and it has many more nice features that were mentioned in previous reviews butt .. the but is not a small one in this case , and these are the kinds of buts that diffrenciate between a good camera and a great one , it is one of the best but not the best , surely not the greatest camera in its segment : 1 ) almost no manual posibilities , you cant " grow " with this camera if you start liking / enjoying photography and want to expand your skills . 2 ) i find the digic II processor thats fitted to most of the canon models nowdays rather limited , although it gives great images , it like its sibelings has many limits and it seems over the hill compared to some of its competetors and the processors they have fitted in thier premium cameras , i have to say that this is one of the main reasons i feel somtimes that canon cameras are overrated . 3 ) the price , this is the biggest problem of this model , its way to high and does not justify the extra 25 % till 40 % percent you pay for other cameras in its premium segment , further more other cameras in its segment offer a larger varity of technical , manual and tecnological features for even two thirds of this cameras price . 4 ) there is also an issue with the mic when filming video , as several reviewers have mentioned . Canon has produced a very good camrea , solved many problems of its predeseccors , dont see this review as a negetive one ! its easy to say whats good about it and honestly it has lots of things going for it and whoever buys it will surely enjoy it , its one of the top 5 camreas in its segment , that means one of the top 5 compact digital cameras out there today , but i can think easily of two , three camreas that do it for less and do it better .  
1	  I bought these speakers about a year ago , and they worked SUPER well until I packed them up to move . From the point that I unpacked them they made a consistent ( and loud ) crackling noise that really effects the sound of the music . Not only that , but now I am unable to make the speakers go any louder than low volume . These started out well , but with a little stress on them they completely crapped out .  
2	  The new apple keyboards have black keys and clear plastic .. cool look and the usual functionality .  
1	  I installed this product on my golf cart to protect my radio . After one week of use the closing tab broke off and the sheild no longer stays closed .  
2	  .. I must say that I am thoroughly impressed with the sound clarity of the Koss Portapros ! I am an avid audiophile on a college student budget , and after wearing down the cable on my Shure E2Cs I was planning on making a Shure upgrade . However , after seeing all the stellar reviews of the sound and build quality of the Portapros , I had to see what the hype is all about . These headphones have drawn me into listening to my entire music library all over again . The highs and mids are just as clean as the bass hits , not muddled at all . I 've been hearing minor audible details in my library that I 've never appreciated before , and have made old songs new favorites for me . The comfort of the Portapros is .. well , comfortable ! I realize its not a fair comparison , earbud vs headphone , but I have been able to listen to my Portapros indefinitely , time permitting , with no discomfort , as opposed to the few hours I could stand with my Shure E2Cs . The cable is also very sturdy feeling , and long enough for walking around with an mp3 player in your pocket / sitting at a PC listening to music and working / or sitting a few feet away from a guitar amp and jamming out with the included adapter . And for a fraction of the price of my considered upgrade , I couldn't be happier . Also , for those concerned about the 80s retro look , it 's pretty subtle , but I happen to like the look to be quite honest . Thank you Koss for putting out such a great product , unchanged , for so long !  
1	  I bought a set of these headphones for my teenage daughter . The headset that came with some foreign language software had fallen apart and these were a replacement . After only 4 weeks - she was putting them on her head and one of the ear pieces just snapped apart ! The wires were still intact , but they are basically not usable anymore . She really liked the sound and the noise cancelling features on them - it 's too bad they just didn't last long enough to make the purchase worthwhile .  
2	  I got this DVD Player for Father 's Day and I really wasn't sure if I wanted it . My wife encouraged me to hook it up and it turns out it is much easier to use than a VCR . We have watched five different movies and I can't imagine going back to video cassettes . It also plays CDs which I wasn't aware of before . The buttons on the remote are a little small but other than that it is very easy to use .  
2	  I bought this device in hopes that it would emulate as a serial port and work with Cisco Rollover Cables . It works ! I can hyperterminal as COM8 or COM9 and make changes on various Cisco switches . Used it all day at work and did not have a problem . I don't believe in using the CD media provided . I downloaded from the website and did not have one problem installing drivers . I have also read that it works for OS X to do Cisco work . So happy it works . I wish laptops still had Serial Ports installed on them .  
1	  I expected better sound quality . I expected simple and easy . The sound quality is okay . I rate it fair . Simple and easy . It is simple to put the ipod in the docking station and it is easy to insert the cord into the ipod . However , the picture does not show this little cord that goes into the top of the ipod . Makes one think that you just sit the ipod in the docking station and it is done . The volume control doesn't work well . I have to turn up th volume on the ipod , then turn the volume up on the docking station . Its okay . I use it in my bedroom . Its not that attractive and it plays songs . I would not recommend it and I will not buy another one .  
1	  These are by far the worst headphones I 've ever had . Indeed , I promptly shipped them back to amazon . What I find most surprising is the lack of quality coming from Philips , which is generally a quality brand . The sound quality is anything but . Weak and devoid of timbre , it 's a shame they 're on the market . As for the noise canceling feature , it 's non-existence . If presenting the listener with a faint but consistent low-pitched squeal in attempt to mask outside sound is Philips ' idea of noise-canceling , then I suppose it 's effective . Although I may be an audiophile and demand high quality from companies who deem themselves serious contenders in the world of sound , I 've had cheap WalMart phones better than these .  
2	  It 's exactly what is advertised and works perfectly with myManfrotto 725B Digi Tripod with Integrated Ball Head with Dove Tail Plate and Carrying Bag ( Black ) . I keep the plate that came with the tripod on my Digital SLR camera and I keep the extra one I bought on my camcorder .  
2	  Everything is what I want . If anything to improve , it can only be charged with car charger or USB connected to laptop . I would like to have a stand alone charger so that I can enter some addresses without turning on my computer .  
2	  This stuff safely cleans , without leaving streaks , on the aforementioned electronics I 've used it on . Even when my toddler smudged my laptop 's screen with maple syrup hands , the large marking came out without issue ( although I wouldn't recommend testing this ! ) . The product comes in a 9 oz container ( for me it should last years given the amount needed for each job ) and a re-usable cloth . I would not hesitate to buy again .  
1	  Yes this is an amazing toy , it 's pretty , the picture is perfect if you 're using the HDMI output , everything about this is good . Great size , clean look , it 's all great . Then it stops working . And believe you me , it WILL stop working . It 's a problem with the firmware . Sony is aware of the issue . They are still selling the defective units . They are doing this why ? To charge you to fix the old one ! THE NERVE ! Sony has gone the way of so many companies . They have lost all my trust , and I 'll go out of my way to buy a different companys products if it 's feasible . * UPDATE * To explain what I mean by " It WILL stop working " and " It 's a firmware issue " This unit has a neat feature . You pop in a movie .. we 'll say you 're watching The Shawshank Redemption . Halfway through the movie your buddy / parents / wife whatever comes in and wants to watch something else . So you eject , pop the new movie in . It finishes , and they go away . At this point , you can watch 50 more movies , or go right back to Shawshank , it won't matter when you do it , but Shawshank is going to play from where you left off last . That 's pretty neat . Now imagine watching ALOT of movies , and always ejecting them after the " movie " is over , but not the credits . Each of those will start at the credits until you finally get to the end . The DvD player stores each of those movies positions until they are played through . After a certain amount say .. 200-250 movies stored like that , the player gets full . It 's at THIS point that the player stops working . Period , it doesn't know what to do with the stored data , and can't add more , so it won't play at all . That 's the issue in a nut shell . If you buy this player , make sure you ALWAYS let the DvD run until it pops back to the main menu , or eventually you 're in this situation .  
2	  It is very good ! I always use sony headphone . this brand is really nice ! fit with my ears and so comfortable !  
2	  I am satisfaced with this memory card .. I recommend it . Its Faster and secure ..  
2	  I 've had this camcorder for a while know , and i have to say that for the prize excelent FOR ME . Know the Sony TRV-140 isnt all flowers , it does have some but few flaws . 1 . Steady Shot isnt superb . 2 . REC button some times gets stuck and it wont retract after you press it like it should , but dont worry because i fixed that with just a little bit of grase . Well know let me tell you , the things that you will appreciate from the Sony TRV-140.1 . USB Streaming . 2 . DVin / out port3 . Super NightSHot  
2	  There are some really long write ups , so I will keep mine short and sweet . I bought this to back up my iTunes and iPhotos via firewire . Since my older Mac doesn't support USB 2.0 firewire was a must . If I backed up my music and photos via USB 1.0 it would take over 24 hours . I have owned this over a year . It has been reliable . It does heat up and makes some high speed spinning sounds at times , but nothing too unusual . You should be able to buy with confidence . So far , so good .  
1	  I had a 60 gig Maxtor drive that failed after about a year in use ( 25 days after the warranty expired and Maxtor would not replace it . ) Because of low price and other good reviews , I replaced it with this 120 gig Maxtor drive . It failed in 2 days . No more Maxtors for me . A Quantum drive was in this machine for 2 years - no problems . I replaced it because I needed a bigger drive . I am suprised more people don't complain of quality problems with Maxtors . I am now looking for a Quantum or Seagate to replace the Maxtor .  
1	  .. but it slowly faded ! It made terrible sounds and broke quickly . I have had many turntables and they all worked well . For some it may work but I reccomend researching this buy further ! ( unless you can afford it )  
1	  Even though the recording was packed securely in the box , when I used it for the first time the entire front came loose . Since I need the recorder for academic purposes , I could not send it back then wait for another one . Also , there was only one in stock . This time I got had !  
1	  The downlowding is very slow because it is USB . It gets frozen a lot ( I press restart an average of 2 times a day ) . There are only folders for in the Hard Drive Part Not The MP3 . The Case it comes with is bad . The only good thing is the price .  
1	  These earphones were a dissappointment . I did my research on earphones and read that these earphones would be a great replacement for the ones that come with the iPod . I found they lacked bass and mids . I only heard the highs . I liked the fact they had earbuds that fit snugly in your ear . This was supposed to help block out all the surrounding noise , giving you a cleaner experience . The iPod earphones sounded better . Who knows they may have been defective for all I know , either way I wouldn't buy them again .  
1	  I installed it but it never worked as a USB 2.0 , only works as older , slower USB .  
2	  These cds came strangely packaged , but they came promptly without damage . You can see the packaging in the picture . I will be ordering from this company again .  
1	  Got this for a Christmas present . Plugged it into my Dell Inspiron laptop and it lit up , detected and I was able to plug a keyboard and mouse in and then blamo it died . No light no nothing . Tried on several other computers and the thing is dead . Lasted a whole 8 seconds . Very cheap - get what you pay for I guess . I would advise to stay clear .  
2	  When it comes to function and value , I don't think I have ever found any product as good as this one . Case closed .  
1	  I once rated the fingerprint reader very highly .. when I was running IE6 . Now , with Internet Explorer 7 it plainly does not work . It will crash the app every time . MS sent out an updated driver that fixed the problem only on IE6 , so until they decide to fix the problem , I 'm stuck with a glowing red paperweight . Another issue that I have is that it doesn't work with other browsers . Another way MS can monopolize the market . On the mouse end , it 's definately a good product . Accurate and quick . The ONLY change I would make is some sort of low battery indicator . When the batteries run out , it just stops working without warning . As of this review , there are no drivers that will allow the reader to work with IE7 .  
1	  I purchased this for my mother in law who could not hear the phone ring . The ringer does have a volume control as well as a slider on the side to adjust the tone but it is just not that loud . About as loud as a regular telephone ! I was looking for loud and just did not get it !  
2	  This product is exactly what it says it is , and is great quality for the price . Unfortunately , I do not know a lot about sound system wiring and I purchased this by the advice of a friend who was an " expert " on sound equipment . He said that shielded wiring is for the most part a scam and that it was completely unnecessary for wiring speakers at our church - just a way for the companies to charge more money . Because I listened , I basically have an awesome antenna in the attic of my church . There is a lot of interference . If you need just plain speaker wires buy this , it 's fantastic ! If you need to pull through walls and ceilings for hidden wiring , buy something shielded . You 'll be glad you did .  
2	  " The case is better than expected . Many cases offered provided protection for the DVD player , but this case went one step further and provided pockets for DVD media ( a cut down sun visor CD holder works good in the center pocket along with the remote ) , the DVD player pocket is well padded with velcro straps to hold the player secure and ear phones work good in the outer pocket . The case has an adjustable shoulder strap as well as a case handle . Excellent choice for anyone ! "  
1	  I could never get the Vista driver to install properly . The one on the CD didn't work , the one on their website didn't either . The Realtek driver that installed itself automatically made my machine unstable . I called tech support and the lady hardly paid attention to my problem , and instead read from an annoying script as is what appears now standard for outsourced tech support . On the other side , even though Trendnet doesn't support Linux , it was plug and play and worked as expected in Fedora 9 . So the open source Linux guys * without pay * made a better driver than Trendnet " engineers " ? Unbelievable , I don't think I 'd ever buy another Trendnet product . So if you 're planning on using it in Vista , steer clear . However for other OSes it may work . Since I bought it to use in a Vista box , this one goes back to the store .  
1	  I received this monitor as a christmas gift and after using it for a few weeks it does not work any more . Their is a smell which I believe indicates something internally has fried . Their is no manufacturers warranty and no where to send it to and amazon is not helpful at all . It 's a piece of garbage .  
2	  I was using these at Christmas last year when my brother-in-law tried them to listen to something . He is one of those " must have the best of everything " type of guy . After listening to the song , he asked about the headphones saying " these are really great quality , they must have cost a bundle " . I replied that you can get them for $ 5 to $ 15 ( depending on if you want the in-line volume control ) . The quality really is topnotch - even more so when you consider the low price . I go through headphones very quickly ( tend to pull the wires out ) and I get ear infections from the earbuds . These never cause infections and never make my ears sore like other brands . I can wear them with my glasses with no problems either . I don't seem to go through them as quickly as other styles ( that have the two ears attached ) , but I do go through them - but at this price , I don't mind buying a set every three to four months .  
2	  Great little DVD player and the price was great ! It works fine and no complaints .  
2	  I have the old ipod charger with me , sadly it broke easily when i had the ipod charging with it and the connector to the ipod broke , so i had to get a new one , quick . Basically i baught this , and i do not regret it , it works very well and it auctully does charge my 6th gen Ipod Classic very well . The shipment was in only 4 days and was quick . It seemed to good to be true , but in this case it is .  
2	  Cheap Lightweight Headphones That Sound Great . I order a pair for work and another for use on my Xoom tablet computer . Much easier to use the tablet ( for games , music etc . ) in a noisly location when you have headphones . Small easy to store in tablet case .  
2	  Nice fit . Comfortable to wear , tho after about a few hrs it does seem to pinch the ear . Not the Best headphones but for the price you will not be disappointed .  
1	  I had ordered this product to drown out the sounds of outside while listening to music . It did not do this . There was nothing in its discription that would have told me , this ahead of ordering .  
1	  Camera , mic , drivers , and software all worked fine . The clip will not hold properly on the rather wide edge of the Thinkpad T-series laptop . This caused the unit to constantly slip around and fall off . This is somewhat surprising from Logitech considering popularity of T-series laptops . Logitech Support acknowledged repeated emails but did not offer any solution or resolution .  
1	  This item seemed to heat up fairly hot when I used it . I backed everything up to it , it comes with pretty good software . I hooked it up to a usb hub so I can control all these things at once . last night it began sticking and then started buzzing every five seconds . If you dont beleive me search on your google free agent buzzing . It seemed like it was incurable so I took it back . Seagate and Maxtor have always been run of the mill brands , I always trust western digital a bit more . DOnt know why . I got a mybook home . It is cool and easier to see when its working or not . Power button is clearly defined , unline the seagate . The seagat is also going to be top heavy on that wierd base it has . So You will have to place it in an area were it wont tip over . I lost interest and looked to western digital . The software they both use is the same one , so you wont have any issues going from one to another . Also Seagate had a bunch of uneeded software , the western digital had just what you needed , nothing more and nothing less . I liked that . The western digital world edition i passed up because people said it sounded like a rocket ship . The western digital home one doesnt sound like its on at all , its easy to see when the drive is working and I dig on that ! Good luck , if you get stuck with the seagate problem , I told ya so ! Jason  
1	  I loved this cord for as long as it worked . It broke in about a month . The little plastic tab for holding it into my computer snapped off , even with the little rubber thing that is supposed to protect it . It didn't get snagged or used roughly either , just every day use while my computer was on my desk . :( Unhappy with this product and now I have to go buy a new one !  
2	  my friend just bought these to replace the factory speakers in his 1997 f150 the only thing that we had problems with was screwing them in , they now have some pretty awkward angles because of the screws but they work great an were definitely needed to replace the stock ones which had absolutely no foam which is to be expected from 14 year old speakers  
1	  If you run the battery down . The battery low indicator will stay on until you delete all the files from it . I have deleted the " setting file " and that helped but not all the time . It makes the setting file when you change settings ( like random order songs ) . I updated the firmware and it still the same problem . The radio and sound quality is very good . It does last for a day on 1 battery .  
2	  Man , what a hell of a product . Been looking around awhile and came across this . Had it for a month and loved it . Installation was easy , even though I was aware of some battery placement problems , set up in 5 minutes . MAKE SURE YOU CHARGE THE BATTERY ONCE YOU GET IT OUT OF THE BOX . My flat screen was above my fireplace and the Comcast Box ( Go online to see where the IR sensor is located ) sat on the mantle and made it look to junky up there . This solved my problems by hiding the Cable Box behind the TV to make for a smooth looking TV mount . Love it lots and man does it have power . Bought another one I was so impressed for my stereo in my closet .  
1	  I bought this drive about 5 months ago . Just this week it stop recognizing original CDs and CD-rs . When I try to burn a CDr in Nero , Nero spits it out and says insert a blank CD . Tried every different brand , updated the firmware , and finally called Sony to RMA the drive . I spent over 2 hours on the phones with techs who have gone over every single thing I 've already done before giving me an RMA number . It 's been a nightmare and I wouldn't buy another Sony product because of the poor quality and bad service .  
1	  More than half of these CD jewel boxes were broken . It did not appear to have happened in shipping ( although they were packed haphazardly , at best ) . They were all shrink wrapped together and appear to have been broken before they were shipped . Unfortunately , they were meant to be divided up and hold CD gift certificates , so I didn't discover the damage until a couple days before Christmas , when I removed the shrink wrap and a shower of plastic pieces fell out . Breakage included the inserts as well as the boxes . Too late to return them , so I used those I could , but they sure were NOT the bargain they had seemed to be .  
2	  I was looking primarily for the wireless phones with tolerable sound quality that can provide my midnight guitar practice through signal processor with greater freedom . With corded phones , I sometimes ended up breaking the phones ( by standing up not realizing I am on leash ) or the guitar ( tangled by the cord .. ) . I 've been researching for a long time . I tried Pioneer one ( which I ended up keeping ) , XDream whatever , Amphony .. If you are considering wireless cans for the same purpose , listen up . Infrared ones provide relatively good sound quality , but mostly suffer from " latency " or audio lag . With it present a little , you may be able to watch TV or listen to music , you never can play guitar through it . Amphony gave relatively good qualtiy and low-latency , even if it uses digital technology , involving signal sampling / conversions , which most likely results in audio latency . I used 2.4GHz version but couldn't stand the popping noise . The new 5.8GHz one might be better but kind of pricey . Sennheiser RS140 is , in my opinion , a masterpiece in this regard . Cheap ( considering quality ) and absoluately no latency , due to analog transfer . I could even walk in the house , room-to-room , w / o interruption of audio ( just a little " analog " noise , which is more tolerable than digital one ) . The sound quality is actually better than Pioneer 's 5.1-capable phones , IMHO . I highly recommend this product to the ones having the same purpose as mine as well as to anyone looking for good-quality wireless phones .  
1	  I purchased a lumix digital camera together with this Trascend 8GB SHDC class 6 flash memory card TS8GSDHC6E . My daughter ( Marcela Jimenez ) was in New Jersey , where the product was delivered , today , she came back , and she let me know that she only received the camera , and not the memory card . Can you deliver it to the address that I gave you , since my brother in law lives there . Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS10 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD ( Blue ) Sold by : Amazon . com LLCAvailable Actions  
2	  I use this in my home office and it works great . I had a Samsung before this one and it lasted 3 years . For this price , this printer is a steal .  
2	  Have had it for months and have ordered 2 more . Does as It should .  
1	  I ueed these screen protectors on both my digital camera screens and on my 2 GPS units and my cell phones . The problem is they all have air bubbles under them . I tryed to work them out with the supplied squegie and by re-installing them but a few air pockets remain . It makes the screen look bad .  
1	  I just ordered these and got them in the mail and tryed them out . While I was jogging they would just not stay over my ears they kept falling off . They seem like they should be used for just walking use . I guess they work better with people with larger ears . I tryed using the ajustments that came with it and it still didn't fix the problem . So take it from me buy something better you would be alot happier .  
2	  Nothing wrong with the product . Comes with a lifetime warranty from Kingston , but I really doubt you 'll need to use it . Very good deal , but I would suggest buying 2gb micro SD cards instead of buying multiple 1gb ones ; you pay a bit more , but it 's a lot more convenient .  
1	  Followed the instructions ( extremely small print-had to use a magnifying glass to read ) . All indications are that it has a full charge , but won't run the laptop for more than a few minutes .  
2	  I thought about buying ( and have had ) other UV filters , but I never want to regret that the once in a lifetime photo could have been better with the proper lens filter . I chose the B + W and have no regrets . Besides , just about everything Germany makes is of the highest quality !  
2	  This is one very fast hard drive - MASSIVE over 750 GB has a 16mb cache and 7200 RPM - comes with a 5 year warranty - what more could you ask for ?

1	  Purchased two separate units , both of which have failed in exactly the same way as detailed in the CNET discussion forms . Works for a few months , and then one day * poof * your data is no longer accessible . It 's not a coincidence - it 's a crappy , flawed product which is eventually going to have a class actions suit filed ( as evidenced by the Sklar lawfirm 's website and numerous discussion boards ) .  
2	  It 's price is 419 buck in Canon website . and in here Amazone says the last price 670 bucks and now 386 bucks . when we compare the price we notice that we can save only 14 bucks from canon website price . Are you kidding me Amazon . com ? However the lens is great . I love it too much .  
1	  Don't order from 1800EMART . They will not send you what you order . They will send you a cheap generic charger that doesn't even look close to this one . When you contact them they just tell you to use it and let them know if it works . Well I better get paid to be a tester , not have to buy their product and risk my own to test it . The one star is for 1800EMART not the described product .  
1	  Bought this frame on sale , lasted about 1 year .. Viewing angle really is horrible , you have to stand right in front of it to see the pics . It does have a nice split screen / random showing of pictures .. not worth the money .. shop around .  
2	  it is worth a few extra bucks to get the Moose over other polarizers ; I like the slight warmth it lends , particularly to digital prints , which can be too blue in my mind .  
2	  These are great . I love the sound quality . They fit wonderfully ( 3 sets of fittings for good in-ear seal ) and are very comfortable . These are by far the most comfortable earphones I have ever had before . With my music playing on my Ipod nano 3g , I don't hear anything else . It is wonderful ! V-Moda 's description is right on the money . I recommend these to anyone interested in a good , COMFORTABLE set of earphones that you don't have to pay a fortune to enjoy . I also like the little silicon cord wrapper that came with them .  
1	  I have been buying HP products since 1995 ; I bought through these years 4 printers , one Laptop and one desktop HP . So I thought that HP was a serious brand about quality , it is not the same with the cameras : - The flash takes 30 second to be ready ( that 's a lot of time ) - The camera just take pictures when it thinks that the picture is good , it does not matter what you see on the screen , the camera has the final decision about the picture ( very different than other cameras in the market ) . - The pictures are grainy ; you can't have a moon or a sunset picture without grain . - You have to wait almost 5 seconds since you hit the shoot button and when the picture is taken , you can't take a picture of an object in movement . But that is ok if you are looking for a cheap-bad camera , and the quality of your pictures is not an issue for you , like I was . But after one month and 14 days the screen went black with strange colours ( of course the HP warranty cover this problem for just 3/4 of the price of the camera ) . I think the screen is not important anymore because anyway the camera take the final decision as HP .  
2	  The WorkCentre has an excelent ADF . Although the price is a little bit high , it did worth ! . Congratulations to Xerox .  
2	  I got my Zune as a late Christmas present and I was on the fence after reading the negative reviews about it . Let me tell you , do NOT buy into the negativity . I 've read the horror stories about botched installs and I didn't have any issues of the sort . I just popped in the CD and BAM , I was off and running ! I can only surmise that the people who had trouble installing haven't updated their systems . It says on the bottom of the box " Windows XP SP2 , or later " . I really like the big screen and the music quality is top-notch . As for those who want to use it as an extra hard-drive , well it 's a music / video player , NOT an alternative hard-drive . I tried out the Zune marketplace and I found it very intuitive and EASY . It 's a great player and it 's a great start for Microsoft in the music player department . I gave it 4 stars out of 5 because it has to convert some of my videos to go onto the player . Besides , nothing 's perfect . ^ _ ^  
2	  Philips is going to hate me for writing this , but I have found TiVo to be useful even though I am not a subscriber to their service . I hesitated to buy this for a while becuase I thought either a small monthly charge or a large one-time payment went with the cost of the recorder . I read in the documentation that the recorder would have " limited capability " without the subscription to the service , but that amount of capability was really what I was looking for , so I don't plan to EVER subscribe to their service . Without subscribing , I can pause live TV , do an " instant replay " of it , and record by time and channel . TiVo is more convenient for doing these operations than a VCR because I don't have to fool with tapes and cue them up to find the beginning of a show . Because TiVo is digital , the video quality is better than a tape . On the highest quality setting I have the same level of digital quality of my satellite dish . The thing that I 've found the most useful is that I can watch a recorded show while making a recording of another , which a VCR can't do . I realize that some people like the features that come with the TiVo subscription . If people choose to pay for those things , that 's their choice . I can't use the TiVo guide to look through the listings and select by name a program to be recorded . TiVo doesn't make suggestions for me based on the shows I 've previously selected , and it doesn't automatically record my favorite shows if the time changes . But I know which shows I want to record every day , and DirecTv has a good guide that I can search through to find other shows to record . When I come home in the evening , I still have good shows to spend my limited TV time on , and I still have the money that I would have spent on the service .  
1	  I 've had a tough time with my unit , which was delivered just days ago . Set-up was simple enough , but the first time I tried to send a fax , the paper jammed BEHIND and wrapped around a roller . I tried everything to pull it out , called HP tech support , etc . I ended up with lots of small pieces of torn paper , sore fingers , and no progress . The machine is designed in such a way that a simple paper jam can require a technician to take things apart ! HP , I expected better !  
2	  With only a few caveats , I like these earphones very much . I listen mostly to classical music , and it sounds more clear and natural with these earphones than with any others I own ( Sony and Sennheiser ) . I tried my sister-in-law 's Bose noise cancelling headphones and liked them , but I think I like these much more . They block out sound better than the Bose headphones did , and the bass is more natural . I like that these are smaller - they 're much more portable . These earphones are ideal for orchestral and vocal music . I hear every instrument , every note . I also hear every defect in my source material and am now in the process of re-recording music to my iPod with less compression . I don't like them quite as much for organ music . The bass is beautiful , but it lacks the visceral element of the bass produced by my regular sound system . I studied organ at UT on a large pipe organ , and I liked the way deep bass passages made my rib cage resonate . No headphones can reproduce that effect . There are a few things I don't like about these earphones . I 'm getting used to having them in my ear canals , but I still find the sensation a little unpleasant . I have to make chewing and yawning motions when I insert them to get my ear canals lined up properly to accept them . But this is getting better , and I think that it will soon cease to be an issue . I agree with reviewers who can't easily tell which phone is left and which is right , but as it happens , I don't really mind switching left and right . If I did , I 'd probably mark one phone with a dot of nail polish . I think the list price is excessive , but the Amazon price was quite reasonable for the product . I don't understand the reviewer who said that the Etymotic earphones stick out of his ears - mine are much less noticeable than the earbuds that came with my iPod and they rest pretty flat against my ear . My overall experience with these is quite positive . I 'm liking them more every day . They really do block out sound , so not only should you not wear them when driving or biking or running , you also shouldn't wear them when your spouse is around . I caught mine looking at me rather crossly the first night I got them ( they very nicely blocked out the sound of misbehaving children and my wife 's attempts to make them settle down ) , and I resolved not to use them at home unless everyone else is in bed .  
1	  I was very disappointed that this Ipod which I gave to my husband as a birthday gift came without a book of directions for use .  
1	  Could'nt get to work . Right chip specs my Dell Demension 2400 just wouldn't take it . Called PNY and they told me to return and buy a different manufacture memory chip . I returned and received my money back . I bought another brand and it worked fine . Excellent service from Amazon .  
2	  I bought this player a month ago to listen to ebooks downloaded from Netlibrary . It is very easy to get the file on to the player and listen to it . It has a resume feature where you pause the player and turn it off and when you turn it back on it remembers where you are in the book . Very nice ! However , because of my fat fingers I sometimes hit the wrong buttons and lose my place . Then it is a royal pain to fast forward to the spot in my book . It can take 15-20 minutes to fast forward 10 hours in a file and then it can be tricky to get it to stop in the right place . I contacted sandisk about getting the fast forward to have the abilitiy to go really fast forward if you hold the button down for a certain amount of time . Something like jumping ahead an hour instead of 20 second increments like it does now . They said they would think about it . I am looking for something else . In the meantime if I lose my space over 10 hours in or longer I listen from my laptop so I don't have to get frustrated sitting with a slow fast forward . Just thought I would share this with other audio book lovers looking for something to use . I am considering a pocket pc instead which has a mobile version of windows medio player and I can use the seek bar and slide to my spot in the file in 10 seconds . No resume though in those pocket pc from what I hear . May 2008 . There is a happy ending to this story . I found an mp3 player with a slide bar . It is a Cowon D2 and I love it . Been using it for the past 5 months and it works great for Netlibrary books . I highly recommend it for this application . The 2 gb size is plenty big for books , but you can get one with more memory . It has bookmarking and the few times I forgot to bookmark , I was able to click on the slide bar and I was back to my spot in the book . The battery life is phenomenal . Don't need a recharge for the life of a book and then some . Comes with ac power adapter so can recharge very quickly .  
2	  Bought this nearly 5 years ago when i got my 17 " Mac . Loved the slick design and it was one of the only ones out there with some color ! Easy to get into and has just the right amount of pockets . It has held up fantastically and now that I have purchased a new 17 " Mac , I 've been looking around for a new one and realize that I already bought the best !  
1	  bought 2 of this kind one of another none of the 3 worked but on one side , tried to re-route wires but to no avail , I just wanta a splitter to work on both sides , Greywolfesc  
1	  I bought this cable on sale , and it worked fine . No better or worse than any other optical audio cable . The main problem I have with this cable is that it broke when I removed it from the back of my DVR . Around the pin on each of the cable 's end there is a small , rectangular piece of plastic , a sort of a shield that guides and holds the end of the cable in place . On my Monster cable , this plastic piece came off , under normal use , rendering the cable useless as the cable will not set in place without it . Bottom line , avoid Monster and the overblown hype and just buy a cheap cable instead . It will work just as well , if not better .  
1	  I purchased this product , but after 3 months of frustrating use wound up throwing it away . The first problem is that the structural support of the power tips between the laptop plug and the cord plug is the electrical solder ! The effect of this is that if you use the adapter on the road where it 's subject to a lot of plug and unplug and varying mechanical stress , the solder breaks . You then at best have a tip with an intermittent connection . I replaced the tip twice before giving up and getting another better designed adapter . The second problem is that when I unplugged the power adapter from the wall , it would cause my laptop ( IBM T20 ) to emergency power off . Unplugged at the laptop plug was fine . I understand this to be an issue between the T20 power system and a surge issue in the adapter . I replaced this with a Kensington 33197 120W adapter . It looks almost like the same product ( same OEM ? ) except they have stronger power tips . It also didn't have the power-off issue . I loved the form factor , but the product just didn't work .  
2	  It works well for me . Before I bought it , I saw someone said something negative about this router . But the truth is it is compatiable with the windows vista . Easy install , stable signal . If the price can be lower a little bit , that would be best .  
2	  I don't understand the negative reviews of this product . It fits , it works well , and the price is competitive . The service is very fast , too .  
2	  Obviously this is an older product , and newer products have more and better features , nicer picture , and are cheaper . That being said , props to Samsung for delivering a product that has gotten used every day in my kitchen since I bought it 4 years ago , and is still working like the day I bought it . The newer TV 's will outshine this old girl , but she runs strong and really has a great picture . We watch this TV more than any other in the house , and the picture is bright even in the sunniest room !  
2	  So far , so good . As always Canon puts out a great product . This is my first digital camera but not my first Canon . It has so many features that if you don't use it all the time it 's easy to forget some of its features . I love that it fits all my other Canon lenses . So far , I 'm very happy with this camera and I plan on remaining loyal to Canon as long as they keep pumping out superior products .  
1	  I purchased this telescope for my son but he had such a hard time finding anything to focus on . Very hard to use  
2	  Used an APC surge protector like this for my computer station . It worked wonderfully for 7 yrs and until our house was flooded . This is a replacement .  
2	  I suggest you have a back up battery with any camera . It 's terrible to be shooting and loose power . I found other sites the give better deals on these though . Shop around .  
2	  There are lots of helpful remarks in the previous reviews . I 'll just add that the " 3-d " view provided by this and other Garmin units seems much easier to use with a quick glance than the top-down views on other units . Other than the size of the screen , this unit is superior to the nav system that came in my ' 03 Toyota Prius in every regard . It 's very easy to use . I should mention that my unit arrived about two weeks ago with system 2.1 on it . During our first trip using it , the unit froze while we were heading down Route 1 in central NJ . Power cycling it got us back on track , and we 've no other problems since . However , I just looked on the Garmin website and found that the current system for this unit is 3.2 , as of December 6 . Updating the system software on my PC in the office was quite simple , and I 'm glad that the unit will be ( presumably ) more stable than ever .  
1	  One of the channels went out at the end of the boating season . In all , lasted 4 months and now is essentially junk . I may of gotten a bad one , but didn't do the job .  
1	  SELLER CANCELLED ORDER THE FOLLOWING DAY FOR NO APPARENT REASON , THEREFORE TYING UP MONEY ON MY CREDIT FOR A FEW DAYS . ADVERTISEMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PULLED IF PRODUCT IS NOT AVAILABLE .  
1	  The docking caused my ipod to freeze up multiple times and always caused glitches in the music . I started using it with the cable to plug it into the speakers and not dock it , and the music sounded like it was in a bubble . The unit kept turning itself off every five minutes . Returned it after 3 days of constant baby sitting just to get it to work instead of being able to enjoy my music .  
1	  I bought this unit and within 2 months and little use .. it consistently said & quot ; no disk & quot ; was in the unit when clearly there was . The repairman at the local video shop told us the laser wasn't working properly and that it was pretty much JUNK and that is what we did with it . I wouldn't recommend a Samsung product to anyone without the purchase of a warranty of some type .  
1	  As other reviewers have written the first thing I noticed is that there are only 3 sheets , not 12 as the title implies . The way you achieve 12 sheets is by cutting them in fourths which makes them too small for my camera . I can get 6 sheets effectively . Furthermore , the kit comes with a wet cloth to clean the screen before applying . The drawback is that the kit comes with only wet cloth , so unless all 12 ( or 6 or 3 ) protectors are applied at once , the single will only be moist for the first application . Finally , I agree that it is very difficult to apply these cleanly . This product works great for a single use if you have the patience to apply them .  
2	  It works great ! All I needed to complete it was buying a wireless keyboard and mouse and bam ! I got to be a Lazy-boy ( aka couch ) potato . lol  
2	  When I read other reviews of this filter , I knew it was worth paying a few extra dollars for the quality of metal and glass . What I didn't realize is that a trip to WalMart after my purchase would reveal that this product was cheaper than an inferior brand made of all plastic ! Wow ! It really pays to shop around ! And they say you get what you pay for !  
2	  It is very easy to use , takes you to another level by having taken better control of the light , it allows yourself to know and to plan with accuracy what you want to obtain .  
1	  I 've known and happily used SanDisk CF cards before , high quality , good price . This Ultra II card comes with some worries . Since CF doesn't write at 9MB / sec , it uses a " buffer " to write a small amount ( like 4 megs ) to an ultra-fast buffer , then the image is slowly transferred to the main card . And there 's the problem . I lost every " last image " on my trip to Italy . When I powered on the camera , took say 5 pictures , it would record 4 and lose the last image . This is because I was turning the camera off after taking the 5th picture . I needed to leave the camera on another 20 seconds to be sure the memory card finished transfer of the images . So it 's very fast , for a small burst of pictures , but LEAVE THE CAMERA ON . I did a lot of " that 's cool ! " pictures .. you turn the camera on , take a picture , turn the camera off to save battery life . Mistake . Make sure you REVIEW the images ( and not just the temporary image displayed after the picture is taken ) before POWERING DOWN .  
2	  My Polycomms kept burning out so I tried this one - mainly for the speakerphone . Works great so far ( 4 months ) with good sound and controls .  
2	  this garmin is extremely good , love the bluetooth feature as well as the mp3 option . Map is detailed well , with easy to follow instructions  
2	  What can you say about a lens hood ? It works and the price is right . Good protection for the lens . Nuff said .  
1	  you can get a new one with specs that blow away this computer for only 100-200 more . This is great for everyday computing . Internet , docs . But if you run editing software , record and edit music , or are a download junkie . Spend the extra 100 or take the time to shop around . Has tiger OSX which was great for PRO TOOLS , but half gig memory won't cut it . PS / you risk breaking computer changing the memory , very delicate , made in mac mini ' early stages .  
2	  Just purchased this at Frys for $ 25 , my second set after 4 years , used for workouts , has held up well .  
1	  Upon receiving the product ( new and sealed in the factory box ) the very first thing I noticed was the lens . It was lightly scratched across the display and in one small area it was marred as though solvent was spilled upon it during manufacturing . Given to its cost one would think the manufacturer would apply a removable plastic film over the lens to protect it from such things . I did speak directly with Independent Technologies and was told I would need to return it to the vendor who would in turn return it to them . In essence , they 'd prefer to have you jump through the hoops . The manufacture 's warranty clearly states that defective units will be accepted provided they are accompanied by the original receipt showing date and place of purchase . The individual I spoke to told me that had I purchased the unit directly from Independent Technologies they would handle the problem . Admittedly , I neglected to recite the company 's warranty information to her . The product works as advertised but there doesn't appear to be much concern over the quality of it 's appearance . Just a note .. there are similar products out there for your consideration .  
1	  I have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to Windows Vista . As a result of the Windows upgrade , this product just lost half its value for me . The drive works fine physically , but the included backup software will not work with Vista when I try to schedule an overnight backup ; the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling . As others have noticed here , Western Digital offers ZERO support for its software - I cannot even find an indication that they recognize there is a problem .  
2	  This is a really great portable Ipod player . It has great sound and is perfect for outside on your deck or patio as well as anywhere in the house . We take it camping with us . Everything is stored inside . Just zip it up and go . It 's hard to believe something so small could work so well .  
2	  Memorex discs are always a good deal . I use them for DVD and CD authoring and have never ( yes , never ) encountered a problem with them . And you can usually find them on sale !  
2	  When I first bought this machine I thought , " Nice laptop , but do I really want to shell out all that money ? " Let me just say , " Yes ! " The only reason I gave this notebook a four rating as opposed to a five , was .. you guessed it , the short battery life . But do not let this discourage you , this notebook handles everything you throw at it , chews it , digests it and gives it back to you in the form of a work of art ! Pros : clear screen , bright / sharp colors , excellent processor speed , overall feel of the machine is accomodating , very few to none hardware limitations . Cons : Battery life is too .. short !  
1	  My first unit didn't even wok , so i had to replace it . Second one worked . Not an expensive unit , but sound quality is medium at best . Remote is not very helpful , bulky in size .  
2	  This combo pack was a great price . This is a better way to buy your ink then buying it seperately . I recommend buying from amazon .  
2	  Ok so I have now been using the rebel xti for a few months , and shot hundreds and hundreds perhaps thousands of pictures . Yes it is a good camera , and yes it will satisfy most first time SLR users needs . BUT BE WARNED , if you are planing to get serious there are better choices out there ! I originally stated that I was able to shoot a number of sports ( soccer , hockey , rugby ) with no trouble , and I still stand by that . However even a couple hundred more dollars will get you the 30D and in my opinion its a way better deal . Its not quite as easy to use button and menu wise , but thats something you can get used to ! The AF is way faster and quieter , the increase in fps is a HUGE advantage for sports , the body feels great ( maybe not for small hands ) and is heavier which provides balance when hand holding L series telephoto such as the 70-200 f / 4L . I just recently used the 30D with the 70-200 f / 4L for a collegiate soccer game and let me tell you the difference was amazing . Compared to the xti and 70-200 the AF was way way faster . It made all the difference , and a lot more of my shots came out useable . If you have the extra money I would highly recommend the 30D over the xti . Ultimately go hold them both , but the 30D just feels better and more solid . If your shooting an elementary school game the xti is great , but if your planning on doing anything semi serious the extra couple hundred is worth it . I give this camera four stars because I wont deny that it is a a good camera , however I leave out the fifth star because it lacks that extra kick of the 30D and obviously more expensive cameras . Plus the shutter on the 30D sounds way better . lol .  
2	  I recently bought the mp3run about three months ago . I was a little hesitant after reading the mixed reviews , but I thought I 'd take a shot at it . I 'm glad I did . I 'm training for my first marathon this September and the mp3run has made my runs thoroughly enjoyable . Calibration is fairly accurate with the factory settings . It allows you to custom calibrate around a 400M track if you so desire . Several reviews were negative on the software component / uploading of music . I haven't found this to be a problem . The rechargeable battery is nice . Fit is comfortable around the arm . Headphones that come with the player are fine . Pedometer sensor that is strapped on the shoe is so lightweight I don't notice it . I 've run in rain with this thing on and it hasn't skipped a beat . The only disadvantages I 've encountered is that 1-you can't run to the radio if you are calibrating a run and 2-sometimes the on demand distance button won't give readings . To offset this second problem , I 've set the device to give me readings at every mile . You can chose auto feedback at distance intervals or time intervals . That information is nice . It tells you how far you 've run , your total time running , and the current pace at which you are running . I am planning on continuing my running in the future . After my marathon , as a gift , I 'll probably get me a garmin 301 forerunner for my distances , heart rate , pace , etc . I 'll still strap on my mp3run for my tunes , however . Happy running . Just do it !  
2	  It is well built and nice but it doesn't fit 15 " laptop in the padded compartment . My 15.4 " laptop is few years old and it not one of those wide screen . Maybe a 15 " mac would fit . The bag needed to have been at least 1 " wider for my laptop . However , you can put the laptop in another compartment which is not padded , in which case I am not sure what you would use the padded compartment for !  
1	  Replaced an old Blaupunkt cassette unit with this one mainly because of the USB function . On paper this unit sounds outstanding - MP3 with ID3 tag display , USB input , 200 watts , etc .. Unfortunately I have not had much luck in getting the usb port to read any mp3 files from any flash media ( have tried 5 different brands now ) . Of note is that it does recognize the usb media being connected but is unable to recognize the MP3 files on it . Also , the CD mechanism is by far and away the worst I have ever seen - It will skip just sitting in the driveway , not even driving ! Completely unsat for a car audio system . Next time I am going to stick with a major brand and spend the extra money . The only good thing to say is that is seems to have good sound quality so if you listen to the radio all the time this unit would be alright .  
2	  It 's a Sony . It plays MP3s . Battery life is fantastic , and it takes plain ' AA ' cells you can buy anywhere . Anti-skip is perfectly adequate for walking and the occasional jog across the street or run to catch a bus . Plus , it has enough output power to drive a set of in-ear headphones to painful ear-damaging volume levels . Works fine with all the CD-Rs and CD-RWs I 've burnt with my QPS burner ; maybe lafnsam is using no-name CDs . ( Why , when TDKs are so iinexpensive ? ) Only two downsides to this player : The supplied headphones are worthless ( a common problem with portables ) , and there 's noticable hiss during silence . Still , it 's great .  
2	  i just got this yamaha ystms50 , and i think this system are the best , and i think ya should buy this system if ya dont got 1 .  
2	  I hooked this up and it was replacing my 2.1 system . Man does this thing rock . For the price you simply can't beat the quality that these speakers have . They have great low end and good mid , but the weird thing is when you really crank it the sound quality gets better ! I would definitely recommend buying this if you can't afford the high end stuff . Great product , I am glad i bought it .  
1	  I bought this because I thought ( from the picture ) that it was a small , slim unit that held all of the power cords inside . Nope . Turns out the cord from the wall to the power converter , when wrapped up , is about as big as the power converter itself . Only the cord that plugs into the computer tucks inside the unit . Very dishonest marketing by Sony . The standard power supply is actually smaller and more portable than this thing , and it costs less . I will try to upload photos of this unit and the regular one . No complaints with Amazon , though . Naturally , this thing will be going straight back .  
1	  After reading all the reviews and owning this product for 2 months , I feel that I didn't do a good buy . The unit overall is satisfying , but the problem starts coming after you come out of a underground garage or once you lost signal . The system never aquires the signal and I had to turn it off and on to get the sigals back . This becomes very critical especially if you come out of the covered garages and directly on roads and have no freaking idea about direction . The system would useless as you will taking rounds and rounds of the block till you get satellite signal .. big big flaw ..  
1	  I loved this mouse for six months . Worked great , easy to connect , battery lasted about two months . Then yesterday it died . The scroll wheel stopped scrolling . It feels like it 's stripped . It has a three year warranty , but for the cost of shipping , and the hassle , and the fact that I only paid twelve bucks , I just bought a new one . Found a Logitech at Best Buy for twenty five bucks , seems a little sturdier . This was not a good buy . I gave it two stars because it is what it is . A cheap little mouse good for about six months .  
1	  Bought this for my son . Most common functions were intuitive but we still needed to read the manual a lot . However , the pics were very grainy . My old 2MP Fuji Finepix had better resolution . We returned the Vivitar for a Samsung Digimax 360 ( 3.2 MP ) which we like much better .  
1	  I purchased the HueyPro for its reputable " Pantone " name . Well , SURPRISE ! The HueyPro gave me consistent pinkish unusable color profiles . After doing research online and looking at other reviews , I see this is a common problem recognized by Pantone . Very disappointed . So I followed Pantone 's instructions to request a replacement . The autoreply said expect a reply in 24 hours . That was sent over 10 days ago , still no response . NOT RECOMMENDED ! Unreliable product from an unreliable company  
2	  Not much in the way of directions for this but at least Axiom returned my call . It supports USB memory sticks up to 2 GB in size . Keep all your pictures in the same folder , it does not support multiple folders . The price was right , it looks good , and is relatively easy to operate .  
1	  I recently purchased this camera and was very disappointed . I am hoping to return it . The photos come out with a greenish haze and are not very focused . I tried photos inside , outside and in my office and they all turned out the same . I also had difficulty installing the camera on my HP tower . I contacted Logitech support and it took 2 days for the first reply which was that i needed to call in from 7am to 5pm PST . Those are my work hours . When I responded this was not satisfactory , I got an email with instructions that I finally was able to get the camera installed . You get what you pay for . A disposable camera with 35mm film takes way better photos .  
2	  I really like this camera . The biggest bonus to the camera is how adaptable it is . If you are a novice , it can be used as a simple point-and-shoot camera , and it has several scene selections ( portrait , landscape , sport , night , etc . ) . If you are a more advanced user , this camera is great too . It has several levels of customizability : choose one function and allow the camera to determine the rest , or you can select ALL the settings yourself . The camera has threads on the lens , so it is essentially upgradeable , with more advanced telephoto ( not that you need it with a 10X optical zoom built in ) , macro and other lens attachments available through Olympus . Or you could attach filters . It is as close as you can get to an SLR without paying an arm and a leg . The C-765UZ has an electronic viewfinder . Many people don't like EVFs , but I love it . I have some visual difficulties , and sometimes can't really see through an optical viewfinder . The EVF is very bright and clear . It is even manageable in low light settings . It was the brightest EVF of any camera in its class that I tested . Many people may say that the C-765UZ is a little pricey compared to other 10X zoom cameras . However , those other brands are usually 3MP instead of the 4MP of the C-765UZ . In addition , the optics on the Olympus C-Series is generally superior to those other camera . Remember you get what you pay for ! Plus the C-765 is the SMALLEST 10X optical zoom camera on the market today ( Spring 2005 ) . The only complaints I have are with the packaged accessories . Olympus only provides a 16MB xD card , so you need to add a 256MB card to your initial purchase . Also , Olympus provides the Li-10B rechargeable battery , but the " replacement " 12B battery has a higher capacity . It would have been nice to get the better battery in the initial bundle . Oh , and speaking of batteries , the C-765UZ ONLY takes the rechargeable Li-10B / 12B batteries , so if your battery is running low you can't just throw in a few AA 's to get by until another charge . It keeps the size and weight down , but trades convenience .  
2	  The recorder has performed just as I expected . The sound quality is fine , the controls are intuitive and easy to operate , and battery life is acceptable . I especially like the three recording modes , so you can do dictation , record a one-on-one discussion or podcast , or a large lecture , and get good sound quality with the proper mode set . No complaints .  
2	  I bought this to protect my actual lens and it paid huge dividends . Not sure how it happened but I took the camera out of the camera bag and the protection filter was cracked like a spider web . Fotunately , the lens underneath it didn't have a scratch on it . If I hadn't spent the little bit of money on the lens filter , I would have been looking a costly repair of a $ 1500 lens .  
2	  I had not planned on upgrading to the D80 from my D70 , but around Christmas , a local camera store had a 20 % coupon for nearly anything in the store , including the D80 . So , my plans changed . I have been a Nikon shooter for a number of years , and my most recent 35mm SLR is a Nikon N80 . So , the D70 had a very familiar look and feel to it , and I found the transition from film to digital was pretty comfortable . I researched the D70 for months before buying it and had extremely high expectations for the camera , all of which were exceeded . The D80 retains all the great features of the D70 with improved imaging , new features , and an excellent system of buttons , dials , and menus . I have really enjoyed shooting with the D80 and find I use a number of different approaches depending on my shooting subject . Aperture preferred , shutter preferred , program , etc . All have their merits . I think that DSLRs today are fantastic , and all the good brands have great offerings . So we can hardly go wrong any more . Since I had the experience with Nikons and some good lenses , I decided to stick with Nikon and have been most pleased . Nikon 's approach is to focus on image quality , no pun intended . There is less emphasis with bells and whistles , compared with some other brands . The competition among the big DSLR manufacturers is fantastic for us digital shooters . This is a great camera , but I think that Nikon should provide Capture NX , its imaging software developed by Nik and Nikon , should not be an add-on at additional expense . Other manufacturers provide that imaging software for free , and I wish there were an ultrasonic dust remover , but this camera is a pleasure to use . Hope this helps you make a decision .  
2	  I got the Sony MVC-FD75 as a gift for christmas and im so happy with it and the pics it takes . Its so easy to use and with a floppy disk you can e-mail pics much faster then with a camera with port cables you have to hook up to your PC .  
1	  Read the other reviews about the mouse pointer jumping to the bottom corners of the screen . This mouse just FEELS wrongs to use , I threw mine in a drawer and now use my old Microsoft Mouse . This disappointed me , because I have always loved Microsoft Mice , and have an IntelliEye mouse at work that is the best .. Spend more money and buy another mouse , and dont throw out the packaging !  
2	  Its very easy and quick for everyone , even more easier than xbox live 100 % recomended , easy simply and faster . If you have any questions you can ask to support and they will asist you  
1	  I don't even use it anymore , didn't think it was that great . I got a gel rest from fellows , a lot better ..  
2	  I upgraded from a Nikon D50 to the D80 . I have really enjoyed the extra features that the D80 provides . It is a great camera , a great purchase !  
2	  The product is excellent , though , in size , it is larger than you 'd think from the illustration . Using a CD for the alarm is a great idea . I now awaken to the Baron Ochs waltz , Opus 89 , from Richard Strauss'Das Rosenkavalier ! Devine ! And I imagine Jeanette Mac Donald singing new words to this music , words crafted by a brilliant Hollywood lyricist and used in the movie " Three Daring Daughters . " Not a bad way to start the day !  
2	  can't go wrong with good sounds and a great price ; use them for secondary set of stereo speakers in the living room , good crisp sound and sufficinet base , don't need a subwoofer for these .  
2	  My husband and I were looking for a way to store our dvd 's . We have so many , and with not too large of a home , we needed something that we could easily move and make things more pleasing to the eye . We ordered two cases and are thrilled . They are HUGE , but if you need the storage , definitely worth it :) Would 100 % order again and will if we need more storage !  
2	  I have purchased and used several of these Internet cams both at home and at work . They work very well once set up , but they may require highly technical skills and knowledge to set up depending on your network environment . I like them because they have a window that shows the IP address they have picked up . This is a problem I encountered with the newer version . Without an IP address window on the device , I would have to search the network and hope the software is able to pick up the device . The software works well in very small networks , but on enterprise networks it can get confused and sometimes can not find the camera .  
1	  I had this external dvd writer for less than 3 years , and it has stopped working . I used it very seldom - maybe once a month - and it still died so quickly . Now it makes a repetitive clicking sound when I put in any cd or dvd - whether a commercial program cd or a new blank one . Nothing else happens . I emailed the Lite-on tech support , but they never replied . Good-bye , Lite-on , from my life !  
2	  This is the third portable , usb speaker I 've purchased for my laptops . But , this is the only one that actually works , and it works very well . Crisp , clear sound that has good volume ( as compared to the other small speakers , which were barely an improvement over the built-in laptop speakers ) and a good range of sound . You don't have to install the software that comes with it , which I couldn't do because it 's not supported on Windows Vista . But , even without the software , it is brilliant . I 'm going to buy another one for my other laptop now ! UPDATE 3/3/2010 : After almost 3 years , this speaker is still going strong for me . Fantastic !  
1	  Installation was no problem , and it worked fine until today , when all of the letters on the left side quit working ! ( I used it about a month , and not a " hard " use either ) .  
1	  I bought this Toshiba SD-1800 about 6 months ago . It seemed to work fine .. on DVDs only , we don't play CDs or other discs on it .. About a month ago it started having the following symptoms : A DVD will play for a little bit starting out . Then the picture will get " shadowy " , almost like a negative photo . Picture will then start and stop , and then finally stop alltogether . Happens on all DVDs . It seems to me this is some sort of temperature sensitve problem . Once the player warms up it starts having these problems . Based on this and after reading other reviews I would NOT RECOMMEND purchasing this player at all . And it brings into question the Toshiba name in terms of reliability and quality . Toshiba is not high on my list right now .  
2	  Okay , I 'm not a professional photographer but I do know what I like . Great product . I am very satisfied . Great picture .  
1	  I received this camera as a Christmas gift last year from my husband . We had a baby , so I 've spent the past year taking many pictures . I have only about 40 % that turned out decently . The others are blurry , dark , and lots of red eye . I 've tried every possible setting combination and I can't get consistently good pictures . My husband thought it was the way I was taking the pictures , so when he tried , he realized he got the same crappy results . Its a shame because he paid a lot of money for it and we trusted the Sony name , but this Christmas , on the advice of a world traveling friend , I 'm asking for a Canon ..  
1	  Don't buy this hunk of JUNK ! I got it like 3 months ago and it was working great ! I thought it was great having a portable DVD player . I would watch like 1 movie 3 times a week . It was all good I had fun and crap and then about 7 weeks later I was watchuing Mean Girls and it stopped in the middle of the film , I turned it off cleaned the disc and put it back in I decided to watch start over because I love the movie so much and it started skipping I tried cleanijng it again but the these stupid annoying lines started coming up . My daddy tried everything to fix it and nothing happened . It was a stupid piece of CRAP ! They wouldn't refund the stupid piece of CRAP so we threw it away . It 's a good thing that my dad bought me another portable DVD player that actually works and this one is an actual brand . I 'm warning you people who want to but this excuse of a DVD player , DONT !  
1	  10.80V ( Compatible with 11.10V ) , 4000mAh , Li-ion , Hi-quality Replacement Laptop Battery for TOSHIBA Satellite 5000 , TOSHIBA Satellite A100 , 5005 , 5100 , 5105 Series , Compatible Part Numbers : B499 , PA3123U-1BRS , PA3178 , PA3178U , PA3178U-1BAS , PA3178U-1BRS , P. . The service from the vendor was great . The battery fit and I charged it fully . When fully charged the battery only gives me ONE hour of service . I expected more , maybe next time I 'll go with the real item instead of one that is " compatible " .  
2	  I 've owned mine for about two months now , after ' learning the important settings ' ( took me about 10 minutes of reading ) the Sony camera offers me quality that out-does my Olympus 4040 ( which is a very good camera in it 's own right . ) Those settings i spoke about are fairly easy to navigate when you need more control ( as i do ) above and beyond the High Quality automatic setting on the Sony for taking snapshots and such . The Olympus has a very bright much larger lens than the Sony W7 , but the Sony is superior in many ways . The first , and most important , is that when i click the shutter , i get a photo . Not two seconds later , but right now . My wife , a dancer , also loves the quailty of photos taken in low light and movement both with and without a flash . Sure , there is a little bit of low light loss of quailty with the Sony AND the flash disabled , but .. i am asking a pocket style camera to do the work of a high quality 35 mm slr or the large frame Olympus 4040 used to do ( till it failed , which is the reason for the Sony purchase ) . I also owned a Nikon for about 24 hours ( similar to the Sony in size and what it says it will do ) but i found out after frustration , the Nikon does not do what it says it will . I had focus problems like other people who bought the Nikon camera . So , i was getting ' very high quality out of focus photos ' with the Nikon .. enough said . Parents ( and sportsmen / women ) will LOVE this camera ( the Sony DSC-W7 ) because they can actually get those impromptu photos children ( animals and sports ) are so famous for ! ( I 've got some close up shots of chipmunks and birds at the window feeder ! ) The camera turns on and is ready to shoot in just over one second ( on my watch ) and when you hit the shutter ( with flash disabled ) it 's like the 35mm 's instantainous shutter .. THIS CAMERA DOES MORE ! The quality of those photos is almost cruel to the passing of time , it is now frozen on film .. as it were . The Sony has made me ' the photographer ' of my wife 's bellydance troupe . So , in conclusion .. today i 'm a very happy man with my new job and the camera that brought it to me ! - loudboyps . I also bought a 1 gig chip and an AC power supply . And , if you should purchase a Sony W7 ( or W5 too i 'm told ! ) you should stock up on 8.5 X 11 inch frames cuz the photos are that good ! True , it takes a larger size photo ( 7.2mp ) , but i only have a letter size printer . I have bought computer games that made me want to upgrade my video card , but now i own a camera that makes me want to up grade my printer ! I am truly happy with my Sony DSC-W7 . That 's my story , and i 'm sticking to it !  
1	  Want a frustrating part time job with no pay ? Buy a Zune . I bought mine back in October . Plays music just fine . The nightmare is managing the music files and updates . I use a trusted software program - Media Monkey - to manage all my music files on my PC . When I did the initial setup the Zune grabbed all of the music files from Media Monkey . When I went into my Zune Library , most of the CD 's were broken into 2 pieces , with some songs in one file and some in another . So I spent a lot of time in my Zune library trying to put the files back together . Some changes were accepted , some would not stick . I spent a lot of time making changes , syncing to my Zune device , and then finding new problems in the library . Then I tried to update to a new version and the updates fail with no real explanation other than to " close all programs and try again " . When I went to the support site I read way to many horror stories about the update , so I guess I 'm lucky it failed . And don't even think you 're going to get real support for this thing . Microsoft 's idea of support is user self service . They want us to read through pages and pages of user suggestions to find our fix . So I 'm not going to update , I 'll work with what I have . And when my Zune dies I 'll buy an iPod . And then I 'll replace my PC with a Mac . Then I will be free from the crappy software from Microsoft .  
1	  I was very unimpressed with these speakers . I was simply looking for a decent pair of speakers to put on my patio with an old low power tuner . With the loudness setting off and the Bass BELOW the center mark , the speakers rattle as if I were playing them for a party . I would not reccomend the purchase of these speakers to anyone who actually enjoys even decent quality sound .  
1	  It doesn't work . I returned it for a refund . Simply does not work . Oh well .  
2	  An updated review . Mine " broke " today from normal usage . Basically soemthing is going on inside the wire that is closest to the jack . Possibly a kink due to it not being able to " bend nicely " out from the jack . But overall , this is a great headphone . Deep and clear sound . I think I 'll order a few more for the future before they don't make this anymore .  
1	  After less than two years of service my Beltronics V955 stopped working . I contacted Beltronics and was charged $ 59.95 to repair the unit . It came back to me saying the power switch was replaced . I did get the same unit back that I had sent in . Though I am content with the radar detector 's performance I feel that I was forced to pay too much for repairs too soon after purchasing the item . It is not a cheap instrument . I paid aprox $ 150 + for it and could not afford to replace it when it broke . I think Beltronics should be more reasonable with repairs that are not the fault of the owner . It was not a question of any type of misuse created the power switch breakdown . For this reason I will not purcahse another Beltronics device .  
1	  I found that the camera was not as good as they had admitted . Oh dont get me wrong for the price it 's great ( for outdoors in daylight ) it takes a good picture but still pixelated and it does show up " boxy "  
2	  They work perfectly and considering some that i 've bought in the past , these actually fit all the way around my ears rather than feeling like they are crushing them against the side of my head .  
1	  I migh have a defective printer but this is what I encountered . I want 2 computers to share this printer . I connected one PC via the Ethernet port , everything printed good . I than connected second PC on the USB port , everthing worked great . But the first PC can no longer print to the printer on the Ethernet port . The printer didn't even appear on the DHCP list . It just seem using the USB port would disable the Ethernet port forgood . Emailed to HP about this , no reply yet . Has anyone else had this problem ?  
2	  This is a spectacular set . A techie friend visited my house and said " you really did your research . " He had bought the same set after weeks of research ! I couldn't be happier with the picture quality and value .  
2	  I only needed a bag that would hold my Rebel XT and one zoom lens . Fits perfectly .  
2	  I was skeptical about purchasing a digital camera . I thought I would not get great performance but wow , I was wrong . It has preformed well for me in temperature ranges form 10 degrees to 106 degrees . This camera is easy to use and has a large screen . Even the manual setting are easy to understand and use . I use it almost exclusivly now over my 35mm camera .  
1	  I was originally looking at a pair of in-ear headphones with a head-band for use in working out and ended up with these by mistake . Overall sound quality is average to good with noteworthy enhancement in Bass response and the obvious sound isolation you would expect from an in-ear sealed design . Not on par with Sure or other higher end models . Physical design is disappointing . They don't feel particularly secure in my ears even with the smaller silicone inserted ( BTW I am 6'2 " ) , and for reasons known only to Sony and some Asian design engineers hopped on a coffee and Sake buzz , the earphone cords are of an un-even length which places all of the hanging-pressure of the headphones on only one ear , making them more likely to pull out . The cord is also quite short ( less than two feet ) and will not allow you to hang a music player off your beltline without the additional extension cord they provided . I can see the logic process here was geared towards people using the player around their neck or arm perhaps ? But the poor / uneven cord design coupled with the extension cord makes using the extension cord an unpleasant experience . Overall I 'd say if you are stationary this weird design would be acceptable but not optimal , if you are walking aruond at all ( what a crazy idea for PORTABLE music player ) , it is not acceptable at all .. For that reason I cannot recommend this pair of headphones ..  
2	  I 've had this camera for a few months now , and it has been carted around in a modified Altoids tin in my pocket with no ill effects . 1 . Pros : - Size : This camera is tiny considering its 4MP resolution and 3x optical zoom ( this is because of a unique lens arrangement ) . - Lens : The range of the lens is perfect-too many digicams aren't wide enough , but this one gets to about 35mm ( 35mm equivalent ) . The quality is pretty good considering the camera 's size . It won't compete with a much larger , more expensive lens on " prosumer " digicams , but they won't fit in your pocket , and what good is a better lens if you don't have the camera ? - Image Quality : Excellent image quality for a camera in this size and price range . Will print out 8 x 10 inch prints without a problem ( assuming you don't crop too much ) . There 's a little lens distortion at the edges at the wide end , but nothing abnormal for sub-compact . 2 . Cons : -I think there 's a slightly newer version that is either out , or soon will be . Check Pentax 's website . - Shot-2-Shot : The shot-to-shot time is pretty slow ( feels like a second or so at high quality ) . - Focus : Doesn't focus well in low-light , which makes it hard to take pictures at dusk or later unless you turn off the auto-focus .  
2	  These are simply the best containers of this sort that I have ever purchased . Amazon discounts are excellent . Very durable . Aesthetically pleasing . Clips are very strong and my take some prying to get them open . Actually nicked a knuckle getting one open . I used a little WD40 on them , which did help . The Otter boxes can take a lot of rough treatment - tossed into pocket books , etc , which no apparent damage or change in appearance . the Universal al case is a big large to put in your handbag . I use this size of batteries and electronics . The 1000 series made a really great coin box for the laundry room , The blue box is padded - very nice - but makes it too small for many devices . Yellow box is nice for private items like meds or sanitary supplies . No complaints at all so ar . Just wish that I could buy larger ones affordably . UI use clear vinyl briefcase from My Backpack . com . Women , even strangers , seem mesmerized by it and come up an comment and complement . Still working on the dream of the perfect handbag . Good for working at agencies where high visibility is appreciated or even mandated .  
1	  I have noticed this router typically begins to fail after 6 months of use . By fail , I mean it starts dropping connections and has trouble reconnecting to the WAN.A router should not have to be reset ( or unplugged ) every day . IT should just be plugged in and work constantly . My router started getting flaky after a year , but my mother has gone through two of these in one year . I think its time Linksys get to addressing their customer 's concerns .  
2	  This is a great photo quality printer . My husband is a professional nature photographer , and we now print photos that we sell framed in local galleries with this printer . But as the computer person in the family , I 'm happy that the ink cartridges last a relatively long time for the number of prints . I printed about 50 5X7 's , plus a bunch of a couple of hundred black and white documents on one set of ink cartridges .  
2	  This eyepiece filter is ideal for moon viewing . It works very well with aCelestron 93230 8 to 24mm 1.25 Zoom Eyepiece . The polarizing filter can be tightened in the eyepiece holder and then the eyepiece tightened in the filter . This allows twisting the eyepiece to zoom and sliding the lever to adjust the brightness . A basic moon filter cuts down on the intensity but require extra effort to attach and detach it . The Orion 1.25 " Variable Polarizing Filter for Telescope Eyepieces is popular but also requires additional steps to attach and detach it . The Meade filter is much quicker to install and remove . It also works for terrestrial viewing : reducing glare and reducing overly bright scenes .  
1	  but after sending back the first one for a buzz in the speaker , my second one has the same thing ! Unusable !  
2	  Shortly after I bought this ( before it arrived ) I began to suffer buyer 's remorse ; I started thinking this was just an expensive toy and a waste of money . But after receiving it [ and the North American detailed street maps chip ( another $ 160 ) ] I don't regret a single penny spent . It 's great for mapping ( showing a route , down to the foot , you 've taken ) so you can backtrack and not get lost while hiking . And , with the North American street maps microSD Data card , I travel to new destinations stress-free now . With the detailed street map chip , it gives driving directions as well as any automotive gps with the exception that the 60CSx doesn't give voiced instructions and , of course , the screen is smaller . And it 'll show all the restaurants ( or gas stations , atms , etc ) near my location and sorts them according to distance . This comes in handy when you 're in an unfamiliar area and need a Starbucks STAT . I know , this is starting to be a review of the Maps microSD Data chip / card , but I think anyone buying this unit should definitely invest in the extra chip , too . Doing so makes the unit many times more useful . Regarding battery usage , it has accomodations for both alkaline and lithium batteries ( supposedly lithium batteries have more energy than alkalines and can cause problems with some electronic devices ) . And I find that the 20 hour battery life is accurate as long as you don't use the backlight too much . When I first got this , I was playing with it all the time , using the back light and got about 10 hours on Duracell Ultra alkaline batteries . It also has other cool features like the ability to tell you the exact location ( current or any time in the future ) of the sun or moon . How cool would it be to know where the shade will be when you get out of that Phoenix movie theatre and have your car already parked there , in a spot that was blazing hot two hours earlier ? Knowing the exact time the sun will set or rise can come in handy , too . When I first got it , I didn't care for the economy of buttons on the device . But after using it almost daily for two weeks now I appreciate that I can effectively operate the unit with one hand because of the smart design / layout of the buttons . I 'd also invest twenty bucks in a protective case . The case is nicely designed with very good functionality allowing you to clearly see the screen and operate the buttons through a thick , tough , transparent barrier .  
1	  I agree with the other reviewer - these are flimsy , cheap and not worth a penny .  
2	  To begin with I 'm not a techie and I don't know a tweeter from a woofer . I just wanted to copy my CD collection ( and possibly my cassettes ) so I could listen to them anytime , anywhere . I researched all the choices and read everyone 's reviews and decided on the iRiver IHP-40 primarily because of its memory size and comments made by manufacturers that they don't think people are interested in large memory capacity ( worried they 'd stop making this size ) . The first thing to do when your iRiver arrives is to find the hold button on both devices and change its position . It is shipped with the hold " on " which may explain why some people couldn't get it to work from the get go . You should also go to the main menu and under display change backlighting battery and adapter . They 're set for 3 seconds and you can't navigate fast enough before it turns off . The data management system shipped on the disc only works if you 're going to use MP3 files . Its useless if you 're going to copy WMA files . But that 's OK , I 'm using a computer with Windows XP and you don't need the disc at all and the data management system already on the IHP-40 works just great . But if you are going to use MP3 's and installed the disc you have to go into the main menu and under ' general ' turn on the DB scan in order to use it . Another thing to know is that a friend tried reformatting per page 3 and the IHP-40 is too large to format using FAT32 ( at least with Windows 2000 and Windows XP ) so don't go down that road . You can get help online . You may have to wait , but they will answer your question . The phone number they give connects to a machine that takes your name and number and someone will call you in two days . It isn't THAT difficult to navigate , after a few minutes you start getting used to it . The case is brown and ugly . I use a generic CD waist belt holder when I 'm listening . That way its ' secure and doesn't advertise the fact that I have something expensive to steal . I really wish it could record from the radio , but that 's my only complaint . I 've copied 172 CDs so far ( classical and jazz ) and haven't had any problems downloading additions everyday . Have more CDs to copy . I 've also copied a radio program recorded by my Crane recorder ( its like a radio VCR ) directly from the Crane to the IHP-40 . Only complaint is you can only record in MP3 or WAV format and I 'm trying to conserve space and use WMA files as much as possible . Had concerns about the life of the battery ( a lot of money if it isn't going to last forever ) , but there are places online that sell replacement batteries and instructions for most all of the hard drive jukeboxes . I wouldn't have purchased any of them if I couldn't replace the battery , just too much money for throw away technology . So far I 'm very pleased with the iRiver-IHP0-40 . No more messing with CD cases , CDs in a different location from where I am when I want to listen , changing CDs or being connected to a large disc changer ( listen with earphones ) when I have to move around . I would recommend buying this if a friend asked me . I 'd suggest reading all the reviews , because you learn alot about how to work the machine before it arrives . Would give it 5 stars , but that 's perfection . Think it should be rated 4 1/2 stars ( because of not being able to record from the radio ) .  
2	  This printer is everything I expected it to be and more . The quality of the prints are awesome - indistinguishable from real photographs , except for the lack of " Kodak " or " Fuji " printed on the backside . The print speed is as advertised , and its incredibly easy to use . I would highly recommend this printer to anyone who wants an easy solution for quality prints . If I had to list drawbacks : - Limited to 4x6 or credit card size photos - Paper / Ink only available online ( haven't found a local retailer yet .. ) - Price per photo ( ~ 56 cents for the 4x6 prints ) more expensive than online orders ( ie . , shutterfly ) , but you get instant results , and no S & H. :-) If these are not a problem for you , then this is the printer you want . Get the CP-200 if you don't care about the rechargeable battery and credit card tray ( I think you can order the latter separately .. ) . The CP-300 is about $ 100 more , but worth it , in my opinion .  
2	  After receiving an email titled " Best MP3 Player you never heard of " I reasearched the Archos 605 MP3 Player . It was hard to find anything negitive about the 605 . I purchased the Archos 605 about 1 month ago and now can confirm that it trully is the best MP3 Player on the market . There is nothing that cant be done with the 605 , from Wi-Fi internet browsing to music to the best quality video of any player today .  
1	  BE WARE . This product was designed specifically for use with TINY mp3 players like the ipod shuffle ( which is , in my opinion , another ridiculous product ) and is not much use for anything else . The cord is hardly a foot long . I had to return it immediately .

1	  I purchased this unit to facilitate the exchange of jpeg 's between my Sony Digital Camara and my desktop PC . While you can read and write data to the Memory Stick Reader with the PC , when you attempt to download files created on a Sony camara it will give an error of " The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable . " The same files are accessible in my camara or Sony Notebook : they cannot be accessed with the SmartDisk Reader . My attempts with SmartDisk Technical Support were unsuccessful . Don't purchase thid unit if you plan to use it with genuine Sony hardware .  
1	  I have had my partner 's palm 505 replaced for 3 times now . The latest problem is with its battery . I 've had two other palms a V and IIc which both don't have any problems and still are going strong . The 505 is a disaster ! It deserves a recall or a class suit . It has caused us sleepless nights thinking how to recover lost data .  
2	  It 's getting harder to find VHS tapes . Our local Walgreen 's used to carry them but don't anymore . This is a value pack and are perfect to replace old VHS tapes so they won't mess up your machine ( also getting harder to find ! ) .  
2	  This is a very compact , nicely made product , but it is very tight to get on my belt and the hole for the camera wrist strap is difficult to pull though the hole in the top of the case . I just let mine hang to the side when it is on my belt and make the effort to pull the wrist strap through when it is in my purse .  
1	  I bought this product for almost $ 150.00 and had nothing but problems . The sub would cut in and out NONSTOP ! I even had to open it up and solder the spider wires to the subwoofer because I guess it wasn't worth their time to do when they made this terrible product . Even after that it didn't work . I called Pyle and they told me that I had to pay $ 20 + to ship it to them .. and if they didn't think it was a reasonable reason for me to send it back .. they would not give me a refund or a new product . Eventually I got it working and it worked great for about 30 minutes .. then the amp shorted and blew the fuse .. but not before it had the opportunity to fill my entire trunk up with smoke . The amp is completely fried and is unusable . Eventually I was forced to buy a new amp and completely bypass the one that was inside the tube .. which cost me another 60 bucks . Finally after countless hours of frustration and anger .. IT WORKS .. I would never recommend this brand to anyone .. this was a shoddy piece of equipment that has ZERO customer service to back it up . DO NOT BUY  
2	  Once setup is done , this remote works exactly the way it 's advertised to . Load the supplied software cd and follow the instructions , you should be ready to use your remote in about an hour . But you have to " read " all of the instructions during setup and have some patience as the setup wizard does repeat some of the questions about your equipment that you already answered . The only downside I found was that my Sharp TV ( LC-37D4U ) " cycles " to get to the needed input . This in turn took some time to get the Harmony to follow the command exactly the way I wanted it to . I had to call customer support and it even took them almost 2 hours to work everything out but they weren't giving up until they figured out the problem . Also , the number buttons are somewhat small and close together and I have average size hands , but that 's a minor detail . I will probably upgrade to the Harmony 880 or 890 remotes when I put new equipment in my living room and the prices on these remotes come down a litte more . I bought the Harmony 550 as a " tester " remote just to see if it really did everthing it claims and so far so good . For around 80 dollars I would recommend this if you are looking for a true " universal " remote .  
2	  The mouse works justs fine , but I have long fingers , so it 's not very comfortable for me .  
1	  There is a fault with the auto focus mechanism in the lens causing it to move in a very slow and jerky motion . I will have find someone to service the lens after finding out whether it is worth the trouble and cost . The lens can only be operated using the manual focus . I can't help feeling that the lens was sent to me , as a purchaser out of the US , being seen as a chance to get rid of a faulty item with no come back . It is not worth sending it back and nothing else I can do . I know buyer beware and all that stuff , but I am still very disappointed with this transaction .  
2	  My husband and I like this camera . There are lots of options for him to play with but it is simple enough for me to just grab and snap pictures without messing with settings . I didn't install the software because I had a Kodak previously and the software is a nuisance . I really like how quickly the camera adjusts to the subject and snaps the picture .  
2	  I ordered the 50 foot Gray C2G Cat6 Cable . It was shipped and sold by Amazon . I received exactly what I ordered . The cable is branded by Cables 2 Go , and performs exactly as a Cat6 cable should . Great price , compared to C2G 's website , and cheaper than price + shipping from Monoprice for the same cable . Amazon Prime made shipping much faster as well ! Just make sure you order comes from Amazon , and you should have zero problems with knock-off or incorrect cables , as others have pointed out due to ordering from other re-sellers .  
2	  Can not add much to what the other reviewer has said but I did cut the cable and added an end on it to make a custom length . I got to see the shielding up close and it is of great quality . As a HAM radio operator I 've seen the good and bad of cables of many types and I would not think twice at buying more of this cable .  
2	  I really like this bag . I was looking for a bag that can carry almost everything that I use along with the camera . This bag fits EOS 400D ( XTi ) , Tamron 17-50 ( hood reversed ) , EF 50mm 1.8 and the battery charger with cable . There are enough pockets for keeping the other accessories e.g. spare battery or additional CF cards . The bag is quite sturdy and it comes with an AW cover which I have not tried yet . Also the camera handling is really simple , with top loading , it is very easy to take the camera out and place it back later .  
2	  This ZIP250 USB is my first sojourn into the realm of external high capacity media drives . I am impressed . The installation was straightforward ; no issues , no surprises . The hot-swapping is flawless . The transfer rate is all I expected . ( .. on my new notebook . On my old desktop with an add-on USB card , there are problems . I 'm not holding that against the ZIP drive though , b / c I suspect it is the old computer 's fault . I need to check for new BIOS . But I digress .. ) Mine has worked with 100MB and 250MB ZIP disks , with no issues . Lastly , even the styling is good . I give it a 5 * success rating .  
1	  $ 860.00 for a lens HOOD ? Who are they kidding ? It 's a tube , completely manually attached with no moving parts . It 's a fancy , bottomless tin can with the Canon name on it , so people with more money than they know what to do with will be oblivious enough to pay this absurd price . For $ 860.00 I want a pretty nice lens , not a hood .  
1	  The first time I ordered this , it arrived totally scratched because the packaging had come open . I ordered a replacement , and then the same thing happened .. and I tried it on my Canon t31 kit lens that 's 18 - 55mm and it didn't fit even though I ordered the 55mm filter .  
1	  The computer is marking this a two-star item when all I indicated is one star . If no stars were possible I 'd mark that . The first day I received this radio I tried a pre-recorded cassette tape . It played all right - so after a couple of minutes I shut it off , put in a fresh tape , and tried to record a radio program . The radio played all right , but it failed to record . The tape did not advance . And it was also the last time I could produce even a hint of sound out of an old tape . Perhaps the radio thought I should be honored at sitting in on its last gasp . I was not . Yes , it 's a cheap item but I feel it should have given me at least a solid week 's performance before it lay over on its back . To return it for repairs or replacement would make the loss even greater because the shipping expenses are so high . I have ordered a new Sony from another source at considerably more expense . The new one is supposed to play CD 's as well as tapes , which is not really what I wanted - but I simply could not find another simple radio / cassette recorder . A most unpleasant experience was had by all .  
1	  Bought this with the card from the same company before reading any of the reviews posted here . After setting it up , I returned it immediately . Even in the same room , with the card directly pointed at the AP , I never , ever got a 100 % link / signal quality .. only about 50 % . What 's up with that ? I think this is the fault of the card .. not the AP , but I decided to return it anyways .  
1	  I was a latecomer to the MP3 scene but I finally gave in about a year and a half ago when I picked up the Sandisk Sansa 8gb . The thing was a headache right out of the box . The software was useless . I couldn't for the life of me get it to work without crashing or freezing my Sansa . I gave up on that and went with the drag and drop method which was much simpler and faster and , for the most part , that worked fine . However I quickly discovered that if I wanted to add videos and photos to my Sansa , I HAD to use the software . If you drag and drop videos or photos , they won't be viewable . It makes absolutely no sense , but I gave the software another shot with no luck . I finally emailed customer support and they pointed me to a download of an older version of the software and , YAY ! It worked ! And about 5 minutes later it stopped working . My Sansa started sporadically disconnecting and reconnecting , interrupting the transfer and forcing me to restart the process again . Extremely frustrating . All that said , if you can deal with the frustration , the Sansa performs FAIRLY well .. I had a handful of incidents where the unit would just freeze up for no apparent reason and the delay when deleting a file or making play lists , for example , was horrid and made the features not even worth using unless you didn't mind wasting copious amounts of time . But when it wasn't lagging or crashing , it worked fine . It was a nice , small size and fit into my pocket without being noticeable . The wheel and buttons were responsive and worked well , for the most part . Though I was constantly annoyed at the inability to easily browse through my music the way I want to . I tend to arrange my folders in such a way that I can easily find what I 'm looking for , and with the Sansa there is no option to just browse the hard drive and folder structure . It 's very limited and close-minded , considering how easy it would be to add such a feature . I now own a far superior ( and far more expensive ) Archos 5 160gb and though it 's bigger , it is a beautiful piece of electronic goodness . I 'll never buy another Sandisk media player again . Avoid !  
1	  I had a 10 year old Plantronics headset that I needed to replace . The older set was a simple no frills model , but worked flawlessly . The P251 noise canceling headset has to be one of the worst headsets ever invented . The noise canceling function makes your voice clip in and out while talking and the sound quality that your listener hears is scratchy and chopped . I would never by these again . I had though that maybe Plantronics had made a good entry level pair of noise canceling headsets , but it was not to be .  
2	  I 've had CB 's since the late 1970 's .. Cobras , Unidens , and most others . Midland does , and always has made a good product . This is no different . The handhelds are great if you are in an RV campsite looking for others , or on the road , searching for traffic info . Face it , the 1970 's are gone - and even then , power jacked skip talkers ruined a lot of ' otherwise friendly ' local chats . In the area I 'm working near Canada , I get really tired of 2000-watt skip talking power hounds out of Orlando Florida blasting so hard to talk to someone in LA , that you can't hear your neighbor a mile away . Face it , we aren't buying bad radios , we are being stomped on by illegal users like these guys . Don't think badly of the Midland 75HH . It is a good little 4-watt radio . It 's output with a ' Lil Wil ' magnet mount antenna is comparable to a Cobra 29LTD with a suitable tuned antenna . Get your SWR 1.1:1 or so on 20 , get 1 and 40 as close as you can , and you should have no problems reaching out a few miles . On a good day , you can get 3-5 miles .. and that 's all they are really designed for . Don't forget , the more sunspots , the further you can reach .. and sunspots are starting to pick up now .. Good radio .. I gave it 4-stars , because they 've never offered this handheld with a mated external magnet-mount antenna .. maybe I expect too much .. ( but you can get almost the same thing in a dash mount , and add an antenna , for the same price ) .  
1	  I bought two of these memory cards for a wedding I was shooting and when I tried the first card , it started giving me errors saying " Camera cannot display image preview " ( later found out that these files were 0MB ) after the first 30 shots . I thought it was odd and was slightly frustrated but I had other cards so I just switched it out and thought I 'd deal with it later . So , I put in another card , also a PNY , only an 8GB instead . Worked like a charm . I stayed with this card until it ran out and then I switched to me second 32GB card . This time after about 50 shots , I started to receive errors again .. this time saying " Image not stored " ! I couldn't believe that TWO cards were messed up so I used a memory card from a different camera , this time a SanDisk , and had no problem the rest of the wedding . I am so disappointed that these cards had so many problems because they were a great price and I usually have no problem using PNY . I guess I will try sticking with a different company from now on . On the upside , the Amazon frustration-free packaging was fantastic ! = o )  
1	  This printer is the worst that I have owned since 1980 . I have had Epson dot matrix , OKI Laser ( really rugged , lasted for more than 50,000 pages , three books , technical reviews , papers , etc . ) , a Canon , 2 Epsons , and then I bought the HP . It looked good in the store . It installed with a huge amount of unnecessary overhead programs . Ostensibly it is a FAX / PRINTER / COPIER / SCANNER . Oh well , to paraphrase Meatloaf - three out of four ain't bad .. It has never scanned - the feature just does not work in spite of reloading the software numerous times , checking the web for fixes , etc .. There are hundreds of complaints about this . HP 's helpline did not reply to my requests for help . It uses ink at an impressive rate ( this is not a positive comment ) . It grinds REALLY loudly at start up . It is really noisy in operation . It startles the dog . If we put a colored page on the deck to copy , and select black copy , it still copies in color . What a mess . One wag said his fix was to toss it in the trash ; this seems a bit draconian although it does fix the problem . I will just put it on a shelf to catch the dust and bring out my 10 year old Epson . Just passing on a bit of frustration , thanks for reading ..  
2	  I actually do not own a XBOX . I want a SMALL surround sound system for my living room and I don't want too many bulky electronics . I decided to for for Spherex based on many raved reviews . The satellite speakers are based on the highly-regarded Omnipolar technology developed by Mirage system . I was not disappointedOut of the box there 's MINIMAL adjustment needed - just hook up your TV 's analog output and your DVD player 's digital output to the subwoofer . There are 2 optical and one coaxial digital inputs and one analog input ( total of 4 inputs ) . No need to buy bulky receiver / amplifier . After breaking-in the satellite speakers for a few hours ( this is very important ) and then put the subwoofer in the corner of my living room ( where it should be placed ) , I fired up the system for critical listening . My first impression is that this is a SUPERB , neutral sounding system . I also have a Rotel / Vandersteen surround system in my theater room ( over 10 times the cost of the Spherex ) and I have to say the Spherex system held on its own . Its sound stage is incredibly wide and deep , especially for my small living room . The treble is smooth , not fizzy . The subwoofer is full and tight-sounding , perfectly matching the satellites . I then hook up my home theater PC to it and play my classical MP3 collection ripped at 256 kbps via the Dolby Pro-logic II mode - again superb sounding . For movies the Dolby Digital and DTS works superbly as well . The sound stage is again incredibtly wide and immersive . Try to watch the Lord of the Ring with Spherex and you will see what I mean . Now the down-side . There 's some mild static noise when no music is playing - it does not bother me at all , considering there 's nothing in this price range ( surround receiver + surround sound speakers ) that can match the Spherex ( I paid $ 380 shipped ) . Secondly , it doesn't look like audiophile product - then again it 's only $ 380 . Third , it doens't use regular speaker cables ( it use RCA plug speaker cable - go figure . ) I need more than 20 feet for my rear speakers so I have to go to Radioshack to buy longer cables . Overall I am thrilled by the sound quality of the Spherex system . Five Mirage Omnipolar speakers + a subwoofer + a receiver easly cost over $ 900 . I have not compared it to the Logitech Z-5500 system which is probably Spherex 's closed competition but it does not have the Omnipolar technology . Bottom line - anyone looking for a small surround sound speaker system and don't want bulky electronics should check the Spherex out . YOU DON'T NEED A XBOX TO ENJOY THIS SYSTEM .  
2	  XBox Live accounts used to be notorious for having their information compromised . If you use your credit card even once on an XBox Live account , you can never remove that credit card information , even if you call customer support . In the past , the database has been hacked and people lost their information . It 's pretty common to have someone just compromise your gamertag too and they are pretty much near impossible to recover after the email address has been changed . For this reason , I always buy Microsoft Points and Live subscription codes in the card format . These are even better . Within a few minutes I had an email with the code in it without any extra packaging or shipping times or even having to go down to the local gamestop . No taxes are a huge plus depending on where you live . Sure you can do the same thing through XBox Live dashboard and it automatically applies the points to your card , but this way keeps your credit card out of microsoft 's hands .  
2	  I want to watch TV when my family is asleep without disturbing them . So , I searched for headphones I coud use . However , my TV 's audio out is only optical digital . I was trying to keep this as inexpensive as possible , but never imagined that I could resolve the issue for so little . The surround sound is not even a key feature for me , I just needed headphones that would work for my TV . I thought I would have to by a cable , a unit to convert digital to analog , and something to extend my headphone cable . This product brought all that , plus more ( including surround sound ) ! I received it yesterday , two days after I ordered it . It arrived nicely just as pictured . The headphones are quite comfortable and the sound quality is excellent , better than without them because I don't have a home theatre system with surround sound . It was all easy to install and works fine . The volume adjustment on the unit works fine for me too . I did not install the battery because I knew I would always have it plugged in . It now sits atop my DVD player in my entertainment center . From the product description and the reviews I read I was not sure if I would be able to connect regular 3.5 mm stereo headphones to the unit instead of those included . Sometimes my wife and I stay up to watch tv when the kids go to bed . This would allow us both to watch without me having to buy another Cyberhome headset . I may buy one anyway , but I tried connecting regular headphones and it did work . My wife and I watched a DVD we rented last night with our regular stereo headphones just fine . However , I did notice a limitation . When I tried using regular headphones with this unit some things ( like my DVD movie ) came through fine . However , when watching regular TV I could not hear the sound on the shows on last night . I suspect it has something to do with whether the sound is being transmitted as 5.1 or 2.0 because I heard all the TV commercials perfectly . I 'll probably do a little testing and try to verify this . Either way , it is well worth the price . If you can afford it and like to watch tv with your spouse when the kids are asleep , it is probably worth it to buy two sets . I haven't had them for long , but so far so good !  
2	  This works great for the price . It is really basic and simply made , but how can you go wrong for less than $ 1 ? I needed it for my dorm room to connect my really long cord with a shorter one in order to reach my side and I didn't have any problems with it . The only thing that I was aware of was that the cords snap in a little hard sometimes but like I said , less than a $ 1 .  
2	  Excellent product , work as you expect , very fast and very handy next to your computer . I will recommended this product  
2	  We bought three of these for our apartment and they worked great . Easy to assemble and they provide a great amount of light for a room . We brought them with us when we moved into our new house and they still are great lights for any room . They look great and nobody would guess the shade was plastic unless you touch it . For the price , you can't beat it !  
1	  It was not a new genuine Cannon PG-40 cartridge as advertised . It was a refurbished refill clone . It only worked for 1 day and then the printer refused to work with it . The printer would not work until this cartridge was replaced with a real Cannon PG-40 . This refurbished refill clones are lower quality and less reliable . Don't buy them .  
1	  The mouse worked great but the keyboard was very erratic . After my efforts to make it work failed , I called customer service . They do not have a toll free number but they handle the call as if they have one : there are long lists of menus to navigate through and they put you on hold forever . When someone answered the phone , I described the problem and he immediately said that the keyboard appeared defective and I should exchange it . The conversation lasted only 30 secs . Moreover , they only work from 10am to 7 pm M-F . So , I had to come homw from work to make this call . The customer service person was nice but the whole setup is very poor and reflects badly on the company . If the person in charge of customer service at this firm reads this , then please realize that your efforts to save money by not having toll free numbers and limited working hours will be frustrating to most customers who have come to expect a better service . With the nature of products you make , a person has to be with the product when they troubleshoot and for working people , that means having to go home during working hours . On the whole , the wireless mouse was just awesome . I haven't worked with a functional version of their wireless keyboard yet .  
1	  My biggest qualm is that since I upgraded the firmware to my DI-524 at the D-Link website , I have experienced random restarts from this router . Additionally , it requires a reset everytime you make a change to its configuration . This is extremely annoying , especially having had a router that never had to do that ( LinkSys WRT54G . ) I normally used this DI-524 in case I needed wireless from the LAN in a hotel . I had to pull this router out since I hosed my LinkSys from being too inquisitive with third party firmwares . D-Link has truly shown me how much I 'm missing from my LinkSys WRT54G and so with that , I 'm going to grab another LinkSys router . Some of you may not even care about the firmware factor , but if you do like to keep your routers up to date , and you 're an advanced user , please don't buy this . Save your money and get a LinkSys .  
2	  no question about the quality but i found the same item cheaper by $ 10.00 from buy . com  
2	  The camera works very well . I like it that I can carry extra batteries and not worry about missing something . It is palm size and easy to fit in a pocket . It is so easy to plug into the computer .  
1	  I used nothing but Sony DVD-R discs for nearly six years and had no problems with them until now . The latest stack that I bought is horribly unreliable . At least 40 % of them so far have been bad , not passing data verification or playing back video with glitches even if they do pass it . I tried two different software programs and even replaced my desktop PC 's DVD burner in case it was failing , but continued to have bad luck with them . My laptop 's DVD burner software sees these discs as 8X rather than 16X like they 're rated , and the odds of them working seems to increase at burn speeds below 8X . But I 'm definitely not getting what I paid for anymore , so I 'll be switching to a new brand .  
2	  I being hard of hearing and evean with hearing aids I need the TV to loud for the comfornt of others in the room , These sloved the problem , Not only do they give me the level of sound i need they also have great clarity I can understant the dialog even with a loud back ground music in the movie , the frequency range is fabulouis , the soft cussion earpiece reduces the room noise nicely .  
1	  Tried to install on Windows xp . Product would only occassionaly read the memory card . In the end it created 4 different drive icons . Gave up and threw it away . Purchased another brand and it worked perfectly .  
1	  didnt work must of been defective , and why do you need so many words to make this work ahh  
2	  Purchased this item in order to transfer data to an external 2TB Iomega drive using eSATA . Had a couple open SATA onboard ports , so figured I could use one externally . I 'm not sure if I just overlooked the cord length or perhaps figured it would work for my setup , but 1 foot is not exactly long and it just barely made it with about an inch of slack . Had to place the card at the bottom location of slots in order to accomodate . Haven't had a chance to do a whole bunch of transfers with it just yet , but seems to work pretty well .  
1	  I can not fit my 60D in this bag unless I take all of the dividers out and place it sideways . Then , I am unable to place another lens in the bag . The 6 is too small to be truly functional for me , even though I wanted a small bag to minimize weight on my back . I 'm returning it . For the price , I 'm moving up to the 7 which is only $ 5 more and much more functional .  
2	  Just as you 'd expect to it , plug things in and you 're connected . It will be $ 15 / unit if I get the rebate back ( hopefully I do ) . I seriously question the power savings . The 44 % is if you turn the computers off . Well that 's like saying ' These lights are 50 % more efficient over other lights ' then in fine print it says ' If you only run 6 hours / day vs . 12 . The units real power savings is going to be in the 20 % , which are gains made but actually using less power 5v vs 7v of power . I 've been told it draws power from your computers so maybe there are no net gains . However , for $ 15 / unit I picked up two for our home network . They work well . After 3-4 days in use , no problems . I 'll report back if I never get the rebate .  
1	  Amazon Prime members avoid Smart digital , though from other reviews Amazon 's main site seems afflicted by the same curse . Received Cabletech Technology knockoffs ( [ .. ] ) instead of " snagless " cap Cables To Go ( [ .. ] ) - note valued at $ 28.99 on the manufacturer 's site . Furthermore , the site above suggests these knockoffs may be labeled cat 6 but are afterall tested up to 100mhz and could therefore be cat5 in sheep 's clothing .  
1	  I installed these speakers in my 2002 Honda Civic 4dr . I was thinking this would be an cheap , minor upgrade from my stock speakers and give me a better listening experience . Unfortunately these Pyle Speakers did not make any sort of an improvement . They actually sound worse than my stock paper Honda Cones ! Worse bass , slightly better mids and highs , but all around " empty " sounding . After hours of work and wiring to install the Pyles , I re-installed my stock speakers and threw these in my garage never to be touched again . Be warned , these speakers are utter crap . I wasted $ 40 on them . Do not buy for ANY reason .  
2	  Not much to say here that hasn't already been said .. outstanding quality sound for the cost ( I got these for under ten bucks ) . They feel like quality buds , but also maybe a bit delicate as well . I can't speak to the durability , but at this price , it is more than worth it . If I am going to do something that breaks these buds , then it would also probably break a more expensive pair as well . For the price , they can't be beat .  
2	  A great buy for those on the go . I use mine for business travel , it fits into a coat pocket and is always ready for exceptional pictures . Sony has hit the mark with this one . In particular , I love the macro feature . Much of my work is in communications of ideas that are rather small . I can focus on an object at 1.5 " and get a incredibly clear picture . Features are also great , from stills to movies with sound . In addition the manual view finder is great for those bright days when the LCD is harder to see . Buy you 'll love it - nothing else like it . Doug  
2	  I really like this product because I raise dogs and I can put each dog on with different colored disks and just look for the color and its easier to find instead of looking and looking through all my black floppies to find the right one . Thanks again , Karon  
1	  I just received two of these today . Upon opening the plain , grey plastic pouches , I was very disappointed to find non-Canon cartridges . In fact , the cartridges had no supplier or manufacturer information on them at all . $ 42 is rather steep for " compatible " cartridges , so back they are going . At least I had no problems with Amazon 's customer service . I am getting a full refund and prepaid return shipping . I don't know if this is just a glitch , but I would be wary of them .  
1	  I bought these over a year ago . I couldn't be more disspointed with them . Although the midrange and higher sounds ok , it 's nothing to write home about . I didn't like the fact it has almost no bass . You won't get any bass if they are not sealed in your ear , so I tried all the pad sizes and still no bass . I don't like how they stick out of your ear at all . I feel like I put the money through the paper shredder I shelled out for these .  
1	  This camera is great because of its size and ease of use . But only half of my pictures are in-focus . I have experimented with every setting and still can not get consistently clear pictures . I bought this for my upcoming honeymoon and wish desperately that I had not because I don't want any of those moments out of focus . At around $ 300 it may seem like a great deal but spend a few more dollars on a camera that gives consistent performance .  
2	  I have already fixed over 20 computers with these tools and not one has fried any components or hard drives .  
2	  This is my first experience with a HD mp3 player so I don't have a lot to compare it with . I also have a Rio Volt 250 CD mp3 player and I can say that the sound from the CHD1000 is just as good . The Music Match software that comes with the player is faster than the one you can download for free and then pay for as a plus version . I bought the plus version before I got the CHD1000 . The 6.0plus that comes with the CHD1000 will rip about 2 times faster than the 7.0 plus version now offered for download . I had to install the driver into Windows XP . The installation went smooth although the driver isn't signed and XP protested in its normal way . The driver hasn't caused any problems so far . The software lets you connect to the player via mini USB cable . You can send mp3 WMA files to the player and you can set up folders to send the music too . You cannot however upload anything from the player to your computer . This might be a feature that further models might have . Once you get your music downloaded from the computer into the player , it works beautifully . You can navigate through the folders finding the album you want and then select the song you want to hear . I wish you could do this while playing . Once you start navigating the music stops until you settle on a selection . A big plus is its ability to record from analog source . This means it has a built in AD converter . I know you can record from stereo etc . It should work using a small mixer and microphones to record live as well . All in all though I think it is well worth the money .  
2	  I bought these because of the good reputation of Taiyo Yuden . However , they are not marked Taiyo Yuden anywhere , pretty generic packaging . When tested with Nero , they did reveal a Taiyo Yuden code and they are a little thicker than other DVD-R 's and slightly rounded on the edge . I 've never had a burning error with them ( 60 discs ) and I tested a few discs after burning with Nero and they got very good marks . I compared them with the Memorex DVD-R 's I had been using and they rated about the same . Taiyo Yuden reportedly use superior dyes and have a long-life . The discs are definitely a little sturdier or thicker than most any other . The only problem I 've had with them is that my Lite-on DVR 5045 will not read any of the discs . They play fine on my Philips , LG , or the PC ( Samsung ) , but not on the DVR . Pros : Quality manufacturer brand ( Most name brands are outsourced and quality can vary ) , Sturdy , Gives good quality burns . Cons : No brand marking , Won't play on my specific DVR but does play on 3 other DVD players with no problems .  
1	  My friends commented how blurry my screen was . I never noticed it probably because he came about slowly . But after connecting my old SONY Trinitron Multiscan G400 it was a night and day difference . It could be because I had this monitor sitting between two Event 20/20 BAS studio monitor speakers , but my SONY Trinitron G400 doesn't have any problems with clarity being between those two speakers . This Viewsonic monitor has a low quality , blurry image , and is now sitting in it 's box out in my garage ready for the trash .  
1	  I bought this modem in late 2010 after my Motorola Surfboard died after 10 years . A few weeks ago , January 2012 , the modem failed . I contacted ZOOM to inquire about how to obtain in-warranty service . They answered , and explained that I need to ship it back AND pay them an extra $ 15.00 . After about three weeks , I will receive a working modem ( refurb , same , or different model ) . When I complained about the extra , unwritten cost , this is the response that I received from Zoom 's spokesman : " ( J. Phillips ) 02/14/2012 06:13 PMYou are putting the wrong implications to my comments . Cost of living has increased for everyone - regular people swell as businesses . I know that you have also expereinced how we all get a lot less for our money these days than even a year ago . Things come in smaller packages and also with increase cost . If you go grocery shopping - you will notice smaller sizes in things such as ice cream , bags of sugar , flour . Gas prices have increased dramatically . This has affected shipping on all things - all types of supplies components , boxes , paper goods - - as well as finished products to and from . This is the increased cost that the handling charges offset the most . I never said or implied " increased failures " . Your modem is more than a year old and the policy is $ 15 handling charge . This is a company policy . I do not have control over it . Your modem has a 5 year warranty and all repairs and or replacements are free , but the $ 15 handling charge is set . " So if you are willing to put up with a company that won't stand behind their products , and whines about their financial woes when you ask them to explain why they do not honor their warranty , buy this and any other ZOOM product !  
1	  As I wrote in another review of these disks , on my NEC DVD burner that is rated to do CD-RW at 24X , these disks are abyssmal . Even when I was sure to use a brand new one and not exceed 16X , the disks are good for one burn and any subsequent burns are questionable , at best . I have given up on these . They are expensive one-time use disks and certainly the most useless media I 've used since I started disk burning back in 1999 . Their quality would not be acceptable even if they were cheap ( and they are expensive ) . They are honestly not worth bothering with if free because they are frustrating . I have some old Memorex 4x disks I 've been using for a while and they have given no problem , but these are junky junk and among the worst products I 've used in my entire consumer life , including crossing the boundaries into cars , mp3 players , etc . They simply do not work and the money is thrown in the garbage to equal benefit .  
1	  Greetings to all potential Creative customers , I was greatly disturbed today when I found out the lack of help provided by the Creative Labs Company to my wife when her 30 GB Zen MP3 player failed to run properly . In my opinion , it 's actions like this that are ruining companies and our country 's economy . Due to this company 's inaction today , they have lost a once satisfied customer . Once being more than happy to promote this product , now we will be sure to divulge to our friends and relatives of this company 's lack of helpfulness . My wife asked specific questions of the technical advisors in the e-mail form which were ignored ; she was given a form letter , was referred to the website , and was told that she would be charged by the company for further help . She expressly requested the guidance of upper management from the technical support specialist , and this request was ignored , proving that Creative Labs is unwilling to provide any kind of meaningful help and does not value customer service . The menial help that the highly flawed website provided was a firmware application that caused the device to completely fail , and then the last piece of friendly advice that we received was that we should purchase a new one from the company 's website . We were given an application that made our expensive device inoperable , and for that , I will never purchase another Creative product again . We have both been faithful Creative Labs buyers for years , and my wife had multiple friends and relatives buy their products based on her recommendations . It is with deep regret that I inform all that Creative Labs customer service has proven to be a bitter disappointment and for this , they have lost my family 's business .

2	  I am a long time Canon user and have always appreciated how easy Canon camera 's worked as well as the quality of the pictures taken . I replaced my old Rebel XTi 8 MP with this one . So far so good .  
2	  Absolutely worth the price . I am at peace when at work .. Was very apprehensive before buying but now that I am using it , I have no regrets . Love this privacy screen . The name 3M says it all .  
1	  Off the top the most I can say for this camera is that I 'm glad it was a gift . I had the camera for two weeks before it would shut down with a " battery low " message even though the battery indicator showed full . I had HP replace the camera only to have the same problem with the new camera right off the bat . As for the picture quality , I have no issue there . The pictures are decently clear . The menus are easy to use as long as the camera will stay on . So overall , if this speaks for the quality of HP cameras , then I 'll find something else .  
1	  This works okay .. there is a humming noise I hear and others hear it as well and the volume is too low . Will need to replace .  
1	  My problem is that the " touch " sensitive volume controls on the little speakers gets stuck , either too loud or no sound at all . Oh yeah , you can't do anything to FIX the problem . So , Get a good deal , and then not be able to use them . Ever ask yourself WHY the price deal ? Now you know why !  
2	  This is a good little card . Don't know if there is much to rave about , but at least there is nothing to complain about . Very trustworthly card .  
1	  This is probably the fifth cartridge I have replaced and the only one not to work perfectly . This one would produce good quality single pages but incomplete printing of multi-page documents . Amazon was quick to send a replacement after I contacted them but , sent the wrong cartridge .  
2	  So far it fits the requirments I needed . The best thing is it has shopping menu which contains all kinds of stores address . Basically as long as you know the name of the store , you can go there . Also it is the same for gas station . But I have to say it 's not updated so well . Once I want to find the nearest shell station because I 'm almost ran out of oil . But the addresses is wrong , TWICE . I 'm very close to call someone towing my car that day . So if you want to go to some gas station , go online to confirm first . Other things are really good . Especially when you know the accurate address of the position you want to go . There are so many similar addresses with slight differences aroung . Like south , north , Dr , Blvd , or just different city . It 's very confusing when you just look though the paper map . The only thing you need to be careful is that don't enter the wrong name . You definitely need one .  
2	  I got this for my child as a christmas present . She loves it . Its light weight , compact and pretty good speakers .  
1	  I bought 2 cables like this . Neither one worked form day one . I got mad and went to Best buy and spent $ 30 for the same cable and now it 's working . I do not advice anyone to buy it .  
2	  I absolutely love my Archos AV700 . I used to own the Creative Portable media center , which is a huge pain compared to the archos . synching video to this player is a piece of cake and takes 1/2 the time that creative does . you can also record directly on to the device from your cable box , VCR or DVD player , which you cannot do with any of the other devices . The picture is not as good quality , but for all of the benefits , it is well worth it . The system runs like windows with folder type organization . I highly recommend this device !  
1	  I noticed that some reviewers love the product and some hate it . I wonder if Belkin has a quality control problem . My router worked for about 30 minutes though I did to have turn off security for wireless to connect . Figured I would do my own security via MAC filtering . MAC filtering worked for 10 minutes and then it died . When I called Belkin I noticed that : 1 ) This model router has an option ( # 1 ) on their technical support line ( that should tell you something ) , no other product has an option . 2 ) It took less than 10 minutes for me to establish that the products was dead with their techs but 30 minutes on hold with their returns department before I spoke to a human . As noted by other reviewers you have to pay for the shipping the dead router back to Belkin . This was an educational experience for me . Next time I 'm going with another product .  
1	  Very effective at protecting privacy . Impossible to view the screen from an angle . BUT , way too much glare .. reading the edges of the screen is nearly impossible , even looking straight on .  
1	  I used this bag for one year to carry my 13.3 " , 4.2 lb laptop ( without the charger ) and occasionally a textbook ( never more than one - there wasn't enough space ) . It served me well enough at the time . The shoulder strap was comfortable , and the separate front pocket was easy to access and large enough to hold my other stuff . The downside : one day , while walking to class , the D-shaped ring on the side broke and the shoulder strap released . Absolute disaster ! Sure , the bag is well padded , but it does nothing to protect a laptop after it plunges 3 feet onto concrete . My laptop was in bad shape : there was a hole in the casing on the corner where it had impacted the ground . Also , my wireless internet on-off switch stopped working . Unfortunately , it had gotten stuck in the " off " position . I called Targus customer service and received nothing more than a hard-to-hear ( overseas ) service rep reciting the company 's mission statement . I asked to talk to a higher-up and was denied . Later I received an email offering to replace my bag , as per the warranty . I didn't take them up on the offer , nor will I be entrusting my laptop ( back to normal now , after a $ 400 + repair ) to a Targus product . Bottom line : I can't recommend this product to anybody . Current owners , check your D-rings ; mine were separated in a very inconspicuous line .  
2	  These are excellent headphones for the most part . The bass is wonderfully rich , the mids are superbly crisp , and the highs are brilliant . They are also very comfortable . There are only a few nitpicky details I would like to comment on . First of all , when I first opened the box , I noticed that they were very large . Obviously , the picture shows that they are indeed full sized headphones , but I had been used to Sennheiser 's PMX200 street style headphones , so they seemed gigantic . Anyway , another attribute that bothered me was the length of the cord . It measures a long 5'5 feet ! These headphones are good for use around your house or things that do not require a lot of movement as it will easily get caught on objects . My final and largest gripe that I have with these is the significant amount of sound leakage . Even at quarter level volume , others around you would be able to hear the music ( of course , this all depends on the sound level in the place you are listening in ) . Besides these few EXTREMELY small issues , these headphones are great for your money and worth the problems .  
1	  Spend your money on a worthwhile battery - I 'm all for buying generic , but my Canon-made battery 's still going strong after two years , whereas the Power2000-made battery conked out very quickly and now won't hold a charge at all ..  
2	  This helped my older PC a lot ! I should 've bought this upgrade a couple of years ago !  
1	  Can't recommend this one . I bought one on a lark , not expecting anything but a conversation piece . It lasted about 4 hours before dying . It heated up to the point the case melted in one spot . The plastic stress relief on the USB plug end also discolored , apparently from heat on that end as well . Oh , well . Cute idea . Poor implementation or quality control .  
2	  I got this thing without knowing if it would fit in my 92 civic or not , but I 'm glad it did . The reason I got this was so that I could put in my new stereo system . Unfortunately , the previous owner had wired the aftermarket head unit directly to the wires in the car ( in other words , there was NO harness or reverse harness . ) So after separating the wires and attaching this reverse harness to the car 's wires , I was able to do a clean install of my new head unit . I was also super stoked at how cheap this part is compared to the dealerships that I asked around at .  
1	  As with many others that have reviewed this camera it sucks batteries and doesn't take great pictures . To get decent images from this camera you must have the resolution and compression set at the highest quality memory robbing setting ( 41 images on a 64 MB card ) . Mine zapped a set of 2000 mAh NI-MH before even filling my 64 MB card . I got this camera used and called Gateway about having work done on the camera due to a focus problem and I was informed that they don't even work on out of warranty products . I ended up buying a Fuji FinePix 2650and it can take better pictures than the gateway , and the Fuji is only 2MP . In the Gateway 's defense , it does have a lot of manual controls , which mean nothing to me . I recommend that anyone looking at digital cameras go for a brand that is well known for cameras , such as Kodak , Olympus . Also keep in mind that you get what you pay for .  
1	  I purchased this product on the advice of a tech support person at Netgear as a second replacement for one of thier units . It turns out it is incompatible with my other Netgear unit . After over 45 days of trying to work it out with Netgear , ( which included being hung up on twice , lied to , and given the wrong phone numbers twice ) I have become completely frustrated and returned the unit back to Amazon . I can not honestly tell you if this unit functions as promised or not , or if this unit outlives the 1-2 year lifespan the other two units had . I can tell you that thier 24/7 tech support is as frustrating an experience as I have ever had with a company . Buyer beware .  
2	  True - There are other headphones out there , however they will be more pricey . These are the best results I have had with earbud style headphones . The Loop and different sized rubber pieces helped me to achieve the perfect fit . Im so happy I can finally get them to stay on ! Oh .. and by the way the sound is good also ! Im very satisfied with the product because I feel that I have gotten my money 's worth .  
2	  This combo works pretty much as advertised to copy VHS tapes onto DVD 's of various formats . It isn't completely intuitive to operate , so , horror of horrors , you actually need to read the directions to operate it . The directions assume a level of competence I don't possess , so I 'm still trying to figure out how to split titles and edit , but that will come with some experiementing .  
1	  Quality for dark photos and shadows is poor . Dark areas come out with uneven / banded colors . It seems like the severity of the problem changes with where you place the photo on the scanner . The best area I 've found is at the top of the bed near the lid hinges . I 'm going to exchange mine to see if it is a problem with my specific unit .  
2	  In general this works very well . The maps in my area ( middle of nowhere KY ) look like they were created from current and planned roads from 1980 . Any road less than 10 years old is not included and many never built roads are included . Pros : 1 ) Signal aquirement is very fast . 2 ) Re-routing is very fast . 3 ) Audible directions are good . 4 ) Display is excellent . Cons : 1 ) Maps only come in regions of 1/2 - 4 states ( about 35 Mb each ) and can not be broken up . Therefore the 64 Mb of data storage can not be efficiently used ( you can generally only fit 1 region on the unit at a time ) . If you live on the edge of a region then you may find yourself forced to purchase a SD media card for programming . 2 ) There are no base maps ( Interstates or Highways ) . If a region is not loaded then there are no roads ! 3 ) You can not store a " point " . You can store a street to a range of addresses . It claims I have reached my destination 2/3rds of a block before I get home . 4 ) It will instruct you to " bear right " when the road you are on goes from 2 lanes to 4 lanes . When there happens to be an intersection there it is easy to make a mistake . 5 ) It does not report elevation . 6 ) You can only select one piece of optional information on the screen ( Direction N NW W SW .. , Speed , Distance to Destination , Time , ETA , Distance to turn ) 7 ) If you don't have a specific destination programmed then the display is limited to North up display . You also lose the option to select any of the optional information . 8) No batteries - this could be a handheld but only if you want to build your own battery case . This is not as big of a deal when you consider that it does not appear that it is designed to work when you get off of a recognized street . Overall I like this . Investing in a 256 Mb SD card seems wise if not even a necessity . I have hopes that some of the CONS will be addressed through upgrades someday ..  
1	  I ordered this product 1 month back , but haven't received it yet ! And they say it won't be shipped for another 2-3 weeks ! The whole mail-in-rebate is a fiasco to trap poor customer , because you will never receive the product before the mail-in-rebate offer expires !  
1	  An inferior product , period . Cheap pastic flip-lid that is loose , about 1 " play after only 1 day of use . The LED 's that supposedly find your hotspots don't . They flash real neat like , but display no meaningful information . Just all flash together . The software clobbered my wire-line conneciton on XP . The unit did manage to find some rogue access points here and there , but there were no diagnostics like encryption type used , etc . When I managed to get it connected to an AP sitting right next to me , it gave moderate performance . It 's going back . Looked good on paper ..  
1	  I purchased the Transend 8GB SDHC Card in the beginning of August . I put it in my digital camera and it seemed to be OK . I didn't need to use the camera until the end of September and when I turn on the camera , I get a card error . Reformatting does not help and since it is past the Amazon 30 day return period , it turns into a throw away . Moral , if you have money to throw away then buy this memory chip from Amazon .  
1	  I have been looking for a long time for a record player to play my old 78 rpm records . This one CLAIMS that it can play them , and indeed it has a 45 , 33 and 78 rpm speed control , HOWEVER , it does NOT come with a 78 stylus , only one for 45 and 33 rpm records . 78 records had a much wider groove than the 45 and 33 records , and old record players similar to this one in the past usually had a stylus that could be flipped over with a lever to play different types of records . This unit has a stylus that is removable from the cartridge , but they do not include a 78 stylus , in fact , in the instruction manual , you can order replacements , but they only have the ONE type . I would not recomend playing any 78s with the tiny microgroove stylus that it comes with . Not sure if some aftermarket 78 stylus would fit this cartridge , or if the cartridge is replacable with another type . If you are only going to be using it for 33 or 45 rpm records , then this might not be a bad unit . It seems a bit more sturdy and not as " cheaply made " as some other brands that have tried to make reproduction record players of this type . This is obviously not an audiophile player , but the sound from the built in speakers was not too bad with a 33 rpm record I heard played on it . Too bad they made such a big mistake with not including a stylus capable of playing 78 's .  
1	  Great specs , but poor implementation . The digital zoom is terribly slow , and you won't want to use it anyway due to the poor quality pictures it produces . The 4 AA batteries make the camera fairly heavy , but it still feels cheaply made and bulky . The viewfinder is a bit too small for my taste . I bought one and immediately returned it after a couple of hours of testing it out . It just wasn't the camera for me .  
2	  I was a little hesitant to purchase this AC adapter because the description did not give any of the specifications . The manual that came with our Olympus D-490 camera warns that we cannot use the Olympus 3 amp adapter , so I was hesitant to order this one without knowing more . I took a chance since this was the only one I could find on Amazon , and luckily this was the one needed . The specs , for those who need to know are as follows : Class 2 power supply with Input - AC120V 50/60Hz 0.3A and Output - DC6.5V 2A  
1	  I bought this at Best Buy and I will be returning it today . I set everything up like it said , I put my dvds in .. and then the whole thing fell apart . Of course this was after I alphabetized everything . I have built a ton of stuff , mostly from Ikea , so I 'm not a complete idiot . This is not worth the money .  
2	  How much can you say about a cable ? This one is well made , the snagless ends are pretty , well , snagless . When we hooked it up it just worked . Everything one would expect from this cable .  
1	  I bought one . It died over the space of a few days . I replaced it w / another . It wouldn't even turn on . HP tech support cannot deal w / a hardware problem ( the machine could be spitting flames out the air vents and they 'd tell you to reinstall XP ) . Their checklist for every problem says reinstall first . The first thing you do for that is reformat the hard drive . That 's 3 hours w / this sytem . You have to hang up and call back when it 's done . This gives you a new tech support person , who talks you thru the reinstall from that point . If you 're having a hardware problem , the reinstall probably fails . They look up your new problem . The checklist says to reinstall . The first step is to reformat the hard drive , so call them back in 3 hours . Rince and repeat . I replaced it w / another brand that is working fine . HP sucks . One star is generous , but it 's the lowest I could go .  
2	  Bought this for Installation in a freinds 1994 Dodge Dakota , Worked Great , Very , Very Sturdy Heavy weight Molded plastic , molded in One Piece . Fit was perfect . Another Great Purchase !  
2	  The capture card itself it 's that bad . It does the job . The problem is the bundled softwares that come with it . They are a little buggy even if you are using the lastest versions . It 's best to find your own video editing programs . You can use theirs but you may get errors every once in awhile . I 'm using XP by the way . I 've also noticed that the driver can get corrupted after awhile . What will happen is the video will get very pixelated . To fix it all I did was reinstall the driver . It 's a good idea to get the lastest drivers from their website if you are having problems . All in all , I would get this card again . It 's a good deal for the price and you don't have to fill up your AGP slot like some of the all in one cards . This way you can get the best graphics card for your AGP slot and leave the video capture to a dedicated card . I still don't like the buggy software but the average user probably won't notice many problems . If you do a lot of video editing then I would recommend finding better software . The card itself is worth the money .  
2	  i have this amp hooked up to four pyramid hyper pro subwoofers , 2 12s and 2 10s , and boy does this thing slam , i only had the volume on 12 and the rear view mirror was shaking like crazy ! i would reccomend this product to anyone ! KEEP IT UP PYRAMID !  
2	  Good high , Good bass , good sound in general . Great guarantee , great price . Good for listening without blocking ambient sounds , like for jogging .  
2	  I had an older KaBoom box , the first generation . It had a hard life and I replaced it with this one . I was very happy to see the KaBoom box on Amazon . The RV-NB1 is an awesome piece of equipment . You can add other sources through the connections , but I am totally happy with everything the way it comes out of the box . The MP3 capability ( off of a CD ) is one of the main features I looked for in this type of boom box . The sound quality is super ! A little pricey , but you truly get what you pay for .  
1	  The Good : Small , lightweight , inexpensivedecent soundThe Bad : The battery life on this thing is awful . In under two hours the thing is completey drained . This is made worse by the fact thateven when it 's " off " it still has an active display , furtherdraining the single AA batteryInterface is not intuitive ( then again what do you expect for something this small ) Headphones . Simply put , they stink . Those people with large ears may find them perfect though . Memory size is limited , and not upgradeable . Conclusion : The mini-yepp is an expensive , decent piece of equipment . Howeverit 's not worth the money . Its performance does not meet the specifications that are outlined in the product description and Iwould advise anyone looking for an mp3 player to avoid this modelunless they have money to burn .  
1	  Trust me it does not work . I have tried it on all rooms , anddoes not transmit . Waste of money . If you want an item that does work I have found the SBC wireless to be the best and you can buy it at amazon or walmart .  
1	  I have been using the Delorme stuff for a few years with great sucess until i purchased a new earthmate in October 99 . ( to replace the one i gave to a friend ) The 2nd generation earthmate has embossed information on the underside rather than a black tag . DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS PRODUCT ! It does not work and Delorme is unable or unwilling to do any thing about it ! The only sugestion was " return it and buy a better quality gps receiver " This system is running on a 450 mgz toshiba laptop installed in a Limousine .  
1	  The Sunpak and Vanguard mini tripods look alike in photos , but in practice they are quite different . The Sunpak legs are hard to straighten out , as they seem to develop a " memory " of being bent . The Vanguard legs are a much higher quality material that you can bend easily and then easily straighten out . Much more satisfying .  
2	  I use these all the time . I wear hearing aids and have to have the TV louder than my husband likes it . With these I can hear better . You do have to have the sound on the TV at a certain level to get reception . I have a Sony TV and can go to the audio menu and turn the TV speakers off and then no one hears it but me through my headphones . The only problem I have with them is that they go through batteries pretty fast .  
2	  I have setup countless wireless routers since I started working it I.T. over 10 years ago . This purchase is the 3rd wireless router I buy for a client and it works flawlessly . The range is excellent , the speed is superb and the advanced features are an administrator 's dream . If you have had problems with other brands like I have and are in the need of a really good router then look no further . Omar I.  
2	  Used this as soon as I recieved it & am very happy with it . Was plug N play on my laptop but it does come with software .  
2	  I buy this audio-video player for my bro but i 'm seriously thinking buying one for myself . OK it is not an I pod but the sound quality is excelent , good bass and the earphones are decent , the only flaw is the time that takes a movie to be compressed with the software , but who wants to watch an entirely movie in small secreen , im not for it . Good price if you are not rich or I POD-MAC - fanatic .  
1	  Performance is outstanding as advertised and noted above ; when the unit works . This comment is based on years of owning multiple BEL detectors . BEL dropped the ball on this one . I have been upgrading to top of the line BEL 's for quite a few years with no problems whatsoever . Yesterday , my Pro RX65 malfunctioned for the third time in the 1 year warranty period . A 10-15 day turnaround for repair , for the third time is unacceptable . I would not recommend this unit based on poor reliability . This is the last BEL , I will ever buy .  
2	  I purchased these speakers , it came in a white box and the speakers , that 's all . I plugged it into the USB and my computer 's audio output . I listen to music / youtube / hulu .. What I like about this is : - cheap-USB Powered-volume DIAL ( not a button ) -a headphone output if I ever wantedWhat I dislike about this : - nothing so farI understand that a lot of people get the static , but it will affect any speakers , there is static when I put my blackberry ( the BlackBerry interference is so much that it gives my landline phones static ! ) UPDATE ON SEPTEMBER 7 , 2011 - MORE THAN 2 YEARS LATERFinally one of the speakers stops working , I have decided to purchase new ones . I think it is because I constantly drop them and pick them up by fishing them in with their thin wires : PIdeally , I 'd like to purchase new Bluetooth / wireless ones this time , but after so many search , I think Bluetooth is still too expensive for me , so I might just buy another pair-or a speaker bar .  
2	  I think that this is a very good device . It preforms great at all of its advertized functions . Its screen is amazing . at 3.5 inches you and up to two other people can watch at the same time . At the moment i have 20 hours of video on it and 4 gigabytes of music and it still has about 2 more gigabytes of memory left . The battery life is prett good . I get about 10 hours with music and about 4 hours with video . I get about 6-8 hours wiht mixed useThere are only a few things that i can find thats wrong wiht it , One that you cannot transfer dvds over to the archos wiht your computer . Also it is sometimes slow to open files . This is normal though for a device with this many features . All in all i think this is a very good device . It has all the features a person into media and photography would want , including a compact flash slot which comes in handy alot , but this device does have its short commings . If you want the newest stuff i would opt for the new Av500 series .  
1	  First , I would like to thank the reviewer who stated his work-around for an invalid code . I also received this error when inputting my code directly into the console . The trick is to redeem this code on your PC via your XBOX live account on xbox . com . It shouldn't be this hard , perhaps the code needed more time to become valid on the console-side , but without this helpful review I would have been stuck waiting . The code does take a long time to generate on Amazon . I have a very fast broadband connection and was surprised it took a few minutes to do it 's thing . I can see how someone with a slower connection might have given up assuming an error had occurred . I think I will be purchasing a physical card from Amazon or utilizing the xbox . com marketplace from this point forward .  
1	  Hello , I am writing this to everyone , to tell you not to buy this product . I bought it to back up my memory cards & free up some space , and ending up losing it ALL ! I have one card , that can no longer be used because of the corrupted files , which can't be deleted . And the other card , is now completely blank . I am telling you , from experience , don't buy this product .. You 'll be as mad as I am now . P.S. - And all this happened within 3 minutes of using this product . My MR3 Files & VS Data , are all gone ..  
2	  All you need to know is that there is an international mode that allows this device to operate in completely empty frequencies in the 80s . To accomplish this , hold down the " preset " button until the US mode flashes . Change it to international . Then go down to 87.7 or 87.9 and enjoy a clear band . If you have the problem of the international mode power saving bug ( the device shuts off automatically after one minute , no matter what volume you set your audio device to ) , just save the low frequencies to the memory , then switch back to US mode . Your transmitter will say that you are at 107.9FM , but it 's actually at 87.7 or 87.9 , and the power saving bug is not an issue .  
2	  The Palm Tungsten E2 will fit in this hardcase , although it is about a quarter inch short on the bottom . Other than that , it is a perfect fit and all the cutouts are accurate . The only knock on this product is that since it came from a third party , it took an additional 10 days longer than normal for an Amazon delivery .  
1	  Received on Christmas morning , open blister pack , attach small camera and try to adjust . The part that holds the camera broke off from the legs . Waste of money since I 'll have to pay for shipping , and they recommend insurance , to get it repaired / replaced .  
1	  At this point in time , DVD recorders are rarely priced below $ 100 . I received this one for Chistmas - my husband bought it and when I saw the unfamiliar brand name I had a skeptical gut feeling . We tested it by recording about five minutes of a TV show and it worked fine , then we set it to do a timed recording later that night and though the digital readout indicated it was " recording " , the disc was unplayable , even in our Sony DVD player . Tonight I attempted to do an on-the-spot recording of a two-hour program and once again the digital readout indicated the machine was " recording . " Once again the disc was unreadable . What 's worse - and very frustrating - is the onscreen commands were very confusing and the basic operation wasn't very user friendly . And the remote - what 's the deal with that ? I 'd have to point it at exactly the right spot for it to work . I 'd have better luck with it right next to the recorder . Tomorrow is the last day for me to return it according to my receipt - I 'm just narrowly making the deadline ! In my opinion it 's better to pay a little more for a trusted brand - at least do a bit of research on consumer / expert product reviews . Avoid this product !  
1	  The issue with the ipod they sent me was it DIDN'T work , it wouldn't even turn on . I charged it overnight and plugged it into my computer but nothing happened . Very Disappointing , I wouldn't suggest buying from them .  
1	  the left side stopped working within 3 months of purchase . terrible for the brand , i have a regular not in ear pair that i 've had for years that is still works . the rubber padding is bad so i thought i would replace them with this set and i was extremely disappointed that one side went bad so quickly . I have a pair of j-buds in ear that i 've had for over 2 years and they work like a charm , they 're not noise cancelling but you can't beat the quality of sound for the price . Save your money , don't buy these .  
1	  It was just the right size for what I needed , but when it was delivered , one of the corner posts , which are shipped in two pieces per leg , wouldn't assemble because where they screw together there was no interior thread , so it was impossible to get the thing assembled . I 'm still miffed that I had to pony up 16 dollars ' shipping for a defective product , but at least I got my refund .  
1	  Do NOT buy this drive . Western Digital My Book is unreliable . I 've had two of these drives , and they both died after a few months of very light use . In both cases , the drive suddenly started making the infamous clicking sound of death , and all the data was lost .  
1	  This is the worst headphone I have ever bought . It 's actually quite sad . The sound is great . Problem is - on your ears , the little ' phones stick <i & gt ; away < / i & gt ; from your ears . So there is : - NO MUSIC THAT U HEAR - NO ISOLATION - LOTS OF AMBIENT NOISE - NOT HIGHLY EFFICIENTAll in all , great headphones that refuse to let u listen . QUITE ANNOYING . And I shelled out $ 10 for these . Oh , well .. IF YOU HAVE A HUGE HEAD - the problem of the speakers jumpin away from your ears at an akward angle is non-existent . My sister uses these phones , and she loves em . If you 're like me , and have an average-sized head , or have an average-to-small sized head without any hair hanging down , these probably won't fit on you very well .  
1	  As many people already pointed out - this card is a marketing fraud . It is not X-Fi per se . Other issues : 1 . Creative site is painfully slow to download anything . All their software bundles in packages 30-60Mb and they provide the download speed around 100k / sec ( I have 25Mbit / sec connection ) . 2 . Creative drivers / software is written by a student . Horrible user interfaces , look and feel come from 90s . Some inexplicable error messages . 3 . If you plan to use Microphone with this card - BE PREPARED FOR BATTLE . If you plug your Mic into the card - it will be recognized as " Line In " , not " Mic " . Therefore - it is not going to work . You will need to download some special ( ! ) version of Creative Console to switch " Line In " to " Mic " . Enjoy the product .  
2	  My experience with LENMAR batteries has been excellent . One of the most reliable , trouble free , long lasting batteries I have ever owned . Shot pics across Europe and Southeast Asia - never a problem . Shot hundreds of pics all day long for several weeks . Just recharge the battery again and it 's good to go next morning . I own 2 Lenmar batteries : one for the Lumix FZ35 and another for my Canon Elph SD600 . Love them as much as the great price .  
1	  I liked many features of this bag but there were signs of excessive wear on certain parts after three months of use . In particular , the part that was damaged was where the metal end of the strap rubs against the edge of the bag on both sides when you actually wear it on your shoulder .  
2	  My Ipod nano has survived several drops thanks to this great little ToughSkin ! Pluses : the screen and body are well-protected while the navigation ring is free for use . Minus : the belt clip was't very reliable and made it more cumbersome . I just took it off and was very happy with the toughskin !  
2	  I bought this filter to protect the lens on my Canon 17-40mm . I 've taken over 3000 pictures with this filter on and did not notice any problems that were caused by the filter . The packaging could have been better and some dust and other debris was on the filter when I first got it , but that all came off when I cleaned it . Would recommend to those who just want to protect their lens .  
1	  I'va had two of these modems with a 3Mbits DSL line , they both had the same problem : They work fine for about 3 weeks , and then blam , they just limit my bandwidth to ~ 128k , I have to unplug it , wait a little and then replug it .. At the begining I had to do that every 2/3 days , but now it 's about every hour ! If you have to buy a modem , buy alcatel modems !  
2	  I 've got a setup that requires using a trackball ; there 's simply not enough space for effective use of a mouse . When I tried to use it with a KVM ( keyboard-video-mouse ) switch so I could work on two computers at the same time , I found that my trackball had too many features for the KVM to accept and was forced to set up a separate pointing device . The Kensington Orbit Optical Trackball Mouse was a good replacement . It is compatible with the KVM switch ( as a matter of fact , I tried it with several different switches ) and the ball moves smoothly . My only objection is that it is really designed for people with large hands . Fortunately , mine are .. I can span 10 keys on a piano . My wife , however , is unable to maneuver the ball and use the " mouse " buttons comfortably . Aside from that , however , this is a good solution to my technical problem .  
2	  I have used this product and am amused with the picture quality . The controls are very easy . Does not take up any space , just put it on the monitor , The remote is very powerful , would work from any point and position .  
2	  Product just as described at a good price with very fast shipping . I highly recommend this item . I will return for future purchases .  
2	  Well we began with a very long chat about school and girls and all the roomers . Then it gets better . We start to play the coolest games that me and him downloaded . It was great . I won all of the games of course . After we played all of the games we e-mailed everyone about the amazing things we did with our cibikos . We had a great time .  
2	  I rushed into buying this because I saw an offer of free Parallells and a free carry case , I 'm glad that I bought it . I discoverd how well iMovie works with my Digital Camcorder and now I have plenty of time to practice using them together . The only significant problem I have is using a trackpad instead of a mouse but that 's a laptop , not a macintosh , problem .  
2	  I bought this RipFlash primarily for voice recording , including memos to myself while driving . What I like about the RipFlash : 1 ) Since receiving the unit about 6 months ago I find myself using it for * SO * many things I never thought it would be good for . For example : The " Line In " allows you to capture sound from ANY audio / video or audio-only source . Big deal , right ? Well I happen to subscribe to an Internet real estate service that hosts ALL of the author 's lectures in streaming media format . Very inconvenient if you don't want to sit in front of the computer for 40 + hours to listen to all the tapes . Enter the PoGo . I unplugged my PC 's speakers , plugged in the PoGo ( it comes with a Line-In patch cord ) into the back of my PC , pressed the " Record " button on the PoGo , clicked the audio file I wanted to capture , then walked away for 1/2 an hour . After downloading several hour 's worth ( since it is voice-only capture I picked a lower quality level , which uses less memory ) I transferred the files from the PoGo to the PC as MP3 files , then burned the real estate lectures onto several audio CDs . Now I can listen any time - anywhere - to what originally forced me to sit in front of my computer for hours ! That 's just one example of an innovative use for this product . There are literally dozens of useful applications - I think of a new one every few weeks ! 2 ) Software for the PC is good , easy to use , and uploads / downloads are pretty darn fast using the provided USB cable . Now for the things I don't like : 1 ) Battery life . Uses 2 standard Alkaline batteries . They last about 10 hours . I found the " Ultra " batteries go about 50 % longer , but they cost more . There is no way to plug in an external power supply . 2 ) Documentation is poor . REALLY poor . There are actually CUT OUT pieces of paper with new print on them covering the old print in the manual ! 3 ) Menu doesn't work well for deleting specific files . Since this base model doesn't identify songs / entries by title , you only get to reference entries by number . The numbers change ( re-number again ) as you delete entries . I 've found the best way around this is to use the PC software that comes with the unit . 4 ) No back-lighting for the display . Hard to view in low-light conditions . ( Number 3 and Number 4 are addressed in the RipFlash Plus - spend the few extra bucks - it 's worth it ! ) 5 ) Ear bud headphones sound great , but you gotta have BIG ear holes to have them fit comfortably . I can't go longer than 1/2 an hour before it hurts . I 'm very happy with my RipFlash over-all , but I 'd recommend spending the few extra bucks to get one of the more expensive RipFlash models of this product line .  
2	  Always have had good luck with these disks . They seem to work very well with Vista or Windows 7 Blu Ray or regular burns . A good value .  
1	  Cameras have narrow view . Camera 1 ( channel 1 ) is the most powerful with camera 4 ( channel 4 ) only functioning within 10 feet of receiver . IR night view is provided by LEDs which only weakly illuminate a 4 foot circle up to about 15 feet . To monitor an area in the dark or near dark it does not do the job .  
1	  After purchasing 3 different PDA 's before I found one I liked , I decided that Palm series PDA 's were not worth the money . The clincher for Palm for years now has been that they have a lot more software available for their Palm operating system . This is , rather , a very ridiculous argument considering that unless you want 15 different card games or an inefficient money management program , than purchasing a Palm OS PDA is ridiculous . Palm OS PDA 's come with slower processors , the good programs must be downloaded to be used , and features like 801.11x wireless capabilities are only available in high-end models . ( Okay , some come with cameras that have worse resolution than my $ 15 web cam ) The software that is installed on them operates well , but does not have as user-friendly of a interface as MS Windows Mobile 200x ( especially sense most people are accustomed to Microsoft software already ) . It is true that MS Windows Moble 200x / Tablet PC Edition have fewer programs available , but the ones that are available are a lot more efficient and user friendly . The good programs for this operating system are already installed such as : MS Pocket Word , MS Pocket Excel , MS Messenging ( like outlook ) , File Explorer , Picture viewer , and Windows Media Player . These programs are also a WHOLE LOT easier to synchronize and use with other MS desktop applications ( for obvious reasons ) . Other cool and useful programs can be downloaded for free or a small charge like : Adobe Acrobat , Powerpoint Viewer , and AOL Instant Messenger . Bottom Line : You can buy a Pocket PC for around $ 250 or so that often has wireless , a digital voice recorder , and an INCREDIBLY easier sync system with other MS applications . If you like paying the same for a crappy 320x320 camera and having to settle for programs that often have to be downloaded or purchased to sync with basic MS products ( if you can figure out how to download them at all ) and have no wireless capability then PalmOne is for you . Otherwise BUY POCKET PC !  
2	  It was my first experience ordering on line . It was very user friendly and I received my order in a timely manner .  
2	  I clean a lot of windows so I 'm pretty picky about what I use , and I 've found Windex to be the best glass cleaner around . It gets most everything off ( grease , caked on stuff , fingerprints , etc ) , doesn't streak , and is inexpensive . What more could you ask for ? Sometimes I even use it for other general kitchen and bathroom cleaning when I 'm in a pinch . ( Hey , it works ! )  
1	  I agree with one of the other more recent reviews . Overall , I have been extremely pleased with my Kensington products . They work well with my multiple Macs and also Windows-based PCs . I bought an earlier version of this desktop wireless set ( K64382 ) , which worked well for about two years and then began to malfunction - primarily a few keys that either wouldn't function or only every now and then . I contacted Kensington , and they informed me that they didn't have that set , which I 'd purchased via Amazon ( where I buy nearly all of my electronics and plenty of other products ) . However , under their five-year warranty , they told me that they 'd send me a new set , i.e. , this one ( K64390US ) . It 's fantastic . I couldn't even use the other one where I wanted to use it , which was with my Mac Mini that 's connected to our plasma TV in our bedroom ( reception wasn't very good , which resulted in using it directly in front of my iMac ) . With the new set , it works perfectly with my Mac Mini setup , allowing me to use the wireless keyboard and mouse about ten feet away . I 've experienced no issues whatsoever with the new set , which seems even more responsive as well . I would definitely recommend it as well as the Kesington brand due to my support experience . Sept . 8 , 2011 : This is an update to my original May 3 , 2010 review ( awarded 4 stars at that time ) . This newer set worked well until recently . Then it completely stopped working . It seems like a software issue . However , when I contacted Kensington , they informed me that they haven't updated and don't plan to update this MouseWorks-type software . I 've purchased several Kensington products for Mac over the years , but don't plan to purchase anything else in the future . Logitech seems to have some of the best Mac-oriented keyboards and mice . I 'm disappointed in Kensington 's apparent decision . Their newer iPad keyboard has received good reviews , but I 'd approach with caution based on my experiences with these full-sized desktop sets .  
1	  I bought this camera back in December 2004 just before going on a trip to Europe , at the time it was the " bee 's knees " in camcorders . It was the most amazing little gadget I had owned at the time , and I was thrilled with the results . I 'm still very happy with the results , but there are quite a few issues with it . Firstly , you can't do anything with the video you 've shot - even getting clips onto your PC is a chore . Sometimes the computer finds the camera , more often it doesn't . I 've now given up getting anything onto the PC , and I just watch the video on the TV unedited . The software that comes with it is completely useless . All you can do is stitch together different clips in their entirety . I managed to do this ONCE in 2 years , but never got the software to burn a DVD of what I had stitched together - the software crashed the computer every time I tried to do it , so I gave up trying . Secondly , like so many other people , disc errors pop up every once in a while . I admit I have been lucky with it , and have only had a couple , but then again , I haven't used this camera much in all that time , and you just don't know when its going to happen . ( I had a disc error when I put a new SONY DVD into the camera in St Petersburg , Russia . I didn't have another DVD with me , so I have no video of St Petersburg at all . ) Lastly , finalising a disc is a nightmare . You spend 10 or 15 mins chewing your nails to the quick waiting for the camera to start beeping and flashing ' DISC ERROR ' at you , thus loosing everything you 've shot . Again , this has only happened to me a handful of times , but it happens right at the moment when you don't want it to happen . I lost the whole of the west of Ireland because of a disc error during finalising - once again , a SONY disc . Its not as if you can just put another disc in and go back to Ireland to reshoot it all . The 3 or 4 other times its happened was close to home , when I just did go back and reshoot it another day . But what if it had been something important , like the birth of a child or a wedding , like other reviewers have had ? After reading so many horror stories about this camera , I can say I 'm one of the lucky few . My camera has only done the dirty on me a couple of times , but then again , every time I use it , I think to myself , ' Is this the time its gonna stuff up ? ' Which is a real pity , because on the whole its been a nice little camera , and has traveled with me to a lot of places , and has generally been great . But .. you just never know when the moment will come . Using Sony discs wont solve the disc error problem . I 've only ever used Sony brand discs , and they also give errors when the camera feels like it . And the camera hates DVD + R discs - I wasted money on a whole packet of these , only to have every one of them get a DISC ERROR from the camera when I first put them in . Obviously it only likes DVD-R discs . I would say , save your nerves and don't buy any DVD camcorder , no matter what the brand . They 're far too temperamental and the technology too dodgy .  
1	  These little earphones have nice sound and are comfortable to wear , but they last one year at the most . If you buy them for their good price , go ahead and buy the replacements now .  
2	  This is a solid joystick . It is inexpensive , which bumps it up by at least one star . If you just want a joystick for flying and aren't super into flight simulators ( or think you might get into them , but aren't sure ) , this is a good purchase .  
2	  I 'm using it right now actually . It has a great feel in your hand , the extra buttons are all in great locations . I think it 's one of the best mice I 've ever used . I like the texture of it too , kinda rubberized . Works well .  
2	  Sony doesn't exactly develop the newest technology , but nobodyhas better designers and nobody can refine an idea like Sony . The SJ33 is the case in point today : I 'm a former Handspring Visor owner , when it was the first PDA to come in colors and the first to come with 8 Megs and an advanced version of the Palm OS . It was cutting-edge then .. and the SJ33 , while not cutting-edge any longer , will fill the bill for former Handspring Visor owners and newcomers alike . First , the display is color , 65k colors worth and bright as all heck . You want to keep a virtual picture frame on your desk , this is a nifty 320x320 screen for displaying hundreds of wallet-sized photos . Second , MP3s out of the box . Sure , no Memory Stick is included , and you are limited to 128 Meg Sticks at that ( the new 256 Sticks are merely double-sided 128s ) , but you score a few Sticks , and you 've got nearly as much MP3 space as a CD . And because it 's solid state memory , no shock , no skip , just pure sound . Third , it comes with the best software bundle of any PDA today . In fact , all Sony handhelds come with superior bundles : Documents to Go lets you view * and * edit Word and Excel documents ; Intellisync is the best sync software for Outlook users , bar none ; the games are terrific , but Bejeweled is possibly the most addictive game since Tetris ; and the utilities for viewing and managing music , photos , and movies ( yep , movies too ) are far beyond my expectations . Fourth , it 's a Lithium-Ion battery , so you charge it whenever you 're not using it , and just go . It lasts awhile , not nearly 9 hours if you 're playing Bejeweled constantly or listening to MP3s , but you can go a whole day easy . Fifth , those flip cases come in colors . I 'm sorry , but a little funk in your PDA is a must . I dig colors , and I 'm gonna score me that excellent orange one soon . Now , the bits that kept a fifth star from alignment in the Clie Constellation :# 1 The SJ33 doesn't support Memory Stick Pro , so if you think you want 256 , 512 , or even 1 Gb Memory Stick space , you have to go a different route , like the NZ series or T series Clies . # 2 : MP3 encoding from bundled software is limited to 128kps , 44Hz encoding . If you like 192 or even 256k encoding , you need 3rd party software . Good news is I can play my 192 or 256-bit MP3s with no problems . # 3 : The Jog Dial is very cool , but a bit small and stiff . You need some serious dexterity to properly use it while holding the unit ( heh , I said " unit " ) . # 4 : Palm OS 4.1 . Keeps the costs down , keeps the software in the greatest compatibility , but Sony 's lead time could 've allowed for Palm 5 . And it 's not truly upgradable either : you patch it . Ah well . # 5 : It doesn't come with a cradle . Yeah , the fifth star is withheld on that alone . Cradles are a necessity , and while I do give Sony credit for the compact travel sync / charge option , I expect a cradle with any PDA . Period . Let 's sum up . A solid four stars , a really good choice for your 1st PDA ( it 'll go around two hundred ) , an outstanding upgrade from older PDAs ( especially B & Ws ; and lo-res color ) , and an all-around high performer . If you don't need a camera , Memory Stick Pro capacities , or Palm OS 5 , this is your best bang for the buck .  
2	  Bottom-Line : Final analysis : the " LS 700VA " does what it is supposed to do-protect my computer from harmful electrical events and provide a source of emergency power ; it does it well . APC targets the " Back-UPS LS 700VA " towards advanced home and or small office user . The " Back-UPS LS 700VA " is a 700VA / 410W UPS designed to provide short-term emergency ( battery ) power to a computer , monitor , and essential peripherals in the event of a power outage or noise . According to APC product literature , the " Back-UPS LS 700VA " can provide up to 70 minutes at 50 watts , 31 minutes at 100 watts , 12 minutes at 200 watts , 5 minutes at 300 watts , and 2 minutes at 400 watts , or full load . This is enough time to enable you , or the system itself , to save work and shutdown the computer in an orderly fashion . The " Back-UPS LS 700VA " has an unusual shape ; while it is free standing like traditional UPS systems at the same price point , the " Back-UPS LS 700VA " has the outlets at the top of the unit vice the back . The reason for this unusual design ? APC calls it a unique space-saving , ergonomic design , I call it weird , but it works so .. The Back-UPS LS 700VA is equipped with four battery-powered / surge protected outlets and three regular surge protected outlets on the top of the unit , with one of the four outlets on each side spaced to provide room for those ubiquitous transformer blocks . Like all modern UPS units the " Back-UPS LS 700VA " can provide surge protection for a phone line ( RJ-11 ) , but not an Ethernet network connection ( RJ-45 ) , and coax cable ( DSL ) . Connection for one input and output is provided and a re-settable circuit breaker and a USB connector ( interface with computer ) is located on the back of the unit . The control panel on the top front of the unit contains LED status displays indicators , for On-Line , On-Battery , replace Battery , and Overload . The " Back-UPS LS 700VA " also features a long 6-foot cord , an audible alarm , and user-replaceable , hot-swappable battery . The battery " Back-UPS LS 700VA " in the is a maintenance-free , leak-proof , lead-acid battery with Intelligent Battery Management , that features Micro-processor controlled battery charging and diagnostic testing ensures maximum battery life . Testing and UseI have attached the " Back-UPS LS 700VA " with an Pentium 4 3.00GHz PC powered by an Antec 300W power supply . There is nothing else plugged into the UPS , although on occasion I use it when I am building a new workstation or server . After charging the battery for 6 hours , I put the UPS in place , connected the USB and installed the PowerChute Personal Edition software . Like all APC UPS systems the " Back-UPS LS 700VA " initially indicated that I had more batter back up time then I knew was feasible , in this case about 1:45 minutes of battery backup time . Grated the load was light , but not that light . So in order to get a more accurate estimate of battery backup time , as is my custom , I simulated a power outage by unplugging the unit from the wall outlet , and let the UPS do its thing . The " Back-UPS LS 700VA " can only keep the system on as long as it battery holds out , and through PowerChute Personal Edition it will dynamically update the estimated time remaining on the battery as it starts discharging . As soon as the " Back-UPS LS 700VA " was unplugged it went to battery power and I received a popup box on my screen that stating , " your battery backup is now supplying battery power to your equipment . " An ( annoying but effective ) audible alarm sounded and produces four beeps every 30 seconds . This alarm can be disabled via the software . After approximately 10:00 minutes , battery power had dropped to 50 % and after 15 minutes power drifted below 35 % and after 20 minutes , power dropped to below ten percent . I then plugged the UPS back into the wall , and after several hours of recharging the " Back-UPS LS 700VA " was back to full capacity , and the estimated battery time had changed from to a believable 25 minutes . ConclusionTo me a UPS is a must have , and the " Back-UPS LS 700VA " is a solid investment in my book . The average life of a UPS battery is approximately four years , and my LS 700VA cost me $ 129.00 retail , which some may think is a little too expensive . Since installing the " Back-UPS LS 700VA " , I have suffered through two blackout and one noise events , all of which could have seriously damaged the server , or the components inside . If viewed in that light the Back-UPS LS 700VA has more then paid for itself . How much is your data worth ? And I run a small business from my home ; my computers are on 24/7 . Data production is paramount , and I can't afford the downtime associated with damaged equipment as a result of a power event . Purchasing the Back-UPS LS 700VA just makes good business and personal sense . In the final analysis the " Back-UPS LS 700VA " does what it is supposed to do-protect my computer from harmful electrical events and provide a stable source of emergency power-and it does it exceedingly well . With enough power to support almost all of today 's power-hungry computers , monitors and printers , not to mention the odd peripheral the " Back-UPS LS 700VA " is the idea solution for home and small office users .  
1	  The Good : This thing actually does sound pretty respectable . It has a pretty powerful amplifier for a table radio , and for a radio in this price range , the sound is definitely satisfactory . The Bad : The NR31 has a poor quality , non-removable FM wire antenna . External FM or AM antennas cannot be used . FM reception is predictably poor . There is an auxiliary input , but there is no selector for it ; your CD player , MP3 player , or other device will be active whenever it is plugged in . Furthermore , FM radio is audible when the aux input is in use . The Ugly : The FM / AM selector is defective . It stopped working on my unit within days . It is now impossible to listen to AM radio on my NR31 , and other NR31 owners have had the same problem . I would recommend this radio to almost no one , regardless of the price . It might be worth considering if you don't do any AM listening , but many more expensive tabletop radios are ultimately a better value .  
2	  This is my first prime lens , and my second lens purchase , and it was exactly what I was looking for . If you 're just starting out in photography and haven't shot with a prime before , it 's an experience I 'd recommend ( removing the zoom forces you to think about where you 're standing and makes me more inclined to fiddle with other features which have a larger impact in the resulting photos ) . The low f-stop is absolutely fantastic for shooting photos in real world indoor lighting situations . The only negative thing I have to say about this lens is that it has no IS , but that seems to be the norm for < 300 mm prime lenses .. the lack of IS causes me a bit of a headache when I 'm trying to shoot in low light without a tripod and want to ensure I 've got my subject in sharp focus .  
2	  I looked a long time for a large slow cooker with the " Auto " setting that switches from high to low when the contents reaches cooking temperature .  
2	  I have a Netflix subscription and receive DVDs in the mail . There are a high number of these discs that have scratches and smudges on them . Rather than send it back because it won't play correctly I give them a quick wipe with these cloths and have had success with almost every DVD .  
2	  This antenna is well worth it for people with reception problems . I live in Point Loma in San diego and with a rabbit ear I can only receive channel 8 . With this antenna I was able to receive 34 channels including KTLA and NBC4 in OC .  
1	  I rarely give bad reviews to something , mostly because i usually research the heck out of anything well before i buy it . So while I ended up giving this product away after the first time I used it , I don't feel like I can give it the worst rating since I only used it once . A lot of the issues I had with it ( syncing was cumbersome and didn't work well , i had to attempt it several times , resetting the device requires you to remove the clip that covers the battery slot , then remove the battery slot cover , etc .. ) I probably would have worked around them given enough time . In the end this product wasn't usable because it simply stopped working after 410 degrees . The second it hits 411 degrees , it goes to ' hh ' instead of the temperature . I had to dig through the sheets of documentation to find out that it doesn't support anything higher then that and just defaults to ' hh ' when it does . This is probably not something that would affect most people who bought ( or are going to buy ) it , but it should have been somewhere in the product specs or the reviews , not buried in the troubleshooting section of the manual . My grill regularly gets up in the 500-600 range when searing steaks or cooking pizza 's , so the whole point of buying this was to replace the non-digital one i have today ( which tops out at 730-ish ) . Sadly , it 's useless to me so i ended up giving it away to my neighbor who uses a gas grill . Buyer beware and all that .  
2	  To start I believe I paid $ 24 for this cable , I don't know why anyone would pay more than that . This cable not only sounds good but looks sweet . I 've used this cable for probably two and-a-half years . I went from a Digital Coaxial to this and could tell a huge difference in the sound immediately . A huge opening in the space time con .. not really , but seriously this cable sounded like it was unrestrained and uninhibited from anything ! I found the sound to be wide open and a lot more broad than the coax . I 'm sure that 's to be expected of a fiber optic but still , sounded good and I 'm happy with it . I 'm not really a " believer " in Monster Cables nor am I a huge fan or anything but I find their products to be swell enough . I have yet to pay over the price of this cable ( $ 24 ) for one of their products and probably never will . I would not pay full retail for one of their cables just because I know I don't have to . ( this cable retail for $ 70 , you can get it for $ 22 .. ) I reviewed one of their THX Ultra stereo interconnects and some of their component video cables . I mentioned that if you can get these cables for half or a quarter retail , as they are plentiful in this price range on the web , try them out and know the product , THEN write a review about it . I have never compared a " high end " Fiber Optic cable with this cable , or any other fiber optic for that matter , probably never will . I have no idea how they could sound any different , I mean Glass is glass . When it comes to getting something like thisAudioQuest Diamond OptiLink 1.5m ( 4.92 ft . ) Optical Audio CableI 'm not sure what 's goin on there , to each his own I suppose . and like I said , you can get them cheap if you look for them and just want to try them out . * EDIT * I just remembered that I actually own their JP900 surge protector that I did pay over $ 40 for .  
1	  I was excited to start using this microphone for text dictation software and the product did not work , checked on 3 computers , MAC OS X 10.6 , windows xp and windows vista . No Luck :(  
1	  I ordered this product and was sent the Zeikos card reader in black instead . I ordered two and the company taped them together with packaging tape . I now have two very sticky card readers to throw in the trash . I would not order anything from this company .  
2	  The first unit I got did not work and Cyberhome replaced it within their stated ten days . The points I would like to emphasize is the volume is not loud enough , either watching it on the screen or through the television and utilizing the volume in this manner . We had the volume at the highest level on the television and still it was not effective for movie viewing . The key is not to use the battery or keep it in the player unless you are viewing through the player . My children and I took an Amtrak train over spring break and used this DVD player to watch movies for both trips . I like the sleek look to this DVD player , but too many options to figure out with the remote .  
2	  setup was very simple , plug in the ethernet wires to the router , power it up , configure the other computers with router setup wizard or manually - do this on the primary computer , set security options , router assigns IP 's .. that 's all , start using it . I had great connectivity to my lappy for about 4-6 rooms down the hallway ( worked for me ) moreover the router is light weight , nice design , looks cool , for the price it 's a great purchase  
2	  this worked perfectly for me , I had my first dust spots after 2 years so didn't want to spend a fortune . This little packet did the job fits in my camera case and in 10 mins my spots were gone .  
2	  If you go to any department store you would pay between $ 30-$40 for what you get here . delivered on time .  
1	  DO NOT BUY THIS THING ! Has got to be the worst piece of crap I 've ever owned . Agreed with most other reviewers - the instructions ( esp . syntax of commands not to mention the English grammar ) are HORRIBLE ! But the main problem overall is that it is simply God-awful UNRELIABLE ! I 've had it for about 6 months and have experienced at least 3 false alarms . Not armed , sitting there in my family room just watching TV and all of a sudden one of the sirens starts blaring for no reason . Another time my wife and I were awoken in the middle of the night with the thing ringing . We did NOT arm it at night . Not only that , but it won't always shut OFF reliably ! 3AM and my wife and I are frantically pushing the disarm button on the remote , siren still blaring away . Sometimes the remote works , sometimes not ( yes , it and everything has fresh batteries - oh , but they discharge within a few months , even name-brand ) . Then , the range is terrible . We don't have a big house , single story , but some of the further away door sensors don't trigger the alarm . I also ( regretfully ) bought the outdoor siren . Works maybe half the time , and it 's only about 30 feet away from console . Then there are the motion sensors , which only sense a motion every 5 seconds . I can walk past the range of one easily within 5 seconds and the light never flashes . Sometimes to get it to flash I have to stand in front of it and wave my hands wildly . ( I suppose if a burglar did that it might ring .. ) I 'd give this piece of junk 0 stars if I could .  
2	  I typically would spend more , and have , in fact this was gotten as a temporary solution , since I broke a collar bone and was not comfortable with a regular backpack . However , this thing has proven to be quite useful , and comfortable . It certainly does not have the protection of a brenthaven , but it 's pretty good . It fits either at 15.4 macbook pro or a 17 , though with the 17 inch macbook pro it 's not protected very well . It also works as a regular backpack for carrying whatever as I have packed a lot of stuff in there and it holds up . So yeah for the money I think this is difficult to beat as a laptop bag .  
1	  The camera barely fit inside the case and it does not have a strap for ease of handling . It does have a belt loop handle but it is made to slide onto your belt as opposed to a clip-on which is far more convienant . I would not recommend .  
2	  I got this for my son 's computer ; he had a fairly old wireless adapter prior to this one . He was having a big problem with lag when he played WOW or some other on-line games . This adapter fixed those problems . Plus installation is a snap . It didn't get a five rating because I don't care much for the Linksys software . It takes over from the Windows Configuration settings for the wireless adapters but it seems to lose it 's settings a bit . So , after installation , switch back to the Windows wireless configurations and thinks work well .  
2	  This is a great little pda for those who want to keep track of dates , phone numbers and such-it 's not meant to be more ! I think it 's great for what it 's meant to do and the price makes it extremely attractive ! I had a Tungsten E before this and I loved it but , as my life has changed so have my needs and this fits the bill perfectly !  
1	  Despite my years of experience with computer systems , it took me two long evenings to get this thing working . The installation instructions made no mention that a separate power cable is required . This was my first graphics card that required supplemental power . Apparently , I 'm just supposed to automatically know this . My motherboard complained that the card was not connected to the power supply . In fact , the installation instructions were so generic ( but in many languages ) , they were essentially useless . But I did follow the instructions to uninstall the existing video drivers . When starting the system again , it wanted to install the VGA Controller . This step failed and the instructions said to install my Windows CD . I did so , but the system was still unable to install the VGA Controller driver . And the drivers for the new card won't install without an existing VGA Controller . Back and forth to the web , the motherboard 's CD , safe mode - none of these worked as per the installation instructions and various other web references . ATI 's web site did not have a working support section . It was conveniently under construction . The merchant 's web site , Monarch Computer Systems , had another link for ATI support , but this too was broken . I was able to find ATI 's drivers , cryptically named " Crystal " , which apparently makes sense to them . It was not obvious whether this would help me . But I downloaded them and despite not having a working VGA Controller , the Radeon drivers installed and the card came up . So the vendor shipped a useless installation CD . The installer produced generic and misleading error messages that did not lead to a solution . I put that CD in the garbage ! For this kind of money , I am sorely disappointed with the lack of attention to support and the installer . Since the installer was my first impression of the company , I now have a very poor impression of ATI / Sapphire . If you 're not a computer hardware genius , do not purchase this card . BTW , the card 's performance is excellent . In this regard , my expectations have been exceeded .  
2	  This player , while it does have some of the shortcomings described in other reviews , is also one of the best values in mp3 players on the market right now . The user interface is easy , it has been very reliable for me and the sound is very good . I am thrilled with the purchase as is a friend of mine who also bought one . It has never given me any problems , skipped , or otherwise misbehaved .  
1	  We were so happy when we bought our first GPS unit 8 months ago . But our experience with TomTom GO510 has been a frustrating one . The unit requires frequent resets , sometimes right in the middle of unfamiliar places . If we ever forgot to bring a pin , we had to resort to the good old map to get us out of the jam . To TomTom 's credit , it did replace promptly our dead unit after initial 2 months of use . But the unit consistently failed to find our California home , even after a most recent map update . Granted , the housing development was only about 2 years old . But , we had reported its coordinates to TomTom right after we received the unit . It was even more ridiculous when the unit reported errors during a recent route computationfrom New Jersey to the JFK Airport . TomTom 510 is not worth the price .  
2	  Arrived pronto ! I rate this item and the service thereto as superissimo ! I rate this item and the service thereto as superissimo !  
2	  I have read some of the reviews on this site , and I just don't understand . I use these headphones everyday . I just moved to NY , and before I would work out with these headphones exclusively . A little much for working out .. Perhaps , but these things stay put . I run the wire over my ears and down the inside back of my shirt . It also keeps out any noise . This later trait would become invaluable as i recently moved to NY . They truly do keep out the noise . There are times where I wear them with no music on just to feel some sort of isolation ( which is hard to achieve on a crowded subway . ) With music on , there is no better sound . I love music , and interned at a music label ; however , these are great for anyone who loves music . You can really hear the small things that you miss otherwise . I had a problem after about a year of use . The left side suddenly stopped making noise . I sent them into shure , and a week later had a completely new replacement pair . Pretty good customer service . Do yourself a favor , even if its not this pair , check these out . Any shure product of this type is many times better than the free pair you get with your ipod . If you don't have an ipod , then perhaps you should think about getting one of those too .. but i digress .  
1	  I bought this camera to be able to shoot close ups with the macro mode . Very disappointed . I was never able to shoot at close range and have the the picture turn out . Very grainy ! The software was not easily installed . You need to read the directions from 3 differant instruction booklets that came with it . A little bit of info from one book , a little more from another etc . I purchase this thinking it would be a great camera from reading all the " great " feedbacks . Not sure why someone would recommend this one .  
2	  I have read the reviews and was worried about the paper curling .. So , does it curl ? well ok , a little .. if you look carefully from the side .. but come on , what do you want for $ 100 . This is simply an awesome personal printer . It is very fast ( as fast as the network printers at work .. ok at least " my " work ) , the print quality is good ( slightly grainy on images , but not noticable on text ) , and the ease of networking capabilities is why I bought it ! The form factor is perfect . It 's big enough to fit the paper inside , but small enough to fit comfortably on your desk . To sum up .. if you want a cheap , fast , " good " quality , networkable printer , this is it ! Oh yea .. remember , this is a " laser " printer . Say it with me now .. " laaser printer " . That means that it is Black & White , NOT color . If you expected a color laser for $ 100 , then I have a bridge to sell you .  
2	  Maybe it 's just a cord , but it 's a perfect cord . I agree with all the positive things others have said about the length and thickness . Still , the most important thing to me is it 's tangle-free . This cord is made of the same stuff as the cord to my Audio Technica headphones which also doesn't tangle . Both are not coiled . Perfect !  
1	  I have 2 of these receivers . One I purchased here and another supplied by DISH . I am having issues with both . The refurbished one I purchased here lasted just long enough to get past the warranty . I started having problems with this receiver suddenly shutting off and back on by itself several weeks ago . The incidents at first were few and far between and usually at times when the TV was not on . Recently , however , whenever I turned on the TV , the receiver would shut off and I could not get it back on with either the remote or the receiver 's power button . Then suddenly it would turn on by itself and instantly go off . It would go into a loop of on and off until I finally unplugged it from the outlet . The receiver supplied by dish , will loose the signal and I have to do a hard reset by unplugging the power while the receiver is on . Sometimes this works with the first reset and sometimes not . I 'm calling DISH to see if they have better receivers than these pieces of junk !  
1	  I went to a sporting goods store , bought a true water proof carry bag thats twice the size and was half the price . Now my Dig . Rebel , PLUS a second point and shoot dig . camera , 2 lenses , Canon 's 420 flash , multi filters , charger and cleaning products fit with room to spare . Don't rush out to purchase this bag , you 'll regret it .  
1	  This camera has a chronic flaw : The zoom becomes stuck . Search the web for the name of the camera followed by " zoom stuck " and read the misery . A few fixes have been suggested , but those apparently don't work for most people . Essentially , if the camera isn't under warranty , it becomes worthless . I just tossed mine in the trash after trying the fixes to no avail and being advised that the cost to fix it will be much more than it 's value . We had used this camera very gently for its short , short life ; basically a disposable camera .  
1	  THIS ' MYSKY PERSONAL GUIDE ' DID NOT WORK FROM THE FIRST TIME I TRIED IT.I GOT A " RETURN FOR REPAIR MESSAGE " ON IT THE FIRST TIME I TRIED TO USE IT . IF YOU FIND ONE THAT WORKS PROPERLY YOU ARE VERY LUCKY . THIS PRODUCT NEEDS TO BE REENGINEERED .  
1	  E Machine Laptop heats up and shuts off and the monitor flickers . I have sent it back three times and today is the fourth time , as it continues to shut off and flickers . I have it for less than a year , and I cannot get my money back . I have written the Attorney General at their Irvine , California headquarters to try to get my money back . Let 's hope that works .

2	  This is the second mapping GPS I have owned , and it is nearly perfect for my needs . I can't believe how much better this eTrex Legend is than my old eMap unit . First , the bright color display is clear and readable in direct sunlight . My laptop wouldn't even be visible in those conditions . Battery life - there is no comparison ! I haven't yet changed the alkaline batteries in 4 weeks of use ( modestly heavy as it is a new toy ) . Finally , it is so sensitive that it has never failed to get a satellite position while indoors . Again , the HCx is a major improvement over the previous model where I could lose reception inside my car with glass all around and in open countryside . Pros : Light weight , small size , fits great in one hand . Can be operated completely with one hand . Display is amongst the sharpest and brightest I have ever seen . Very intuitive and simple to use for anyone except possibly a newbie to GPS navigation . Battery life seems endless . Ability to map a route to a destination address entered at the unit with the City Navigator software installed - the entire U.S. and Canada detailed road maps and POI fit on a single 1 GB micro-SD flash card . Useful in your car or outdoors for hiking , boating , fishing , snowmobiling , motorcycling , etc . A true all-in-one GPS solution for a low price . Cons : Small display compared to Nuvi series and other non-outdoor GPS units . No voice directions - it has two types of tones to alert you to pending and imminent turns . You need to add $ 120 worth of City Navigator mapping software to enable the auto-routing by address or point of interest functions . The click-stick 5-way joystick navigation device is not the easiest thing to use to move around the maps and menus . Overall I am very happy with my purchase and I expect to get at least 5 or 6 years of good use from this before I will be looking at replacements . Garmin quality and service has been excellent in my opinion ; my eMap still works , though it will likely be relegated to a desk drawer .  
1	  My FM Transmitter stopped working about a week after I bought my Belkin Tunebase FM for Zune . Not a great loss though since the sound was terrible to say the least . At least it charges my zune and functions decently as a place to mount my zune . Still , I am very disappointed this product broke after just one week .  
1	  When I got my set I was really upset to find out that somebody tried to installed this set up before All the pick ups had the wires cut up really short showing an attempt to install them by splicing the previous connections not to rewire the whole thing , the middle pickup was defective .. I got a new set but it took two weeks however the people from the store were OK , I only cannot understand why I got a set that was used and with a defective component , I sent an email to Amazon to report the problem no response , I had to look up the phone number of the seller , the item ( S ) itself was what I was looking for .. not a good experience  
2	  I upgraded from the 2620 to the 2720 because this one actually speaks with the names of the streets or freeway so you don't have to look at the screen while you are driving . Very user friendly !  
2	  I took the leap and bought this hub , even after reading an unfavorable review here at Amazon . The hub is a bit odd because it does not have its own power source . After researching all over the net , I realized this was actually good design , not a defect . It 's actually very nice to have one less power cord hanging from the desk top . I have a pair of speakers , a wireless keyboard , a digital camera , and a USB pen drive plugged into the hub now for over a month without any problems . I also have a firewire iPod plugged in . I have had no power issues . My guess is that the combination of power from the firewire and USB cords that plug into your Mac Mini work together to send power where its needed . I tested the hub with a " Kill-A-Watt " meter and found that it only raised the power consumption of the Mac Mini by about 3 watts while in standby mode . The one annoyance I will report is going to be with the USB standard in general . It appears that some USB devices have a " slightly " shorther plug than others . This difference is in millimeters , but it was an issue with my " Lexar USB pen drive . " The pen drive will not plug into this hub and power on every time . This is because the Belkin hub has a very thin skin of plastic between the USB ports and the device plug . I 've read other reviews with other hubs where this is an issue . You should take a couple of your USB device cables and hold them next to each other to see an length difference . If you find any plugs that are slightly smaller then the rest , it may not work with this hub . This issue is annoying , but easily fixed . I just plugged the pen drive into an USB extension cable , and then plugged the cable into the hub . I don't fault Belkin on this issue . I fault Lexar for not making the plug long enough . All the rest of my devices fit fine . This issue of the USB plug length may be confused with other power issues in reviews for this hub . I believe that the hub provides plenty of power for it 's devices . I just think some older devices may not have a long enough plug to fit those last couple of millimeters into the socket .  
2	  If you are looking for a convienant way to organize your Music , Movies and Pictures the 80 gigabyte iPod is a must have . It has enough memory to hold all the songs you will need to complete your personal soundtrack as you go through out your day . And during those down times when you need something else to watch rather than your own life , you can select from a variety of movies that you can load and unload from your iPod . And when you are stuck with a stranger and have nothing to talk about , your picture library can help you brag how cool your life is and helps explain how popular you have become . It is slim and small so it can fit in your pocket without a bulge and it is light so it isn't a burden to carry it around . I have had my iPod for a few months now and love it !  
2	  I purchased these speakers for use with an iPod Touch 4G and I couldn't be more pleased ! They sound great and work fine as a recharging station even without listening . I 'm going to get a couple more sets for use in other buildings on the property . When away from an outlet , battery life is pretty short , and the music quality suffers mightily as the batteries weaken , but I don't often listen to music outdoors , so that doesn't matter to me . They 'll work well for an afternoon of weed-pulling in the garden once in a while , anyway . :-)  
2	  I was programming an Ipod for a friend and became interested in buying one for myself . I went to the store to get some info on the Ipod , and luckily the departments store I frequent didn't carry the unit , but offered the Zune . I came straight home , did my reasearch , and ordered on the same day . The Zune is far more superior than any Ipod model that I have either read about or experienced for myself . And a much better deal moneywise . I must say that you shouldn't get a Zune unless you are running a Windows version with SP2 or higher , for any other ver . won't recognize the unit . I had a pc w / SP1 and Media Center 2002 , so I thought I was in trouble . Against my initial thoughts on SP2 , I went ahead and upgraded , and haven't had any problems yet . The sound is great , videos are decent , and the software is very user friendly . I would check out the other models of media players , especially the Archos brand , for they have a bigger screen and hard drive . But for audio and a few videos , this unit is worth the money .  
2	  The product worked as promised . I have a Dell Inspiron 600m bought in 2005 and my graphics card ATI Mobility Radeon 9000 did not work with similar converter i bought from radio shack for 24 $ . The converter from radio shack did work on my friends computer that was purchased on 2006 . I had an old graphics card and also ATI did not support Catalyst Control centre software for my graphics card . Read the reviews about this product and bought it . The quality is great and my computer detected my TV right away . This is a great product for such low price . And the shipping cost was also 4 $ . I bought 2 of them and they work as promised .  
2	  Recieved the battery quick . We wanted an extra battery to take to Tikal in Guatemala to take pictures of the mayan ruins because last time our battery died pretty quick and we missed out on taking lots of great pics . This time everything was perfect and having this extra battery was great . It lasted a long time and this time there was no missed photo ops ! Thanks !  
2	  This is truly an outstanding product . Ideal for my situation - where my TV has only digital optical audio output , but my AV receiver has only digital coax audio input . Converts between digital optical and digital coax while keeping the signal entirely in the digital domain , so there are no distortions introduced by D / A or A / D conversions . Unit has a high quality , all metal cabinet with rubber feet and can easily be placed behind your AV components . Well done !  
1	  Item received isn't as pictured . Tried to contact seller to no avail . Would like to get it resolved .  
2	  Love this lens ! Good sharpness at F8 ( rivals a Canon 24-70 F2.8 wide open ) . Decent sharpness elsewhere except for 35mm wide open . Got this lens after 2 professional wedding photographers recommended it to photographers on a budget . The focal length range is excellent . Probably the most outstanding feature of this lens is the USM focusing . It focuses FAST , quiet and with perfect focus . This lens over achieves a bit as it is not the sharpest lens around but it nails the focus every time making it seem sharper than perhaps other lens that have the potential to be sharper if they had as good of focusing system . The USM is the focus system used on Canon 's L series so it is the best focus system Canon makes - it shows ! Wedding Cake maker picked my picture of the cake over a friend 's picture of the same - he shot it with a Canon 40D with Canon 's 24-105 F4 L lens and photo shopped the picture . I just used Canon 's delivered DPP software and a Canon T1i . So this lens is good enough are you ?  
1	  Love everything about this drive EXCEPT for the LACK if a ON / OFF BUTTON ! If this drive is left ON long it gets VERY HOT .. it will eventually die out if left on ! When I called IOMEGA Cust . Support , they told me the solution for dealing with this would be to unplug the drive when Im not using it and to plus it in each time I use it - HOW REDICULOUS ! POOR DESIGN because of this one , but MAJOR FLAW !  
2	  I purchased this for my trip to cancun to charge up my ipod at the airports . It worked great and does everything it 's suppose to do . The sticker on the usb cable fell off , but that 's not a big deal . The price is great . I would highly recommend this for anyone with ipod , iphone , etc .  
2	  This is exactly what a needed . It works great for podcasts and talking on the phone . Music quality is " ok . " I like the fact that it has a place to plug in another power adapter . Very easy to hook up . It messed with my GPS but I changed frequencies and I am a happy cat now .  
2	  I did a lot of research before I purchased this Brother MFC-665CW . Other than the standard Fax , Copy , Scan functions of an all-in-one , my primary criteria was that it have a 802.11b / g wireless interface and a small footprint . Without the phone handset , which doesn't have to be installed when unpacking , this unit is only 15.5 " wide . Depth is 14.6 " and height is a tiny 7.1 " . The software installation and Wi-Fi configuration was very easy . The Control Center software is user friendly and using it with the unit is simple . Scanning documents to the PC over Wi-Fi is seamless . I was very impressed with how well the automatic document feeder works for a small unit . Another positive is that it has independant ink tanks so you only replace each color as needed . Definitely a great all-in-one that I am very happy with . Highly recommended .  
1	  We purchased one originally on 11/14/05 , it started with the funky , jumbled , letters , numbers , signs , etc within 6-7 months . I took it back to the Discovery Channel store where they gladly replaced it . The new one lasted even less time , and given that they didn't issue me a refund / new receipt from the first return ( my mistake for not insisting ) I could only show the one initial purchase from 11/14/05 . They refused an exchange or refund even though I was within the one year warranty period . However , I did call the 866-537-0384 Wave Customer Service number upon arriving home and they mailed me a new one ! Didn't even ask for proof of purchase ! Even though the product is not well made , they have EXCELLENT customer service !  
1	  I ordered this television from Amazon on January 15 , 2007 . The shipping estimate in the confirmation e-mail was 16 January , with a delivery estimate between 19 and 23 January . The item shipped on January 16th , with an estimated arrival date of 25 January . At first , I couldn't locate a website for " Eagle . " The actual company name is " Eagle Global Logistics , " and Googling that will yield their website . Their tracking information is pretty poor , as the updates didn't seem to make any sense . It would report my shipment arriving in Columbus on one day , and the next day it would update with that day 's date , again reporting it had " arrived . " This went on for a few days . On January 23rd , the item arrived at Jacksonville Airport , and I received a phone call from " EGL " to set a delivery appointment . I was told the earliest date they could deliver was on January 26th . I asked for an earlier date , but was told the only date I could have was the 26th , and that the best they could offer for an appointment was a four-hour window . " Free shipping , " does not include the four hours of vacation time one has to take to sit around waiting for the delivery truck . I arrived home at 12:00pm today , and as these things go , the truck arrived at 4:00pm . I buzzed them through the gate , then waited several minutes until EGL called and asked me where my unit was located . I gave them directions and met the truck at the curb . When they opened the truck , the TV was lying part-way on its side , as though it had fallen over . They insisted that they had done that , to " lay it down " as they didn't have cargo straps to carry it upright as the box clearly states . Based on the experiences of others here at Amazon , I expected them to take the TV upstairs , unbox it and set it up so that I could be confident it was delivered in working order . They had no such understanding , they were adamant they were only to take it into my unit and that was the extent of their service . The didn't unbox the unit . I signed for it noting that the condition was unknown , and no set-up service was offered . I believe my order qualified for " White Glove " service , though I have no idea what that really entails . I rather doubt that this was it . After they left , I immediately opened the box , and was disappointed to discover a large crack in the glass of the display . Basically , about one quarter of the panel would separate from the remainder of the panel if it weren't held together in the frame . I called EGL and they told me to take it up with Amazon . I called Amazon 's 1-800 number , which has always been a very satisfactory service in the past . Unfortunately , they seem to have made some changes . No combination of menu choices I tried could seem to connect me to a human being . Instead , I received repeated messages directing me to go to the web site to process my return . So , disappointed and believing I will not get the kind of timely response I expect from a web form , I went ahead and tried to process my return on the web page , only to receive an unspecified error message . So I 'm writing this review , doing my best to remain composed and as unemotional as possible . The service provided by EGL was unsatisfactory . I believe the TV was damaged in shipment , though of course I have no way of knowing if EGL received it that way or not . In any event , EGL 's customer service was surly , lethargic and unsatisfactory . Amazon 's customer service , at the time of this post , is non-existent ! I have no way to initiate any effort to have this item returned . I am in no way interested in waiting another 10 days for a replacement to be delivered . I am in no way interested in spending another four hours of vacation waiting for a delivery company to come and collect this enormous , inert box occupying my living room , . I have been a very satisfied Amazon customer for many years now , and ordinarily I would be inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt . But this new 1-800 number policy , and malfunctioning web services are unsatisfactory . At this point , the savings offered by no sales tax and a low price have been wiped out by the time , aggravation and inconvenience of this experience . I have no idea how I will be able to speak to someone in customer service in order to arrange for an exchange under terms that would be acceptable to me . I 'm inclined to think it would simply be better to request a refund , toss the box down the stairs and let it sit outside until someone comes along to collect it , and go buy the unit at Best Buy . I 'm having a party here next weekend , and the TV was to be a big part of that . I really have no idea how I 'm going to get to be able to speak , e-mail or smoke-signal someone at Amazon . So , this is just one data point . Others have clearly had much better experiences . But if something goes wrong , expect it to go wrong badly . It won't be a simple matter to clear it up . I 'm very disappointed and dissatisfied with Amazon in this transaction .  
1	  This was my first noise-canceling headphone purchase . They are verycomfortable headphones and fit perfectly over my large head and ears . However I purchased them for the noise canceling qualities reviewedby other reviewers . I was dis-satisfied by the results however . It has some canceling ability but very little . When I turned them on I heard acomforting hiss from the headphones ( no music playing ) which drownedout background noise but I wouldn't call it canceling . I hadto return the headphones as I expected more . Perhaps I was expectingtoo much . They were probably worth it for there comfort but I wasexpecting more canceling capabilities .  
2	  We bought this product after buying a new vehicle . Our car was larger than the last one and when the kids quickly opened the door it often hit the stone beam of our car port . This product has helped the driver move up just far enough for both doors to open without a major paint scraping . The only down side is making sure we are far enough to the left so our right doors don't hit and still leaving room for the right side to be far enough away for foot traffic . That would be a perfect world ! Great product for what it is designed to do .  
2	  Somewhat of a novice in this field I relied on recommendation of associate and some limited online product research prior to purchase . I am uniformly pleased with the product and all of it 's features , the design and user interface are clean and efficient . I had little trouble getting it up and running and it performs well in all modes .  
1	  On nearly the second anniversary of receiving this player , the table stopped spinning . I called Numark and since it was out of warranty there was nothing they could do for me . The player was awesome . It one of my favorite belongings . The sound was pretty good for a built-in speaker . None of my records were damaged by the player , and the speed never seemed to waver . I gave it one star for every year of enjoyment I got . I 'll be buying a crosley next , and if that one craps out I would probably buy another Numark . I just wish it hadn't have broken in the first place .  
1	  Bad quality product . Worked for two days only . I used to trust on San Disk Products , but now I 'll think twice before buying any product from San Disk . I 'm very upset  
2	  Great buy for the monies , Amazon has great service . If you want to spend more monies you can buy LNT 4671-120 MHz or if you still more monies you can buy Sony XBR4 . I am very happy with my LNT4665 . Just connected and played . I have had no kinks or problems . Also combined it with Samsung BDP1400 Blu Ray . Absolutely fantastic . Would recommend it . It is better than anything out there in this price range .  
1	  I have both the i250 and the i350 . The i250 print head failed after 3 months of use ( blank lines in the middle of words ) , but was still under warranty , so I managed to persuade Canon to send me a new print head . BTW , the print head costs about $ 45 to $ 50 .. almost the same as cost of the printer . Next , I upgraded to the i350 . This time , the print head took 8 months to fail .. same problem . I regard these as disposable printers , nothing more . They work great until the print heads fail .  
1	  Had this set for about 4 months of daily pc gaming use . Only put them on and taken them off and laid on desk at night and microphone would work sporadically after the first 6 weeks due to the poor construction of the in-line volume controls . I would have to twist and fool with the wires to get it to work . AT times it was impossible until I tried the next day . I 'm an electronics enginner so I took apart the in-line controls and checked the construction and the wires are microscopic that connect to a tiny I mean real tiny pc board . This is where they fray and lose contact . watch out for these because in time the solder contact where the mic is attached on this board will come off the board completely rendering them useless unless you want just headphones . Steer clear and look somewhere else .  
1	  There 's nothing wrong with these headphones . They 're fine . However the foam covers lasted only a few months and I can't find any replacements anywhere . The headphones are therefore uncomfortable to wear and I 'm in the process of replacing these headphones with something more robust .  
1	  This is a great product for its normal price of $ 99.00 , not $ 139.00 ! The Apple store still sells it for $ 99.00 ! They sell it separately , the A / V cable with the charging unit $ 49.00 , then the remote kit $ 49.00 ! I have purchased several from Amazon for the correct price of $ 99.00 ! Hopefully this price will be corrected soon !  
2	  This device is awesome . It works best with Windows Media Player 10.0 - dont bother installing the Napster software .  
1	  I run a busy accounting office and cannot afford to shut down because the printer cartridge runs out or we are out of paper or other supplies . In January I ordered a cartridge for my HP 4050se printer to have on hand when the old cartridge expired . It sat on the shelf for a few weeks before I actually needed it the first week of April . From the very first page it printed the copies were streaked and blurry . When I contacted the vendor " Databazaar " they pointed out that it was over 60 days since I ordered it and there was nothing they could do . A cursory examination would have revealed that the cartridge was full , not used and clearly defective but they were not even willing to look at it . So much for the " 100 % compatible " guarantee . The moral of this story is , it was a $ 27 gamble compared to the $ 106 cost of a genuine HP cartridge . So it was an inexpensive lesson . But if I did not have another printer in the office it could have been a very expensive lesson . If the performance of your printer is important to your livelihood don't fool around with so called " compatible " cartridges . Barry Perl CPA , Miami , Florida .  
1	  The promotion and advertising for this product states that this would download 1000 songs . Knowing that some songs are longer than others etc . , I figured that I 'd be able to load at least 900 + . However , in downloading from my computer , I could only load 426 songs . Naturally being quite upset , I contacted the Creative Company , and they said : " Music files encoded at higher bitrate are much larger than music files encoded at lower bitrate , thus it reduces the number of songs a player can store " . They then talked about 32 versus 64 bitrate etc . To me this is something close to false advertising , because NOTHING whatsoever is ever said about bitrate , and that as a caveat , know your bitrate etc . etc . Hence , I could only load 426 songs . This is Creative 's major error . Had I known about this , I would not have ordered a 2 GB player . SO , I have ordered a 4 GB player , and intend to send back the 2 GB player I originally ordered and received . ( SHAME ON CREATIVE FOR NOT STATING THIS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION ) . However , the player itself is good quality and performs quite well , and had some problems loading the software . But more info needs to be stated by Creative about the amount of songs that can be loaded based on bitrate ( Which most consmers know nothing about ) .  
2	  I think product is very easy to use . For some one that does not howto use the computer well should have no problem down loading picturesonce you get familiar with it  
2	  For those of us who are digitally challenged , this camera is really neat and user friendly . I recommend it to anyone looking for a new digital for recreational use .  
2	  When it comes to ink for my R1800 photo printer , I am concerned with the quality of the images I print . The Epson cyan UltraChrome Hi-Gloss ink cartridge provides superior resistance to water , fading and smudging . It is important to me that my prints are of high quality , so I don't attempt to use the cheaper compatible ink cartridges . The color can be duplicated , but all inks are not created equal . Third party options may produce a good print initially , but may not hold up or last as long . PROS : Provides superior resistance to water , fading and smudgingCONS : Price  
1	  Worked fine for about the first month or two , but has gradually gotten worse . I don't even try to print photographs anymore , and right now it 's barely printing out text documents . I don't use it that much , maybe once or twice a week , but it 's becoming pointless . I have run through all the diagnostic and cleaning functions - replaced the ink .. nothing is happening . oh well .  
2	  This turn table rocks ! I am going to be a DJ and it rock ! It sounds just as good as a cd player and is a cool turn table  
2	  The tape cartridges arrived as promised within the expected time-frame . All the cartriges were put into service successfully with no failures . We 've had to return some we 've ordered from others in the past , because the were unusable right out of the box . All six of these are hard at work !  
1	  I received it within 24 hours of my purchase and appreciate for quick free shipment from amazon . However , when I installed it into the PC that stopped working right now , I did not see anything on the monitor . I had previous memory installation experience and it was easy . The memory was in the right place with the tabs / nothces were put together so it was placed correctly . I rebooted the PC but nothing happened . I tried 3 times without any success . At that time , I had noticed that that memory stick was very hot . Then I called to PNY tech support # provided on the package and that person told me that that memory I received from amazon was defective and return to amazon . It was OK to return the item but I could not reboot my PC . He told me to removed the battery from PC and unplugged it for 2 + hours to reset it . I waited 3 hours and put everything back and turn it on . Nothing happened . I called again to PNY tech support and waited 45min and they suddenly cut the line . I tried again and waited another 45 min and they cut the line again ( I heard the ringing tone , then suddenly the line was cut off - twice ! ) . I cannot wait another hour to be cut off again . It seemed like they are avoiding my call and they already knew that new PNY memory caused my other memory sticked burned . I saw little burned on ( gold edges of the sticks ) both my old memory stick and new PNY I purchased from amazon . My PC was not only unimproved with this new PNY memory , but I also lost my existing good memory stick ( 125MB ) . This meory stick is pretty expensive and I chose brand name expecting for better quality as well as improvement for my PC but now , I even lost my good one and cannot use my PC . You can't tell any difference for this PNY stick until you actually installed into your PC . Don't buy PNY for their quality uncontrolled and poor thech support . The automated voice will tell you check the problems in their website . How one can check when the PC was not working ? You have to wait hours to pass automated voices to get live support and wait more hours to get the live person if you 're lucky . They don't hesitate to cut off your line anytime . Amazon should have negative stars and this PNY deserves neg stars . Update : my PC is not working anymore and not repairable . PNY tech support supervisor told me he had to deal with a couple of similar problems per month ( imagine how many people suffer the same problem with PNY 's defective items ) and nobody got compensation according to PNY policy . Never buy PNY products !

You have to wait hours to pass automated voices to get live support and wait more hours to get the live person if you 're lucky . They don't hesitate to cut off your line anytime . Amazon should have negative stars and this PNY deserves neg stars . Update : my PC is not working anymore and not repairable . PNY tech support supervisor told me he had to deal with a couple of similar problems per month ( imagine how many people suffer the same problem with PNY 's defective items ) and nobody got compensation according to PNY policy . Never buy PNY products !  
2	  I really like this wireless router . I just wish it had a longer range , I get a weak signal on the other side of the house .. maybe 35-40 feet .  
2	  We cannot write an extensive review at this time , as we only just received the camera a few days ago . But from intial trials , we can say it is much better than expectations . It is light , easy to use , and the first couple of rolls of film came out very promising . There is much to work with and explore with this camera , and I am sure we will enjoy the adventure . The first photos were crisp , clear , with nice images and true color . The autofocus is a big plus , but we shall also enjoy using the manual mode . To this camera , we added a 70-300mm sigma lens , and we are also using haze filters , and polarizing filters . It is a great camera for the money . Not a bad investment , and not too pricey , saving us money to invest on accessories .  
1	  I was on hold 50 minutes , 52 seconds before anybody answered . I heard " your call is important to us " at least 100 times , which wasn't very convincing .  
1	  Worked perfectly for 3 months but now has a humming sound that makes the headphones completely useless . Tried to return but am apparently outside of the return window .  
1	  Don't get this unit ! My friend was borrowing it and got a ticket and I just got another ticket with it . It alerted me after I had already seen the cop and started slowing down and my friend was never alerted . DON'T BUY !  
1	  i had this for around 3 months , 1 of the swithes is awful it never clicks into contact . now another one is getting bad . i am probably going to open it up and goto radioshack and have them help instal new swicthes . sadly i would not recommend this productthe seller i have no problems with .  
2	  this splitter works great and do think you will like it and if you need more than one order more than one at the price  
1	  Sony is currently the only manufacturer making DVD-RW camcorders and apparently they haven't perfected it . I bought mine for almost $ 1,000 and have had to send it to repair twice , sending it AGAIN as the finalized DVD 's all SKIP ! The DVD 's are also very expensive , only hold 25 minutes of video and although RW 's allow you to re-record you cannot edit out certain clips and record over those . I am truly disappointed to have bought such an expensive defective camera , and what 's worse is the terrible service I have received from Sony . They will not return my money , and will not give me a new camera . Recently I learned from an employee at another store that MANY customers return this model for the same skipping problem . Sony must be aware of this yet continues to con people out of their money . The most they can do for me is issue an " exchange " someone else 's defective camera .. and that 's not guaranteed .. so here we are 4 months later .. with a defective camera having missed out on precious family memories .. going through hassle , time & expense of continuing to have to contact Sony , ship back , test , retest etc . Save yourself the aggravation .. do NOT buy this product .  
2	  This HDTV has just been a revelation ! It 's our first plasma , and already we hardly know how we got along with out it ( from a quality entertainment standpoint ) . It 's the first major purchase of this sort we 've ever made through Amazon ( seller : Vann 's ) , and it all went quite smoothly .  
1	  i cannot , after double and triple checking and redoing everything , get it work and logitech-microsoft does not answer my e-mail pleas for help  
1	  Never could get this adapter to work ! Have used other brands of adapters with no problems , but this one just flat wouldn't work .  
2	  This is NOT a high-tech digital frame . It doesn't play MP3 's . It doesn't come with a remote . It simply reads your digital pictures from a card and displays them in a slide show mode . There 's an " on " button and an " off " button . There is no manual to read in order to learn how to operate your frame ( though it does come with a one-page instruction sheet ) . It 's great for your office desk when all you need to do is reach over and turn it on or off . If you want to display it in a difficult-to-reach location , or choreograph your pictures with music , then this is not the frame for you .  
2	  I 've had this camera for a bit over 4 years . It was with me in Hawaii , Peru , Germany , and all over California , Arizona , New Mexico , Utah . It took awesome pictures . When I printed out pics , people always asked me " and that little camera took these pics ? " . Yes ! The short-comings : there was always a delay in certain conditions , which I lost many good pics to . Sometimes the shutter only opened halfways , with me noticing only later when I downloaded the pics - pics lost forever ! Battery life was very very poor , drove me nuts . So now it finally died . Bought new battery , nothing , will return battery . I loved this little camera , despite its short-comings , it will be hard to replace with another compact .  
1	  Has a cracking sound whenever you move your head , doesn't hold charge very long , I do not recomemd you buy these headphones .  
2	  This is not my first Canon , I used them for years and they seem indestructible . I get this MP 450 from Amazon , before it get on the market , and just love it . It is a beautiful little thing , sleek and shiny in black and silver , white a nice adjustable LCD in full colour . This multifunction is quite small ( nice feature if you don't want to clutter your work space ) and it does everything his big sister do ( I had the huge mp 780 which I was not so found of ) . The MP 450 works nicely , smoothly and even faster . Scans and copies are sharp and clear , printing is crisp , it 's a real pleasure to use . Often one says it 's better to have a cartridge for each colour , I am not so sure : when one is empty , the others follow shortly after . I love having just 2 cartridges to watch and manage ( dealing with 4 or 5 , you 're always running at the shop unless you store a lot ) . By the way it is really a two ( 2 ) cartridges printer ( event though I read otherwise on some websites . Furthermore , every time you change one of these , you get a new head , ( that means sharp printing ) . But , even with that , the ink cost is quite low , a very important feature for me as I print a lot of text . It even " duplex print , so you use both side of paper . Furthermore , included are two high capacity cartridges , but I didn't compared theses the regular ones , or found any info on theses , but this is a nice little plus . Photo and colour printing are astounding , you can modify the setting to your own tastes . The software bundle is full of nice surprises , like Arcsoft photo suite , which reassemble a little to Photoshop but is far much easier to use ) , and two scanner utilities . So I am very glad to have wait for the MP 450 . And hope you 'll enjoy it as much as I do . Good luck !  
2	  I loved this nano , I mainly used it for sports and it was doing a great job . The ear phones wasn't durable enough with the sweeting while running , so I had to change them few times . But the ipod it self was perfect . I was confused between buying it and the shuffle . The only thing that didn't attract me to the shuffle is that you can't see your itunes files that you creats . ANd with the shuffle your bound by one list . Over all I love the nano but I like the practicality of the shuffle if I just want to jogg with it . I recommend the nano very much .  
1	  The build quality of this product seems to be amiss . The first Jukebox arrived with a bad hard drive . It was returned and the hard drive in the second Jukebox went bad 90 days later , with very little play and zero abuse , i.e. it never left the house , was never dropped , etc . Also , don't expect much in the way of volume , it is just not there . Based on 2 bad hard drives in 3 months , there is no way I can recommend to anyone they purchase this product .  
1	  Don't get this item ! It totally destroyed my disks , so I had to get new ones . Whoever made this junk should be totally ashamed of themselves !  
1	  Here are why - Most of files in my video libraries cannot be played on this player . It only supports very limited number of codecs . No plan to support real media in the future . - I bought it because I plan to use it as dvr . However , the supporting dvr station is not available on the market . Because of the above two reasons , it makes the player almost useless to me . Besides those , - it suser interface is not easy to navigate - there 's not protection skin on the market to protect the device . I am afraid of bringing it to gym ; it might fall and break . - the sound quality is not as good ad ipod , make it less desirable as music playerIf the dvr station is still not avalable in 2 weeks , you will see mine on ebay .  
1	  The video playback is good . The music player could be a lot more streamlined . Too many clicks to switch from shuffle to normal play , etc . The WI-FI is probably not worth the extra money . The browser isn't capable of much , and the touchscreen keyboard is a pain . Support from the manufacturer is pretty weak . I need to replace the screen . Pricing starts at $ 162.50 . That 's more than this mediocre player costs . The customer service guy acted like I was wasting his valuable time as he asked for my information . I would not recommend this unless you get it for a really , really low price . Not worth the trouble .  
1	  You camera will record audio better WITHOUT this microphone . Luckily I bought it locally and will be returning it .  
2	  Apple 80 GB iPod classic Silver ( 6th Generation ) It is good look and a wonderful gift for teenager .  
2	  But none properly fit the shiny screen on my Sony Vaio laptop ( I bought the filter for glare reduction - not privacy ) . If you have a sizing issue , you CAN buy a slightly over-sized filter and cut it down to fit . I did , and I 'm very happy with the result . I suggest buying a filter that is at least half an inch larger than screen width and height to make cutting easier . Understandably , 3M is a bit skitterish about cutting because one slip can ruin the filter . But the material is pretty easy to cut if you use care and FOLLOW THEIR DIRECTIONS . Glare is dramatically reduced . For some strange reason , cutting the filter voids the one year warranty - not a big deal as far as I 'm concerned . The only issue I have is the retention tabs that 3M provides . They 're a bit fussy to attach so they look good - and they have a shiny surface . Thankfully they 're not large , so the issue is somewhat moot . Amazon did a good job getting the filter to me quickly and in good condition .  
1	  Upon inserting the 20 pin connector into the motherboard , one of the wires came out of the connector . Ordered replacement but not thrilled with the fact that it will be from the same manufacturing run .  
2	  I had recently purchased these 12 inch Subs and they are every thing i was hoping for in a speaker . These speakers it hard you can feel bass all the way throw your body as you should . I highly recommended you get these 12s it does what it says and you cant beat the price on this . Well wreath it great investment if you ask me but you go out and you be the judge .  
2	  This is an excellent phone and we have been very pleased . The only thing disappointing was that I ordered this one after we had purchssed a base phone and two handsets . Not only had the price increased , but I was not allowed free shipping .  
1	  Poor sound quality . Does not come with docking adapters for all ipods , this should be standard when selling a product like this , it 's a 5 cent piece of plastic . Buttons on top are flat so hard to reach from bed and know what you are doing .  
1	  specs were great , so I decided to give at a try despite the warnings from others . Now I 'm returning it back . First , WinDVR won't install on my XP Pro system . In the very beginning of the installation it gives " remote procedure call failed " and aborts . MSI web site has the same faulty version . Intervideo doesn't want to deal with this issue , " If you need OEM ( bundled ) support for an Intervideo product , please contact the OEM for that information because we do not provide exhuastive support for OEM versions of the program " Ok , downloaded the latest version of WinDVR 3.0 . This one installs and seems to work . And what do I get from the MSI card ? - Just a beautiful blue screen on all channels .

2	  This is a perfect splitter . I measured my signal strength before and after installing , and did not see any signal loss . It is easy to install and feels like high quality . Two mounting screws are included . Very happy .  
2	  As good as the original . Right from the beginning , this battery has performed just as well as the Panasonic one that came with my camera .  
2	  I bought this since I use my iPod Mini on my Bose Sound Dock at home and wanted to listen to the songs in my vehicle . While it doesn't match up to the Sound Dock , it 's flawless in that I do not hear any static in the transmission . I live in Orange County in California and tried all presets on the Monster iCarPlay , except for one preset that had some static , three presets work just fine . It charges the iPod while in use , and when the ignition is turned off , it pauses the iPod 's current song playing and lets the iPod go into sleep mode . I recommend for anyone searching for an inexpensive , but reliable , way to play their iPod through the car 's FM stereo system .  
1	  The ear piece worked OK , but the microphone was terrible , and I cannot use this product . Be advised to not purchase it .  
2	  Got an ipod a few weeks ago . Software worked fine with WXP ( SP2 ) Device really easy to use . Took it on a trip to Argentina . Great on the airplanes . The right side of the earphones shipped with the unitdeveloped a buzzing sound after a week . Don't think itwas caused by misuse . I 'll try returning it to Compusafor a new unit . Problem is the earpieces . The neckstrap and ear piece cords tend to tangle easily . The on switch picks up dirt . But these are minorconcerns . Recommend the device highly . My laptop is dual boot ( WXP , Linux ) Under linuxyou can mount the device and see all the files .  
2	  Not the fanciest of cooling fans i have seen , but love it having 3 fans to cover the entire bottom of my laptop , and it does what it is designed to do , cool , and great price , and besides that , you can't see the cooling pad once the laptop is on it . I have a HP G 60 , which does hang over both side a bit , but you can feel the air blowing out to the edges . The only thing that i was not 100 % pleased about , is that the lover edge of my laptop does not catch the lip on the pad , but that is because when the battery that came with the laptop gave out , i replaced it with a heavy duty one , that is not flush with the bottom of the pc . It protrudes about an inch and is probably the culprit . But the laptop sits there just fine without sliding off the pad , and so can be lived with .  
2	  You need this , only if you don't have a pole already , or to mount your antenna anywhere . If flush to a wall the antenna sits straight , or flat if you will .  
1	  Apparently there 's some kind of driver incompatibility problem when trying to use an HP Cxi 820 printer , via this ( or any other ) conversion cable . I haven't been able to resolve it .  
2	  I purchased Streets & Trips with the GPS a few years ago and upgraded the software as it was available .. loved it . Then my GPS died , so I decided to give the Delorme ( with GPS ) a try . The Delorme software and GPS is so much better than Streets & Trips . It 's kind of like going from notepad to Word .  
2	  I had an Epson 785EPX photo printer and when it worked , the prints were beautiful . However , my printer heads were constantly clogging and I wasted tons of ink cleaning the heads all the time . The ink is not cheap . So , I started researching for a new photo printer . I chose the Canon line because they have a reputation for cheaper ink . I found this to be true when I purchased the Canon i250 to replace another Epson ink hog ( the 640 ) for my general printing . ( I keep one printer for general printing , one for photos ) The Canon ink cartridges ARE cheaper and last longer . After reading reviews on photo printers I decided between the Canon ip4000 and the ip6000d . The ip4000 got amazing reviews both from consumers and magazines . There weren't a lot of reviews on the ip6000d I suppose because it 's newer . I decided to risk buying the ip6000d anyways because I really wanted the media input slot for convenience . I 'm here to say the photos are AMAZING and of photo lab quality . I tested using the included Canon Photo Paper Pro and also my leftover Epson Premium Photo Glossy Paper . Both papers produced the same results . The printer unpacked and installed easily . For printing without the computer , the menu / LCD screen on the printer is intuitive and easy to use . For printing through the computer , the software program ' Easy Photo-Print ' stands by it 's name . A couple of mouse clicks and the perfect print came out . If it matters , my digital camera is a Kodak DX6490 . There are two things to watch for while setting up your ip6000d for the first time . Both have to do with loading paper into the cassette tray . Make sure you load the paper PRINT SIDE DOWN and watch out for the little plastic thingy that holds the paper in place . Mine broke off and the spring flew off who knows where . It still works but just moves around easily . Since I just got the printer today I can't comment on long term use or ink usage for sure . I 've printed about 10 4X6 's so far and 3 of the 6 tanks show a very slim line for usage .  
2	  I was a little skeptical when I purchase this item , because I saw 25FT HDMI cables going for $ 50-$120 in most stores . So I figured how could they make a working $ 6 25 ' HDMI cable . I took a chance in purchasing it since I figured $ 6 wouldn't kill me if it didn't work . Much to my surprise , I tried it out , and it does work . I could barely see any visible difference in reception between an expensive 6FT HDMI cable and this dirt cheap 25FT HDMI cable . I purchase this to extend the cable box reception to three of my children 's bedrooms , and I 'm using an HDMI splitter which is also helping to boost the signal . See .. HDMI Splitter 1x4 Ports 4 Port 1080P v1.3 HDTV 3D HD AudioThis combination works great ! If you have a system in which you want picture-perfect reception , than you 'll probably want to go with the store bought $ 120 HDMI cable . However , if you 're extending HDMI reception to an area which perfection is not a requirement , ( and for most children they don't care ) , than I recommend purchasing this cable .  
1	  As noted by others , there is a design flaw that results in the printer breaking when replacing the cartridge . Had it break after replacing cartridge a few times . DO NOT BUY .  
1	  I live in a remote area of IL and have a problem with radio reception from stations that primarily serve the Chicago area . My expectation was that the RadioShark2 would be able to receive radio signals better than any of my current radios . Unfortunately , the reception I receive from the RadioShark2 is not as good as many of the standard radios I currently use even with the optional use antenna wire attached . I would not recommend this product if improved reception is desired .  
1	  Doesn't work as advertised . Although it seems to work at first , if I leave my IPOD connected to the computer with this cable overnight , then when I come back my IPOD battery is completely dead . The apple cable works perfectly , but it doesn't retract like this one does .  
1	  We bought this TV from circuit city 11 months ago and were initially very pleased with the price and the picture quality . Last week the sound on the TV broke . We contacted Magnavox and were informed that the year warranty on the TV only covered parts and not labor . We were referred to an authorized Magnavox service center who then charged us $ 150.00 dollars just to diagnose the problem . We were then asked to pay another $ 200.00 dollars to have the repair done . Although this TV appeared to be good value for money when we bought it , all the recent expenses to get it working again have made it much more expensive . We looked into buying an extended warranty to avoid this happening again , but to buy another year warranty costs $ 200.00 which is outrageous considering we bought the television for $ 1300.00 . Quite honestly a product that has such a poor initial warranty ie no labor , just parts and only offers an extended warranty at an extortionate price suggests that Magnavox knows that its product is of poor quality and is liable to break . We will never buy a Magnvox product again and will always check the coverage of the warranty of any expensive electronic device that we buy in the future .  
2	  Great product very easy to install . All you need is internal Sata ports and then you quickly connect the product to your computer and have two aditional esata external ports . You need activate in the Setup boot of your computer , but be very carefull y you have Raid configuration because you need special definition otherwise you can lost you data . If you do not have Raid then only put on your sat ports and ready to work . I have connected two 1 Terabyte Western Digital with esata ports to my computer and know it is flying on time response .  
2	  This is a handy case for small digital slrs with medium to short lens . Nice pockets and zippers . Too bad that the strap is not beefier .  
1	  Ordered SB5101 . Dave Parkers will send you a SB5101U which does not have stand-by button . They just make it up , and use a SB5101 tag to hide SB5101U on the package . When you open the package , you will see it is SB5101U instead of SB5101 .  
2	  I purchased the Samsung Nexus 25 primarily for the XM radio capability and its inexpensive price . I paid about $ 30 from Sears after rebate . I liked the flexibility it gave me to be portable in the car and at home . And the MP3 player recording capability off of XM was only icing on the cake . I use it primarily as a car player now and so the use of the car kit is extremely important to me . I have to say that I 'm very pleased with its quality and reception . ( Even though I list the pros and cons , many of these concerns are about the NEXUS product itself and don't reflect the car kit adapter ) PROS : 1 ) Quality-wise it 's well built and installed easily in my car . I have an 99 Acura RL and the YA-CP200 's air vent connector clicked easily onto the vents in a convenient vent on my dash . The unit stays in place and I don't have any concerns about it sliding around or slipping out of the cradle as I drive . 2 ) Sound quality is great . Even though I could use the FM transmitter built into the base , I 've opted to use the cassette adapter and I get perfect sound . My sister has an XM receiver by a competitor and she uses the FM transmitter and when I ride with her , I hear a constant low hum in her broadcasts . I don't have that issue . I have an extra cord to deal with , but it concealed easily along side the dash so no discernible issues there . 3 ) Remote control capability helps with use in the car . Even though the Nexus is located in arm 's length reach on the dash , the car kit comes with it 's own separate remote control that allows me to control the unit with ease . The home base unit also comes with a remote so now I have two and can keep one in each location . The only problem is that sometimes I 'll take a corner and if I haven't secured the remote , it can end up in the foot well on the passenger side . That can be annoying . 4 ) I love the fact that I can record the XM broadcasts on the fly . When I 'm in my car and I go into a tunnel or an area where I can't get signal , the Nexus automatically switches over to MP3 mode and I can listen to my favorites until signal returns . To record a song is a simple push of a single button during broadcast . Works pretty effortlessly . CONS : 1 ) I already mentioned that the remote has a tendency to fly around the car if I don't secure it .. but that 's more my fault than it is a design problem with the unit . 2 ) The Nexus 25 receiver on it 's own can't receive the XM signal . There 's a separate XM module that plugs into the cradle behind the receiver that allows you to receive the signal . If I remove the XM module , then I can't get XM broadcasts . Considering the module is such a small thing , I don't understand why Samsung just didn't include the circuitry in the unit like in the Samsung Helix , the upgraded model . The Helix has the XM reception built into a single receiver unit so you can receive XM anywhere without having to plug the unit into a cradle with the module . I think Samsung was looking for different price points and it charges almost 4 times for the Helix as it does for the Nexus . Though I can understand why they 've done this , I think they 've done themselves a disservice . 3 ) The navigation on the receiver is a bit cumbersome and not very intuitive . I can get the job done , it just takes me a few more clicks than I would like especially considering that I 'm in my car and should be keeping my attention on the road . Once again a quip against the Nexus unit itself and not the car kit . Changing stations is not so simple and I haven't yet figured out how to save my favorite channels so I can go directly there .. I 'm sure there 's a way to do it , I just need to get my butt to pick up the manual and read it . 4 ) I have to reinstall the XM car antenna . I 've heard from a local XM radio installer that the magnets in the antenna cause rusting of the exterior paint and seem to mess up your paint job . So my sister ran her antenna wire around the inside of her windshield and uses velcro to attach the antenna to the windsheild behind her rear view mirror to help conceal it . Sounds like a good fix so I 'll be doing that in the near future . Overall , I think the Nexus 25 along with the car kit make a great addition to any vehicle !  
2	  I 've only had my iPod for a few days , but so far it 's great . The sound is wonderful and the interface is easy to use . The touch wheel is a bit sensitive .. I nearly rendered myself hearing impaired after accidentally turning the volume way up . I primarily use it at the gym and it 's nice and light . When I 'm running , I can use the clip it comes with to clip it to the machine , otherwise , I can clip it onto my shorts and it doesn't bother me at all . I had some problems installing , however . I 'm using windows XP and the cd that came with the ipod didn't have the most current software for formatting the ipod , whereas I had the newest version of iTunes already on my computer . After downloading the newest software updates , everything worked just fine .  
2	  I 'm a musician , so I use a lot of electronics . These headphones are very well constructed . Rich in sound , they provide the richest bass and mid-tones to resonate through your eardrums . Yea , I love music . These babies and my iPod .. I recommend them ..  
1	  I purchased this product four months ago , and I have had it replaced four times already . The first Visor Deluxe lasted two months , as did the second one ; the third one lasted three days . The device will simply freeze up during use , and resetting it does not work . Furthermore , Handspring cannot provide a reason for the malfunction . Although Handspring and Palm may share operating platforms , Handspring certainly has inferior hardware .  
1	  After two hours on the phone with customer service people with attitudes , I realized I bought a piece of junk and plan to order a brand new broadband router from another company . What a waste of my time and money . In a nutshell , this router did not work . All I wanted to do was hook up the router to one desk top and one laptop . The customer service rep , whom I could not hear because the line was breaking up because I guess it was overseas and I could not understand because of her heavy accent , told me I needed win zip to upgrade my router . When I told her I didn't have one , she said I should go to the computer store , buy Win Zip , and use it for the 30 day trial . I should download it on my laptop . Then I should return the software telling the store that I 'm not satisfied with it . I couldn't believe what I was hearing . I repeated it back to her , saying that she wanted me to buy software and return it because I needed it to upgrade my defective Linksys router ? Basically , she was asking me to lie and steal from a store ? She said yes , it 's not a big deal . I couldn't believe it . I will never buy another Linksys product again . Defective product and extremely unprofessional . I would have given zero stars if that was an option .  
1	  The output voltage on this Adapter is 6 volts , which would be very hard on any equipment expecting 3 volts input . As such , it is totally useless to me .  
1	  I 've had this player for about 6 weeks . The controls are abysmal . The player freezes up when trying to switch from radio mode to mp3 mode . I have to remove the battery to un-freeze it . Oddly enough , I 've noticed quite a few positive reviews for this player wherein the author actually noted the freeze-ups and yet still gave it a good review . ? The biggest nuisance is that when I put songs into the player , I have no idea how many are actually going to play . This morning I loaded about 50 songs on the drive . The player recognized 13 of them . Worse yet , several of the 13 songs weren't even songs that I had loaded . These songs had been deleted a few days ago . When I scan the drive with my computer , these ghost songs aren't even there , but yet they continue to play . All of these glitches have been there since day 1 . I would not recommend this item . Even at $ 17 , this player isn't worth it . Andrew  
2	  The sound is dynamic , not super bass-y . As an audiophile for super bass , these don't satisfy . The dynamics of the sound is very clear for easy listening . Another audiophile problem is that the it isn't very loud . Cranking it on my laptop is about natural hearing db . If you want the music louder for the experience , these won't do it . Also the dual cables for each speaker are thin and could break . No problems yet . These are comfortable and styling . The bass seems to improve over use , but the loudness isn't there .  
1	  I recieved the product as stated , and on time . BUT the ink just doesn't seem to be as crisp and bright as it should be coming out of a " new " sealed package . Not sure what is up with that . I think I will go back to my old supplier .  
2	  This item was just what I needed for my new pc here and it is agreat product with a good price . ThanksJames  
2	  I upgraded my PC to Windows Vista and I only had 1GB ( 2x512MB ) of RAM . My computer ran ok , but was a lot slower than with XP . I ordered this 2GB ( 2x1GB ) kit to replace the 1GB and it works great . Now I also have the option of adding 2 more GB if necessary since my PC has 4 memory slots . Can't go wrong with a name like PNY .  
2	  This item was received promptly and well packaged . Item works fine and is a quality item . Excellent service .  
2	  This bag may be only a little bigger than a magazine , but Domke is masters at conserving space . I am able to fit my Pen FT w / lens attached , plus 4 lenses and all the accessories easily . This bag even stands up on its own , probably because of the waxwear finish . First photo bag I 've been completely satisfied with . As others have stated on the other versions , you do need to use 2 hands to open it . The image for it above is terrible , it really looks much better in person , it 's really brown & sand colored .  
1	  The tape does not stick to smooth surfaces . I was trying to label plastic drawers and tool box drawers in my home shop . The labels fail to stick and fall off even when the surfaces are cleaned . I must apply contact cement to the label or put scotch tape over them to hold them in place . The labels are probably good to stick on paper but are not good for anything else ! Look for something better !  
2	  Recently bought this lens for a trip to Yellowstone . It performed quite well ; very intuitive , easy to handle , and easy to swap between my standard lens and this one on my Rebel T-2 . Managed to get some good shots of grizzlies and a black bear , as well as bison , etc . At times I wished I had gone with a longer lens , the bighorn sheep were quite a distance off , so a longer ( and more expensive ) lens would have been helpful . But , for general purpose , and portability ( which was one of my main criteria ) , I was more than satisfied . The optics are clear and focusing precise . It would be nice if they offered a hard case for the lens ; my old Tamron telezoom had a nice hardened foam lined leather case ; alas I could not find one for this so I substituted a Tamrac , nylon and foam case that worked adequately .  
1	  doesnt support slave drive 's only mastersdoesnt support x64 vista promise thinks there above everyone else too cool to make drivers  
1	  I must review this product step by step , just like is shown in the product details , I also have to say that I shuold look for reviews in cnet . com . I do regret I payed such money , they sound exactly like the cheap low quality you recieve in national flights .. Deep yet precise bass - ZERO BASSPassive noise isolation reduces ambient noise without batteries - ZERO NOISE ISOLATIONV-MASQUE driver delivers warm mids and crisp highs - THEY ARE NOT THAT CLEAR REGARDS SOUNDBLISS silicon tips in three sizes for maximum comfort - NO THAT COMFORTABLEAward-winning design in an array of colors - IRRELEVANT BECAUSE I CONSIDER MOST IMPORTANT THE PERFORMANCE  
1	  I bought one of these cute little players because of the recommendations off another MP3 site . When it arrived , the first thing I found out was that it wasn't that little or that cute . it looked more like a pager from 1982 . After 6 attempt at installing the software on my desktop computer I gave up and managed to install it on the laptop instead . That didn't help much in downloading songs to the player , it hung on the second song download every time . I had to buy an adapter for the CF card so that I could download songs directly to the card . Once I did get a few songs on the player its sound was OK , but no better than he Genoa MP3 CD I bought laster year . The last straw happened a few days later . I had attached the eGo to my belt while out running errands . I tuned the player off while I picking up a few items in a drugstore . On leaving the store I went to start the eGo but it wouldn't play . Due to a moronic design flaw , the Ego 's card slot is open and on the bottom of the player so when it was attached to the belt clip the CF card had fallen out and was lost . I gave the player one last shot and tried 2 of the 128mb cards I use for my digital camera but neither would play in the eGo . Apparently , the devise only support a very limited number of cards on the market . The only help I got from the company in response to several email about the software problems was , " Did you read our web site ? " My advise to you is find a player with a little more thought behind it .  
2	  This made installing an after-market radio in my car INCREDIBLY easy , literally just unplugged factory radio , and replaced with new radio . This piece is a must-have for extreme convenience !  
2	  it works great . nothing hard about it at all , just plug in and use . The only small , small down side is that the small mall blue led is not very visable . but it gets the job done .  
1	  It broke the first time I tried to use it . Should have realized you get what you pay for .. it broke at the top where it attaches from the mono pod to the bottom of the camera .  
1	  I found this dipole antenna to provide equal or worse reception when compared to the " in the box " wire antenna that came with my shelf stereo system .  
1	  I got this printer for school , and after the first few months , it would not print in color for more than 2 days after replacing the cartridge . Plus anytime you change a cartridge , it prints a test page that uses up a lot of ink . It 's loud , and would wake my roommate up in the mornings . The best thing about this printer is that it can provide great stress relief . At the end of the second year , I took it outside and beat it to a pulp with a hammer , along with a friend of mine who had problems with her printer , also an HP . Bottom line . HP printers are NOT worth the money .  
2	  I find this combo very comfortable ( as the name implies ) all in all it 's a nice keyboard I really believe comfort is of outmost importance , so after 10-20 years you can still move you 're wrists :) .. instead of one night of party you should really get you 're ergonomics right . What I don't like : - Changing batteries : this isn't THAT much of an issue but I would definitely recommend rechargeable batteries ( not only for you 're pocket but also to preserve our ecosystem ) which implies additional cost . - Cost : i feel the price is a little high , a generic keyboard and mouse ( which generally work very well ) will usually cost about $ 4-$10 of course they 're not ergonomic or cordless , but still it 's almost 10 times more , especially with the batteries .  
1	  The sound from these speakers is quite unimpressive . The volume level is very low . I wanted these so I could have my " B " speakers out on the deck , and my " A " speakers still playing in the house . These speakers are so much quieter than my stereo 's normal speakers , that it can't be done . In order to have adequate volume outside on these speakers , the volume would have to be set so the indoor speakers were blaring . So I have to turn off the " A " ( indoor ) speakers when I play these speakers outside since the volume has to be cranked up to get the same sound .  
2	  I needed something to hide the cables from my AV stuff after I wall mounted my TV and shelving . The cables looked terrible and were just hanging everywhere . This is the solution I wanted .. PROS : - Paintable ! Now , after I painted them to match the walls , they virtually disappear . - Sticky ! Other products I read about talk about how poor the tape on those products are . So far , this stuff sticks and won't let go ! Don't put it in the wrong place or you 'll be taking plaster off the walls when you remove it ! - Lots of options ! You get inside corners , outside corners , T-joints , 90 degree turns . Very flexible ! CONS : - Small . It holds about 3 or maybe 4 ( if they 're smaller ) cables . If you have a lot of cables , you may need to channels next to each other , or look for an alternate product ( Like the OmniMount CMK : [ .. ] . - Pricey if you need a lot . I only needed 1 kit so it wasn't too bad .  
2	  At the beginning , I personnaly thought it 's a bit expensive . Around $ 70 for a webcam ? It sounds too much , doesn't it . However , my friend who specilised in the PC hardware strongly suggested it to me and therefore I decided it to give it a try . The product is awesome ! All the friends who saw me in the new cam gave it excellent compliments . Pro : easy to carry and clip on the monitor or be placed on the stand ; perfect quality ; the software is very easy and convenient to use and entertaining ; Free carry-case to protect the camIt seamlessly works with Skype and supports the HD quality video communications . Cons : can't even think of one for now .  
1	  I bought this Digital Rebel XT ( 350D ) brand new over a year ago , and have cursed it often for ruining dozens of unrepeatable magic moments and what should have been " gallery quality " shots due to the INFERIOR design of this camera 's abominable " AUTO-FOCUS " system . " Back-focusing " is a major problem . Seems everything BEHIND your subject winds up being in perfect focus . This is especially frustrating since I replaced the cheap 18-55mm " kit " lens with an expensive Canon " L " series , 24-70 f2.8 macro-zoom lens . Unless you use the " creative-zone " and choose only the center area ( or point ) of the cross-shaped , seven area focus sensor , don't plan on getting a properly focused picture . Apparently Canon realized THERE 'S A PROBLEM with the EOS 350D 's focus system , because the new EOS 400D ( Rebel XTi ) comes with a different sensor ; it 's the same highly accurate , nine-point " diamond " shaped focus sensor that 's found on the considerably more expensive , professional grade EOS 30D . I 'm going to cut my losses and unload the 350D on ebay and hope the 400D I ordered yesterday from Amazon will give me the results I 'm looking for . My fingers are crossed ..  
2	  Ordered this cable with a gigabit switch . It works well with the new gigabit network . Data transfer between PC and NAS is significantly faster than 100 mbit switch . I didn't try the old cables with the gigabit switch . At less than $ 5 , why bother ?  
2	  This is a great battery . I don't notice any difference in the length of charge between this and the actual Cannon one that came with my camera . For the price , you can't go wrong .  
2	  Just what the doctor ordered for a great price . Worked as intended and received in record time . Would recommend to all .  
2	  What can you say about a cable ? Either it works or it doesn't . Mine works fine , and seems to be of good quality . I am most happy about the price . The same cable would have been a minimum of $ 30 at any brick-and-mortar store . I saved at least $ 20 by ordering on Amazon .  
2	  The eTrex Vista Garmin is a nice instrument , an elemental GPS and should be more usefull if we may have a software of certified maps for Colombia , S.A. unfortunatelly those are not available .  
1	  About 3 weeks into gaming I heard static on the right side of the headphones , a week later I could hear more static . Now I hear noting on the right side . The microphone is medicore in quality and I dont think I will ever purchase this headphone again but for $ 20 their isnt much too lose unless you buy yourself 3-4 for the year .. Sorry Plantronics I give you 1 Star ..  
1	  Customer / Technical Service Sucks ! TV Power and Remote control unreliablequote of message to Philips ) The purpose of this message is to file a FORMAL COMPLAINT for the mediocre service received from Philips first through the authorized service center and now from Philips Manufacturing System . Our first Plasma TV was bought back in Nov . 2.2006 . Early this year the Tv just went dead and after 2 week of waiting the technician diagnosed a sort of damaged Power Box . Since they were unable to get the part in back order it was finally decided to replace the TV for a brand new ( AFTER A WHOLE MONTH FOLLOWING THE TICKET OPENING DATE ) . On the second TV the Remote Control stop working right after the TV was installed . Now Philips Customer Service says that the Remote Control ( part 242254900635 ) will not be available until May . 15 ( OVER A MONTH AFTER THE SERVICE TICKET WAS OPENED ) . There are no words to describe the lack of manufacturing planning and poor customer service . Not to say that , if existent , this is a clear evidence of the poor performance of your Product Management Dept . While I receive the replacement part I will take time to file the obvious review on Philips in every single site dedicated to receive Customer Reviews ( CNET . , Yahoo Shopping , Amazon , Shopping . com , to mention a few ) Thank you for nothing . ( unquote )  
1	  Don't do it . I have one and it doesn't do half the things they claim . And HP just discontinued the printer and shipped the support over seas .  
2	  I purchased this keyboard in ' 07 and have used it paired with a mac mini as my main keyboard until last week . What I liked most about this keyboard was the look of it ; so vision of the future . . . from 1971 . Both the " titanium " two-tone color and the sleek curve where the keypad meets the dock area suggest a retro console look . The entire mouse dock / picture frame concept is absurd yet , in 1971 , could have ingenuously reflected the aesthetic of the space program crossed with minimalism ( . . . and the keyboard , you see , has a built-in stand for the mouse so that it is not left lying about on the desk . When the mouse is being used , a sliding panel can be moved to conceal the portal where the mouse had been docked and simultaneously reveal five useful buttons . Of course with the mouse in the dock , the entire apparatus becomes a picture frame and no one will even know you have a keyboard with a dock , a sliding panel , and five useful buttons . . . ) Years from now I believe Kensington will release documents proving that this keyboard was in fact designed in the seventies by Xerox . We 'll see . After three years of use in this century , however , I have discovered that this keyboard will function erratically if one spills a shot of J & auml ; ger on it . Sure it seems fine for a day or two but then one key becomes favored ( in this case it was the page down key ) and repeatedly and endlessly presses itself . I tried all the usual means of fixing a keyboard ; spraying it with tap water , pouring rubbing alcohol on it , smacking it repeatedly against a mattress to dry it out , but nothing helped . In fact , all this effort only made the right side of the keyboard , except for the ebullient page down key , unresponsive . I believe there are two lessons here . First ; it doesn't matter how much a keyboard looks like it was designed in the 70 's , it cannot tolerate hard alcohol and second ; sipping J & auml ; germeister , rather than swallowing the whole shot at once and setting down an empty glass , will ruin your life . Sure , you would think that knocking over a drink onto a keyboard is no big deal but when you have Snow Leopard set to automatically log you out after a few hours , and it will log you out , no amount of restarting will get you off of that logout screen and without a keyboard you cannot do anything ; no work , no internet , and , worst of all , no movies or iTunes to preserve one 's sanity in a building with residents that listen to KUOW at rockband volumes so yes , sipping J & auml ; ger can ruin a life ! RIP Kensington Ci70 Titanium Wireless-but I 'm keeping the picture of your girlfriend .  
2	  This item was purchased for a work event on a school bus that did not have a speaker system installed on it . It has a very fast setup and it even came pre-charged so we didn't have to fool with that on top of other preparations for the event . While larger models would work better and be louder than this , the portability and ability to use it on a moving school bus or even in the backyard without having to run an extension cord really makes this unit a dream . If you are looking to host a backyard birthday party or a pool party where you don't want to have wires running about , this is your item . It is made very well and I imagine we will be using it for years to come , in lieu of setting up a full-scale speaker system for smaller events .  
2	  Needed a new hard drive for my mom 's laptop as the old one was going out . This is the exact same model as the one that was originally in it , and it works just fine with Windows 7 running on it .  
2	  Product description was fine and I received it quickly . I am pleased with the purchase .  
1	  Got the product yesterday . Its not worth purchasing since it does not do its basic function right , that is to charge the device without making any humming noise . I plugged it into the device and I get a big humming noise making the device impossible to use . The USB slots are not aligned to the opening . Yet to try and charge the iPod in the car .  
1	  This is a nice combination of VCR and DVD and a great space saver . Unfortunately , 7 months after purchase , the DVD stopped opening and closing . Philips has a 91-day to 1-year warranty and will prorate the product for replacement . You send them the machine and a check and they send you a new one . Not good pricing on exchange , either .  
2	  Garmin eTrex Vista Handheld GPSBought it for a road bicycle , and I love it ! Bought it with the bicycle mount . Received it and started using it the same day . It has a million features , so it takes a bit of reading to setup all the options . Oh .. you have to buy MapSource to fully utilize the unit . I tried the cheaper method of uploading and downloading to the unit . Could not get to work with Google Earth Plus , I did get to work with other 3rd party software . But I finally coughed up the $ 100 bucks ( almost as much as the unit ) and bought MapSource North America . Now I was cooking was gas ! Uploading , downloading , mapping , graphing , analyzing my ride . It is incredible all the information that can be gleamed from the interface with MapSource . Now that I have used it for a bit , I love it even more . You can plan routes , or not . Use the tracks you created , later . The graphing on the altimeter is wild ! The maps are incredibly detailed . I could go on and on about all the features , for the price this unit is the BOMB.I had a sneaky suspicion that I might need to buy the software . So I chose the Vista . However , I am so pleased with the unit that I wish I had bought the colored more sensitive ( GPS wise ) higher end model .  
2	  This lens is great and BEST used outdoor . Don't bother using it inside unless you can provide it with enough light . For under $ 100 , this lens does extremely well .  
2	  Yes the 770sw guarantees a drop from 5 ft so I feel if I get shock proof reliability at 3 feet I 'm still ahead . Yes it says it is waterproof to 33 ft , well again , if I get caught in the rain with no damage then I feel it is well worth it .. is there another camera like this ? However .. While scuba diving near Marathon Key a few weeks ago , it slipped off my wrist / lanyard into 6 feet of water , into 1 ft high sea grasses . I was wrestling the BC off my back and simply forgot to get the camera safely off my wrist . I couldn't find it right then , panic . My boat was anchored and was sweeping at a 30 foot arch in the wind enough to activate the drift alarm so I GPS marked the spot and stabbed a spear gun into the sea floor roughly where I thought I needed to return . It was getting dark so knew I would have to return next day at first light to do a systematic search for it . Next morning we returned for I found a fellow to help me search . He splashed around for a while as I directed him from the boat . I became impatient and jumped in and swam where I thought the target area to look should be . And there it was . s you can imagine I was quite happy to have found it . I had a lot of pics oin it and it isn't the cheapest camera either . Now , I picked it up and turned it on and started a video right there in the water . It worked fine after sitting there over night . I have dropped it from table height too and it still works perfectly . I took it to a cold high mountain river in New Mexico and shot a little video under water last week just sticking my hand under for a few seconds . Still works just fine . It took breathtaking shots off of the Sandia Crest looking out at Albuquerque . Also , " breathtaking " because it was at over 10,000ft alt and I wasn't acclimated quite yet . I took the cable Tramway up there in the afternoon so I could catch a sunset then eat at the restaurant . I do that every time I go there . Fantastic view . The dinning was far better this time than back in 1974 .. then it was horrible . I 'm buying another one of these 770sw 's . I like it that much .  
2	  I 've had one of these for the past several years , using it on and off when wireless wasn't an option . It has served me well and I really like how compact and convenient it is to use . I find the build sufficient but nothing that couldn't be destroyed with a hard knock . When using it , one has to be sure that the cable isn't recoiling all twisted or else that would damage the auto-retract . I haven't had a problem with the retraction yet . I don't use the telephone adapter too often but in the rare cases that I needed it , I was very happy to have this product on hand . It saves me from carrying an extra cable and the telephone cable is sufficient for times when Ethernet isn't an option . The only thing I would want more from this product is a longer cable but I don't know how that would affect the size of the product . 6 ' is sufficient for most situations but I wouldn't mind an extra 4 ' or more . I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to carry around a phone / ethernet cable without the bulk / inconvenience of carrying the regular cables . It is functional and understand that it isn't built like a tank and it 'll serve you well as it has for me .  
2	  I 'm not going to get into why one would want this specific type of filter - there are books on the subject that will go into a lot more detail - here is one example - there are many : The Photographer 's Guide to Filters ( Photographers Guide ) . What I will review is quality of this product . B + W filters are made in Germany . Germany is consistenly one of the best producers of high end glass and optics . I have been told the reason the quality of these filters is better than most is that they don't make them as separate units , but instead they build a cylinder of glass and cut each filter off of it . Consistent quality . Screw ring is hard metal , so it is very difficult to strip the threads . I have messed up the threads on cheaper brands by accident . In my experience , buying filters falls into the category of you get what you pay for . Cheaper brands are out there , but if you want a very high quality filter , that is durable and consistent with what you want to achieve with it .. you can't go wrong with B + W filters . Be sure to choose the right size - for example , Nikon prints the size on the back of the lens cap .

2	  The harmony remote connects to a computer using a USB cable . You then install some software on the computer and then navigate to a web site ( harmonyremote . com ) to configure the remote control . All of the configuration is dependent on this web site . On one hand , this is good in that this web site should always have the latest device commands in its database . However , the drawback is that you have to contend with a web / HTML interface and the wait times associated with a web-based application . Personally I think it would have been better to have a normal installed Windows application that can receive updates on new supported devices over the internet . Configuring the remote was not that easy but was possible . Basically if you have fairly " well-behaved " and well supported devices with no special characteristics or requirements , their wizards should get the remote configured quickly . But .. if you have certain tweaks you want to make then navigating through their configuration pages can be frustrating . For example , if you want to add certain device commands to the list of commands sent when an activity button is pressed ( activity = " Watch a Movie " ) , then you have to navigate through their setup wizard for the activity and then , at the end , choose from one of the 3 responses which dumps you to a configuration page that finally allows you to add commands . This page should be accessible directly - but isn't . Ultimately , though , despite the poor configuration UI and web site , I was able to get this remote configured the way that I want . The end result was great . It is a very easy to use remote once its configured . One of the things I hate about many remotes is that you have to give guests a tutorial on how to use them so they can operate your entertainment system . With this remote , its pretty obvious what to do to watch a DVD or watch TV , etc . I did get my remote as a Christmas present and , yes , as the other reviewers stated , Logitech 's site was overwhelmed which resulted in some frustration . I got frequent " High Traffic " error messages when first trying to configure the remote . However , ultimately , I waited for times where the web site was not so overloaded and did manage to get the remote configured . Overall , I 'm pleased with the remote . The end result was good despite some hassle in getting it configured . Once you have found your way around their configuration web site , you can get the remote tweaked they way you want it . I 've never had a universal remote that didn't require a lot of time to get it completely setup and tweaked to work they way I want . So all in all , I wasn't too disappointed in that . Pros :* The remote is phsyically designed well . It can be operated easily with one hand . When back-lit , is bright and clear . The buttons are all easily pressed . * It uses " Activity " buttons that represent what you want to do .. " Watch TV " , " Watch a movie " , " Listen to music " . additionally , you can create your own custom activities and name them what you want . So a guest can pick up your remote and fairly easily figure out what button to press to do what they want . * The LCD screen has 6 positions with buttons for each position so that you can create custom commands associated with each activity or device . There is a " Next " button below this so that you can have multiple pages of these custom commands . * It supports " discrete " commands such as Power On and Power Off and " Go to Video 6 " , etc . This is really important for the remote to be able to function without making assumptions about what the current state of the devices are ( e.g. If a device is already on and it needs to have a device on for a given activity , it won't send a " Power toggle " and inadvertantly turn the device off . ) * You can control whether switching from one activity to another turns off the other unused devices . * You can specify if some devices should always be left on ( i.e. a cable box ) * You can add additional commands for any devices * It can learn any commands that it doesn't already know fairly easily . Cons * It relies on a web site and applications that are launched via the site to configure the remote . This means that you have a combination of web pages and downloaded applets that run when you need to update the remote . The result is a clunky interface that is inferior to a normal Windows app . For example , in a normal windows app , a wizard would let you simply press " ENTER " to next through the wizard but the HTML based web site requires you reposition your mouse every time over the next button to get through them . Generally I think web based apps are inferior to Windows apps . Even still , they could still make their web site easier to use . Its too indirect and too wizard - based . Wizards are ok for initial setup just to get things mostly configured , but when I need to go in and make tweaks and refine the configuration , I don't want wizards . I want something more straightforward . * One of my devices is a Sony Receiver . Its a model that is only about 3 years old but it didn't seem to be in their database . I had to learn the commands I needed with the original remote and head to head learning . Its a Sony - not some cheap off brand no one has heard of ! * Yes their web site was overwhelmed during the holidays - very frustrating * When you first take out their CD , you 're prompted to install their software . But as soon as you go to the web site to start configuring , it tells you there is updated software and you have to manually uninstall what you just installed ! It doesn't even do it for you or simply update what you have .  
1	  I bought this for my son 's 17 inch HP laptop and it doesn't fit . We were able to stretch the fabric over the laptop to make it zip but it was just too tight . He would not have been able to put anything else in the backpack because any additional space taken would not have allowed it to zip .  
1	  I bought two pairs of these about a year ago ( one for home , one for work ) , and since then both of them have broken . The first one had a wire break internally so that half the time only one headphone worked . Later , the joint connecting to the bridge snapped off near the working headphone . The second one now has a broken wire , but _ INSIDE _ the bridge ( how does that make sense ? ) . I still have the bridge component to the other one , so hopefully swapping it will give me one working pair of headphones and one very broken pair . Other than the durability issues , this is a great headset . For $ 80 , though , I expect things to last longer than a year . I give 2/5 stars because things that are broken dont even get a chance to be reviewed in the other areas .  
2	  an awesome keyboard for media center or if your computer is hooked to a lcd tv the keyboards touch pad is a great feature very accurate and precise mice control  
2	  I bought this to put a single DIN Alpine receiver in my 97 F150 and it worked great . Looks good and gives the console a finished look . I was easy to install if you can out in the radio you could surely install this . The only thing is the little trim piece wouldn't fit but I think its only supposed to be used on cars that need it . This install looks fine without it .  
2	  What can you say about a power adapter ? It works . It 's Casio , not a knock-off brand . There is nothing to fear , as long as it is the correct model number for what you need to power .  
1	  I 'm glad to see they 've dropped the price on this battery from $ 10 to $ 3.50 . They worked fine the first couple times I used them , but now they won't hold a charge at all . I just threw them away . Spend your money on something more reliable .  
2	  The inks work just as well as the Canon brand inks . I will continue to purchase .  
2	  I just bought a Celestron EQ130 and it 's a fantastic starter scope but only came with two lenses , a 20mm and a 10mm . I found myself in want of a greater selection . In particular , a low magnification lens with a wide field of view and a high magnification lens and barlow . This kit comes with all that and more and the quality seems to be decent . The filters seem to get the job done , I had a nice view of Jupiter last night and was able to use a filter to remove the glare and get some more detail . Considering the price of purchasing the pieces individually this is a great deal .  
1	  The earphones were ok . The noise cancelling was good but the sound of my music wasn't so great in these headphones . Before I had ear buds by Sony which were great but when I workout they tend to slip out . I thought getting these would be better plus cancel out all of the noise around . They actually were worse than my Sony ear buds . If you are someone that doesn't care about the sound of music and mainly need it for travel , it would be great for you . I just expected more out of them .  
2	  I have a similar version its t-23 2647-EU9 its generall the same maching . I got mine of ebay for 400 and its great . Not really any heating problems . Dont be scared of the track point its alot easier than touch pads once u spend about thirty minutes with it . It doesnt inhibit typing at all . I had problems on other laptops b / c when i would set my wrist down on the palm rest i would touch the touch pad and it would click somewhere in my text and i wouldn't notice it and that was very annoying . Great battery life even with the LCD turned onto bright . If you get it without drivers ibm has an updater you can download . i like the wireless internet , had a few problems saying it " couldn't start " but i just disabled it and shut down the computer and let it sit awhile then turn it on and enable it and it would work great . It has good connectivity . The must is to use the windows wireless program it beats out ibm 's program . has infrered for people with media cellphones . speakers point down from front of laptop , which projects into my lap and then into the computer where it makes it sound like music is comming out of the keyboard . But overall this is an awesome computer with an awesome keayboard ! i love it !  
2	  I think this is one of my best buy 's ever . Great tv at a great price . No Regrets . If you are thinking about buying this TV just do it you will not regret it .  
1	  I picked up one of these before a road trip though the midwest along with a car and house adaptors . I was attracted to the programming choices and lack of commercials . The service is great on a road trip far away from any major cities . I find I listen to the docked unit all day at work too . First the good points . The display is excellent . Shows up well in any lighting conditions . A real plus in a moving vehicle . It 's easy to " program " and as I 've read in other reviews the service is real good about using the same artist and song titles on all of the streams . This means that if you program it to alert you when a song comes on it will find it spelled the same whenever it plays . The terrestrial repeaters are great around a city where buildings can block signals . I 'm able to leave the antenna on the dash instead of the roof . The so so points . The audio quality through the FM transmitter is not impressive . There are only four frequencies to choose from and it turns out that in my city all of them have strong broadcast stations which sometimes bleed through . The bad points . This thing runs hot and is not small , about the size of a large paper back book . So moving it between your car and house / office requires a bag . Also the display on mine got scratched right away . I found that this device trips off my radar detector and interferes with UHF two way radios such as ham / FRS / GMRS . I suspect that the antenna system is bleeding lots of RF . The cradle is difficult to set the unit into . Has a very vague feeling to it . After about five months of moving it between car and office the antenna connector on the back of the received got damaged by the cradle . Now whenever I move it I need to use a tool to bend the connector back into place otherwise it won't seat properly an the antenna won't make contact . The range on the remote is only about four feet . Not enough for the home user . I think in the future I 'll look for an audio system with a permanent built in satellite receiver . Then I can leave this one in the home dock and stop moving it .  
2	  Pros : Easy to use , sharp screen , clear voice instructions and less expensive than other GPS units with comparable featuresCons : Needs more dynamic search capabilities for POI ( its a little too simple which is good and bad ) The Garmin C340 is a wonderful unit , I 've tested several other units such as the Navmans & Magellans , but the Garmin was the hands down winner . It has built in street level maps for both US and Canada - so there is no need to download detailed maps from your computer . In addition , the interface is a breeze to use - w / o even reading the manual I was able to get it up and running . The screen is razor sharp and the navigation controls are intuitive . Another bonus is that it has a built in rechargable battery , so you can walk around with it for a while or even program your next destination while you 're away from the car . I recommend this unit very highly - especially after reviewing the alternatives at this price point . - Update-Just an update because I 've taken my Garmin C340 to : 1 ) Toronto , Canada 2 ) Omaha , NE 3 ) Salt Lake City , UT 4 ) Denver , CO and 5 ) Seattle , WA . I have to say it worked wonderfully . It NEVER led me astray and got me to my destinations without any problems . This is a definite must have because it 's so compact and easy to program that it makes exploring new cities a breeze . Who needs to rent an expensive GPS unit from a rental car agency when you have the Garmin C340 with you !  
2	  This is a great and easy to use MP3 player . I only had problems getting playlist files to sync with it .  
1	  Radio works but the AC adapter is unavailable so forget about plugging this puppy in . It 's a pure portable .  
2	  Although the Garmin Nuvi 360 doesn't always go where I think it should , it gets me there . And if I stray off the path it wants to send me on , it recalculates quickly , almost as if it knows where I want to go . I bought the friction mountGarmin Portable Friction Mount for Garmin GPS Units ( 010-10306-00 ) which I like better than having it stuck on the windshield or rather permanently on the dashboard . Oh yes , you can pair it with your bluetooth-enabled phone and make and receive calls . Very cool . Most of the reviews for the model 350 have already said what I have to say , so there 's not much to add . You do get a free Audible book ( two " small " ones or one big one ) which you can listen to if while you travel . You are required to sign up for a trial Audible membership , but after you 've downloaded your book , you can cancel on-line . ( I bought Bill Bryson 's A Short History of Nearly Everything which I had already read , but want to re-visit ) . A Short History of Nearly EverythingIn sum , the Nuvi 360 is one of the coolest " toys " I 've ever owned . Just don't let it distract you too much . You won't be able to take your eyes off it , even though it speaks very well on its own . ( P.S. My wife and I agree that " Jack " is an easier voice to understand than " Jill " .  
2	  I said it could be better because the drivers refuse to work with Mozilla Firefox . Maybe Logitech has the same poor programmers as Microsoft because the software seems specific to Internet Explorer which is lame . Also I downloaded the latest version of the drivers and they still don't seem to care about any browser except IE . Logitech bundled musicmatch with this which serves no purpose to me because I like Winamp . Other than software screw ups the keyboard is good . The Keys are soft . The layout is normal unlike many other logitech keyboards that messed up the layout of the keys . It comes with a detachable wrist rest which is good . No PS / 2 to USB adapter incase anybody was wondering . Also the lights for caps lock etc are not well placed because the ones that are on illuminate the ones that are off . Overall this is a nice keyboard , can't say the same about Amazon . Once again Amazon has screw me over by sending my stuff in the largest box they could find . Amazon put this in a box so large that more than half the box was filled with crap filler and air . I use a package forwarding service to get my items so thanks to Amazon I had to pay double the shipping rates I calculated for . I will definitely buy more from Newegg from now on . You would think that Amazon would be nice to their loyal customers but they certainly aren't .  
1	  I ordered a 2GB memory card for a camera , and was kept in the loop on shipping , etc . However , I never got the package . I contacted ChiTek and was told to check with all my neighbors and the Post Office to see if it was mis-delivered . I did all that , no one had seen the package , and since the tracking code shows " delivered " ( to whom , I do not know , but certainly not to me ! ) , ChiTek says tough luck . Now I have to do a VISA chargeback over a lousy $ 22.43 order . Lucky it wasn't higher . With ChiTek 's lack of concern , I will certainly NEVER buy anything that comes from them again , and I advise each of you to consider this hassle before you do , too .  
2	  I don't know why I 've read so many negative reviews regarding this product , but I had it and the supporting PC card configured and working in 15 minutes , including the time it took to get it out of the box . The Linksys Wireless router ( ver 2 ) and PC card ( ver 3 ) on a Dell Notebook with Windows 2000 Professional is working just fine and all over my three story house .  
1	  Connections were loose inside .. so had to take cover off and inspect since it didn't come on after plugging in . Not as pictured . Foot is plastic not metal . Tires are thin and not substantial .. toy like junk . Didn't inspire that keeping this was going to go well . Returned it the next day . Bought a Sears Craftsman . Quality was better and it worked without fiddling or hasseling around .  
1	  I don't know what is the quality of the ordered item . The supplier mailed to me a cheap imitation of it ! Following my complaint , he ( and Amazon ) decided to credit my Visa w / o returning the item  
2	  It works great , used it to connect my home theater . It holds a lot of power , with no shortage of energy .  
2	  I purchased this lcd monitor on 04/15/03 and still going strong & with its 3yr warranty it 's a great purchase . The only problem that I had it is the power cord box that the monitor plugs into going to the wall outlet in which the manufacture replaced with Practically no questions asked . Thats all I had go wrong with it since I purchased it in 2003 . IT 'S STILL IN USE TODAY , NEVER HAD A BETTER LCD MONITOR THAN THIS ONE  
1	  Terrible product , don't waste your money . The photo quality is horrid even at the highest resolution setting and , if the batteries die ( which they did after just four hours ) , all of the photos are erased .  
1	  This din installation kit arrived broken on the left corner of the radio insert docking . It was probably broken before it was sent to me or it was broken in transit . Whichever was the case ? I am very disappointed because of the improper packing . Yes , I am glad to receive the item in efficient time . The proper packing should have been in a cardboard box with cushion for accident impacts . I do not know what to assume , but result is that I have to either pay $ 21.00 for new or try to repair it with super glue .  
2	  Excellent digital camera , superb optical zoom and image stabilization system . Easy operation , has a very clear ( and large ) LCD screen .  
2	  I would highly recommend the 75-822 for a Jeep owner . I recently took mine on a Jeep Jamboree and it worked perfectly . It is very small and light . It can be used as a handheld unit but can quickly be connected to your vehicle CB antenna for better reception and work off the vehicle battery . It is similar to the Cobra 75 WX ST but has the advantage that you can take it with you as a handheld when on foot hiking . Reception and transmission was excellent . In a Jeep with a soft top it is nice because you can quickly disconnect it and lock in the glove compartment .  
2	  The ad was not clear that this screws onto the end of the factory zoom lens with a reducing adaptor but that was OK once I tried it out . It does fisheye and wide angle as you zoom . It shoots about 180 degrees from 1 foot away . Clear sharp images . Does not darken the image .  
2	  This means I have tapes for a long time now and this will let me take movies of this christmas and put it on a DVD  
1	  I HAD THIS CAMERA FOR THREE MONTHS AND THE SCREEN CRACKED ! IT WAS IN A CASE ON MY DESK WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE CASE AND DISCOVERED THE CRACKED SCREEN , I CALLED CANON AND THE SERVICE REP . SAID I MUST HAVE DROPPED IT ! THEY WILL NOT FIX SO THE CAMERA HAS BEEN SITTING UNUSED FOR THE PAST 8 MONTHS . I HAVE SINCE GOTTEN A KODAK EASYSHARE AND I LOVE IT . THE CANON POWERSHOT IS NOW A PAPER WEIGHT . CYNTHIA IN FLORIDA  
1	  I thought these wipes would be safe and handy for my Macbook Pro , but they left an annoying film that was hard to remove !  
2	  It was worth the money , when I saw the cheap price I was a little skeptical but it was just what I needed it was shipped quicker then I thought it would be shipped . It worked to make my tv a high hd 1080 quality  
2	  Install the driver software , plug it into the USB port . Download How hard is that ? I use it for downloading pictures . It keeps the camera free for taking pictures . What more can you say , it 's about as exciting as a floppy disk drive ! BUT , it does what it was advertised to do !  
2	  I got this router specifically because it supports the Tomato firmware ( google for it , it 's free and open source ) . The firmware from Linksys / Cisco kinda sucks but the Tomato firmware makes managing multiple users with high bandwidth and low latency needs a breeze . It looks good and works great . I now run Skype calls while my housemate does torrents and the Skype signal sounds better , with lower latency than my phone line . This was not the case with my older Netgear WGT624 . Granted , this is after I spent some time configuring QoS . Again , the built-in firmware on this router sucks . Buy the router and install Tomato .  
2	  I finally converted to digital this month and immediately took it on a two week trip to Italy . Although the camera has plenty of options and adjustments available , the settings are easy to figure out and the small manual is understandable and is organized in a way to makes it easy to find the explanations needed . The photo quality is excellent and the anti shake technology really works , even with my 18-200 mm lens . I carried a spare charged battery since I seemed to use one up before I was finished taking photos .  
1	  When I bought this lens for my Canon 450D , I did not do enough research about the poor quality of Sigma lenses . My suggestion is to take a look at Canon 's 28mm EF and 35mm lens as possible alternatives to this lens . Like other reviewers my instance of this lens tends to focus in front of the subject I want and not on the subject . Thus , resulting in an out of focus / fuzzy picture . I 've been forced to manually focus this lens if I desire my subject to be in focus . This really reduces the number of photos I can take per given amount of time and the situations where I can use this lens .  
1	  $U$ have an ' 07 Honda Accord Coupe with an XM radio antenna . No matter what frequency I select I cannot get clear , static free reception . I 've tried every possible orientation of the device trying to align the transmitting antenna with the receiving antenna .  
1	  What arrived was a 256mb memory stick duo , had to return it and still awaiting right item  
2	  This is my second answering machine . The first one I had for 15 years and I hated it . It was so complex and tedious to operate , I thought they were all like that . So I was very skeptical and hesitant about getting a new one and looked for a long time . Then I saw the BLUE BEAN , read the operating descriptions and reviews and dared to order it . I LOVE IT ! Not only is it easy to program but once it 's set up the rest of the family can operate it without too much instruction . I can tell at a glance ( when I come in the house with my arms full of groceries ) whether there are any calls , and how many there are . The one-touch replay is great and the ability to delete an unwanted call with one touch as it plays , is a real convenience . And with an easy name like the BLUE BEAN I can remember the name to tell my friends . I 'm sold !  
1	  Don't buy this piece of garbage . Terrible quality . Not fun . Not educational . Just poorly made and worthless . It is a waste of money . I regret buying it .  
2	  We wanted to run a cable to use a DirecTV box in a different room - this cable did the job .  
1	  I ordered this switcher due to the fact it came with a remote and I don't have a HDTV and need a $ 100 + switcher . Starting to think I should have bought a more expensive model . The remote worked fine , but the box would cut the signal in and out intermittently . The signal would also sometimes vibrate . It didn't matter what device was sending the signal . Maybe I got a defective one , but I don't want to hassle with sending multiple switchers back and forth to see if I can get one that works all the time . Hopefully I will get a refund from Beach  
2	  I used to have a Griffin FM unit where you I had to carry a whole string of frequencies as songs to connect to an available station on your radio . The unit attached to my iPod and rarely worked very well . The Satechi connects very easily , at least initially , and streams my iPod content quite well , maintaining good quality . I imagine if you listened to rock it would be ideal . I listen to jazz and classical and my only complaint is that I have to turn the volume up totally to hear well . If the Satechi could boost the signal so the level was better , it would be ideal .  
1	  I don't normally give bad reviews except to warn people .. This lens does have great range but the poor corner to corner resolving power and low contrast make this lens a poor choice for just about every type of subject . In low light , back lit , or harsh lighting conditions like reflections off of cars , aircraft , or water etc , the lens wants to hunt for the proper focus to the point where after a full 60 secs of this lens trying to find its focus , I just switch to manual focus . The lens even stops responding altogether from time to time and the camera has to be shut off and the lens removed and then put back on to cure this . Also the lens is not sealed on , the body mount side and I have dust between elements that can not be cleaned without a complete disassemble . I can only speak of my EOS 20D but the other canon lenses I have exhibit none of these problems . I have been into photography for 40 years and I would have never considered a Tamron lens . This was my first Digital Camera and I let the Salesman sell me a Tamron POS .. Dont buy this lens if you plan on doing serious Photography it never fails to disappoint .  
2	  I have had this LCD for 4 months and I love it . I use it at least 8 hours a day , primarily for software development and business applications , and find it is very easy on the eyes . I run at the recommended resolution of 1024x768 60Hz and find text is sharp , the display is bright , and contrast is excellent . I also do a bit of gaming and Photoshop work and I am pleased with it in these roles as well . As an added bonus ( like other LCDs ) , it is silent , doesn't heat up my office , gave me back valuable desktop space , and is easy to move . The concealed cable tray and raise / tilt stand are also a nice touch . If you plan on spending any decent amount of time infront of a computer , do yourself a favor and buy one . It is money well spent .  
1	  Unpacked it , read the entire instruction booklet , followed the step by step procedure . Got the red light blinking on the transmitter , not too fast , not too slow . Moved on to setting up the speaker . Got a green light there and a little static for a moment , then nothing . I couldn't get a single peep out if it . I tried every possible adjustment , tried a headphone jack , tried the rca plug . Never , ever got it to work , I 'm very disappointed with this product and am returning it tomorrow .  
1	  I used films on two different types of Palm PDA before . Those were custom fit type . This one needs to be cut to size and very difficult to apply . The film is thinner than the ones I use for Palm . It is easier to tear and difficult to get rid of air bubbles . I use this on the LCD screen of a digital camera .  
1	  We tried for several days to get the nero software to operate with our dell laptop . We updated , filled out forms , read the reviews to get hints - nothing worked . It would play the sound ok , but the picture was a bunch of colored lines - ie , no picture . It was a hassle and I finally returned it . The problem was the included nero software , not the hardware - go figure .  
1	  I ordered this item and then 30 minutes later went to cancel the order because JR dot com has it for cheaper with faster shipping . I was then told I couldn't cancel the order because it had already entered the " shipping process " but wasn't to be delivered until 1/16/07 ! I was told that I could refuse delivery but I would be charged a restocking fee and return shipping charges and won't get a refund for another 14 days after they receive the item back . Do yourselves a favor and order this and everything else from any other place then Amazon . com . These people are incompetent dumbasses !  
1	  I wasted my money on these earphones because they won't stay in my ears even when I lie still - which is what I bought them for . I like to lie down and listen to a CD when I go to sleep , and regular headphones are bulky and uncomfortable . These would never work for any kind of exercise .  
1	  Got it for my new computer , along with an amd athlon x2 6000 + processor . Plugge it all in , no response . Tried everything to trubleshoot it , nothin . Could be a bad board or ios problem , because there is no post . Thats amd for you . my advice , by an intel board .  
1	  I hate to whine about these things , but I was sent a " refurbished " ipod and it was not refurbished . It showed up on its last leg and died about a week after using it twice . The apple store said it was never refurbished and said it was nothing more than an over sized paper weight . Amazon returned it no problem . Be careful , save yourself the hassle !

1	  There 's absolutely no reason to pay $ 27 for 100 bags , when you can just use the cheap clear plastic office wastebasket liners ( 7 to 10 gallon ) that sell for $ 18 for * 500 * at Costco , Sam 's Club , etc . I just finished a major shredding job with my Fellowes DMC12 , and used many of those .  
2	  Being an owner of the sr80 grado i already know the quality of their headphones so i expected great sound and i wasnt disappointed .. the headphones simply sound amazing .. period .. if you want style or maybe comfort adjustment than these cans may not be for you .. i would suggest you buy them from a dealer that can accept a return .. igrados are not for everyone .. just for those who appreciate great sound ..  
1	  I have been using this lock for a few months without changing the combination . Suddenly I could no longer open it as it appears that the lock has changed its combination by itself . I called engineering in the hotel I was staying in to help me . It took them less than a minute to cut the cable with ordinary pliers .  
2	  This remote worked as advertised . I needed a learning remote to use with a new Olevia HDTV , since other remotes have no codes for it . It was easy to use the learning feature and it worked perfectly with the various features of the TV and the cable box . The only thing I had a problem with was the programming for my combination DVD / VCR unit . It learned the VCR functions , but I cannot use it for the DVD functions . I would still highly recommend this reasonable priced remote .  
1	  I was indeed positively surprised by the quality and the power of the sound produced . However , after 1.5 year of use , the sounds is completely distorted . So durability has been a problem with those speakers . I now need to replace them and I am not sure I will buy the same brand .  
2	  Small , lighweight and sharp as a tack . This is a fine zoom lens for Pentax digital SLRs . Matched with the standard kit that comes with most Pentax digital SLRs and you have a smooth range of focal lengths from about 27mm to 300mm ( 35mm film equivalent ) . What else can I say ? I carry it with me all the time .  
1	  Although this camera has outstanding features , such as the ability to edit and crop photo 's within the camera itself , I am very disapointed and plan on returning it after just 2 days . Having much experience with digital camera 's , indoor shots are much too dark on auto mode . Keep away if you expect good pictures with the auto mode . Also , delay too great in between shots , and very prone to blury exposures . Not too certain why it got such " good " evaluation , perhaps because the outdoor shots were much better . I will try the Canon next .  
2	  I bought my son an I-pod video , after seeing all the troubles it had with picture files , I bought myself a ZUNE . It has great sound , very easy navigation and excellent compability with Windows . It is a little bigger than I-pod and the battery life has been a little shorter than I-pod in my experience . But all around , I am very happy with ZUNE and I think it is better than I-pod .  
1	  I asked for a double CD Jewel Case and got a triple . This is totally unsatisfactory to me and I like to know if I can get double CD Jewel cases from this source . Thank you . Karin Meier-Rottmann  
2	  Bought this for a cell phone and it works great no problems after 4 months  
1	  This review is not only for their Wireless-G Notebook Adaptor Model WPC54G , but also for their USB wireless PC adaptor . Linksys Technical Service is terrible , needed help today to hook up both of these new items . Their reps were rude , unknowledgeable , and one even hung up on me when he couldn't answer the questions . Both of these items are being returned tomorrow .. I 'd rather stay wireless than deal with this rude customer service .  
1	  I purchased this item for a Windows Vista Machine . There was no information regarding compatibility . It will work but you can only use the speakers to which it is attached . You can not use the pc speakers and the stereo speakers at the same time . You must first unplug the USB transceiver in order to use the pc speakers . Logitech has no updated drivers for Vista .  
2	  I 've had this radio for a few weeks , and I think I can give an accurate review now . This is my first time having satellite radio , and I love it ! The station selection is awesome , but I will not go there because I am not reviewing XM . The Inno is sized about the same as an iPod , and it is really sleek ( and slick for that matter . ) As this is intended for all around use ( car , home , and portable ) it is very adaptable . I think it is very neat that when sitting sideways on the dock the Inno automatically switches sideways so you can look at the screen face on . The pad adjusts as well , so everything is very logical . Some of the main features that are impressive are : - The recording capability-even if you are almost all the way through the song you can get the whole thing ! - The bookmark capability . You can bookmark an artist or a particular song and anytime that artist or song is playing on any station the Inno will let you know so you can switch over . - The ability to create a " favorites " list of stations . - The ability to display the current song / artist on any given station . - The option to have sports / stock tickers running that shows scores , etc , while listening to the radio . OK , there 's a ton of useful options . Really , I just love being able to listen to what I want on a very cool little " toy . " Having never owned a satellite radio before , I am not an " expert " and I 'm sure this has flaws , but don't point them out to me . I will likely not hear you because I will be plugged into my radio !  
2	  I used to have a sony 5MP camera and I decided to upgrade . I love this one ! The pictures are really clear and the shutter lag is no longer a problem . It is definitely worth the money !  
2	  I have many of these because is the best way to keep my photos organized . Be carefull with the ones that said G , because you will need an special folder .  
1	  I have over 200 CD on my computer that are in the WMA " Lossless " format . After several emails and finally a long distance call to Creative I find out that they do not support this format and can not help . They said that " maybe " if I gat a Codec from Microsoft that would help , but they could not tell me which one to get . The only reason to buy this product is b / c it is MS compliant and in theory should work better with XP and other applications . However , I have learned it is no more compliant then IPOD . Since this player is not fully MS compliant like they stated I am taking it back and going with the smaller and more ergonomic IPOD . Bottom line buy the IPOD it smaller and better !  
2	  This is better than my husband 's transmitter which really sucks . I bought two ( one for me and one for my husband ) . They are a lot cheaper now . Fast turn time , too .  
1	  I bought these from a neighborhood Walgreens , and not only the sound sucks , the earbuds are not comfortable . They 'll scratch the inside if your ear , you could end up with an ear infection . Either get Sony or Bose , much better sound , earbuds are comfortable , and actually fits in your ear !  
2	  easy to use , but i don't know the function of it . may be i can find it in my photos  
2	  easy to use , but i don't know the function of it . may be i can find it in my photos  
2	  You can't beat the quality for the price . I 'm sure there is a difference between this cable and the $ 100 ones , but I can't see it .  
1	  I had bad luck with this product . I found the setup process easy enough , but the box was not very reliable . Ever few days it would lock-up for some unknown reason . I had to power cycle the box to make it work again . I 've now replaced it with an equivalent Linksys 802.11g router box which has been problem-free .  
2	  If you want a cheap , yet great sounding , headphones . Buy these , they are much better than my previous headphones .  
1	  I bought this laptop because of its reliability ratings in Consumer Reports . Everything works fine except when going on-line . As most have experienced , the laptop freezes up . I have tried with just battery , with AC on before I turn it on , with wireless off and on , it makes no difference and it is frustrating to no end . I end up shutting the laptop off and sometimes it actually works right the next time . I cannot imagine why Toshiba does not offer a fix to its customers instead of giving them lip service . I wouldn't buy another Toshiba if my life depended on it .  
2	  It is a patch cable and it works . Fast and reliable delivery at a reasonable price . Would purchase again . I like to keep my data cables blue to distinguish them from my phone cables . Was not disappointed .  
2	  This remote works as intended with my 5D MkII . I use it instead of a cable release ( which I have as a back-up ) . The infrared receiver on the camera is next to the lens on one side so the remote has a very limited angle in which it will work , but that 's not the fault of the remote . I like the switch on the remote to turn it off , on , or set to delayed release . The RC1 has one irritating design flaw : it has no opening by which to attach a lanyard ; instead it has a clip-on thing which covers the button and switch and has two slots you are supposed to thread your camera strap through then snap the remote on and off of that . I didn't trust it to stay snapped on , it 's on the strap getting knocked around all the time and out in the elements . Plus it 's worthless to someone like me who 99 % of the time doesn't use a camera strap at all because it 's in the way and getting hung-up on things . Without being able to attach the remote to a lanyard during a shoot I was constantly searching for my remote .. which pocket did I put it in ? where did I set it down ? I solved the problem by customizing the cover which snaps on the top and bottom ends of the remote so that the top slot is an opening for a lanyard at the bottom of the remote . I carefully cut the cover apart ( with a very small-toothed saw ) just below the top strap slot opening . I put a drop of Gorilla Glue on the top clip and snapped it into the bottom spot so the slot protrudes out the bottom and a lanyard can be attached . It doesn't look nice but it 's very functional and permeant and basically works the way it should have been designed in the first place . So , now I have my remote on a lanyard around my neck , I can reach the front of the camera to activate the shutter and also put it in any pocket and quickly know exactly where it is at all times . I 'll never misplace it or walk away without it .  
1	  The player worked fine - until the power connector inside the player became loose 3 weeks after the 90-day warranty expiration .  
1	  I would like to reiterate what some of the other reviewers have said . THERE IS NO SUPPORT FOR THIS PRODUCT . Polaroid does not support and it says so in the instruction manual . They say to contact Digital Media Group which no longer exists . Once I got someone at Polaroid that knew anything about it , he said there is still some help on the Digital Media Group website [ .. ] . Of course , when I tried that website it no longer exists . The player worked fine for a while , although , awkward and not user friendly . Then one day I turn it on and it shows a message that says " Cannot access HDD data " . That 's it . It 's broke and I have no way of getting it fixed . I have read some reviews that say the hard drive just goes bad one day . That is probably what happened to mine . I have taken very good care of it and actually didn't use it that much . There is no reason it should have stopped working . Don't buy this thing no matter what . The price is enticing but you will end up buying another one anyway and then spend twice as much .  
2	  If I had fair hair , I probably would have let it slide . But I have almost-black hair , so when it sprouts on my face , even a couple ones , they 're quite noticeable . Well , the bane of middle-age for a lot of ladies is new growths of fuzz on the face ( particularly above and beside the lips and on the cheeks ) . I have three things t hat I use to groom away the hirsuteness-an epilator that tears out the longer hairs , a tweezer for the fine ones , and this one for general use ( especially good when I 'm in a hurry and can't tweeze ) . I use this all over-chin , cheeks , forehead , eyebrow line , neck strays , between eyebrows , as needed . I have ubersensitive skin , so I use an anti-redness moisturizer afterwards to soothe , but this groomer only offers minor irritation compared to other shavers I 've tried . A very good , easy to use , not loud product . Nice . Essential for this middle-aged gal . I 'm about to buy a back-up . Note : Even if you don't mind some hairs on your face , but you 're someone who loves to use a full makeup-ie , foundation , powder blush , powder , etc-using this first makes the makeup look so much nicer and smoother . I always use this before a big event when I want the makeup to look really good and smooth .  
1	  Never worked right from the start it has a short in the audio plugs I was very disappointed in this buy I would not recommend this product to anyone  
1	  I dislike netgear for several problems : 1 . It doesn't allow me to access yahoo or hotmail for weird reason . 2 . Bad customer service . 3 . Hard to configure .  
2	  I received the DVD Xpress DX2 about 2 months ago , and it took a few weeks to get everything together to get it to work on Vista . Had to reinstall about 5 times as everything had to be done in the exact order . I am not able to use the direct to DVD feature , but that 's fine as I want to be able to edit the videos I use too . Now that I have it installed , it works great , and I 'm sure will work better once I get the hang of it . I 'm primarily using this to convert all of my VHS tapes to DVD , and so far it is working very well .  
1	  Although these people advertise their product as a " Canon " cable , show an actual " Canon " cable photo , complete with the " Canon " part number ; what they send to you is some generic junk cable . I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this cable . I complained to Amazon about this vendor running a deceptive ad , but to date nothing has been done and their " Canon " ad is still running . So if you are looking for an actual " Canon " cable you had better shop with a different vendor , because you will not be getting one here . Andrew  
1	  Not a good product , I lost the cap , believing in this product and this cap costed 23 $ to me . I have Canon Pro1 and the cap can be ordered only from Canon  
2	  The Belkin adapter worked flawlessly . I just plugged it in , then Windows XP found the driver , and off it ran .  
2	  A great bag with all the protection you would want for your gear . Would be a little tight for two bodies and all the related gear . Quality construction throughout . Amazon gave great service again and the bag arrived in a timely manner . I would definitely buy this bag again .  
2	  This replacement unit was installed in less than five minutes . The sound quality is on par with the original unit it replaced . Price , delivery time and packaging were first rate .  
2	  I love these headphones . My whole family shares our 2 pair , so now I 'm buying more , plus two for my elderly parents . By the way , people in our family have big ears AND wear glasses with our headphones . They are plenty comfortable . They only hurt if you wear them backward . There is a right and wrong way to use these . :) I use mine mainly for audiobooks , at home , in the garden , in my car , shopping , and on airplanes .  
2	  These speakers have made my home so pleasant - instead of listening to the radio all the time , I am able to listen to my Pandora or LastFM . Sometimes they have some static , but overall the sound is great , and I 'm very happy with them . Not able to turn them ON with the remote , but otherwise it works for volume control and turning off . Totally worth the money , especially when the other internet radios can be at least $ 100 more .  
1	  The Garmin company is awful . If you buy from them , you will most likely have to deal with their Customer Sevice Dept . Good luck ! They act like they are too big to worry about a consumer . They sell out-dated maps ( over 1 1/2 years old ) in their units , and expect the customer to spend $ 70 more to update the map in a brand new unit ! What good is a GPS that doesn't know some of the roads exist ? The customer service department says , " oh well most people are ok with old maps " . I will not own a Garmin , I would rather be lost !  
1	  It does not work . This the first time that I have ever purchased anything from Amazon , and I was not pleased with the product . I found out that this item did not work too late after the deadline to return it . I placed it in my camcorder a few days after it arrived . I tried to work my camcorder , and nothing happened .  
2	  Before I bought this PDA , I researched and researched and found this to be the most complelling product for its price . Although after I purchased it , the stylus fell apart and the stylus holder also fell apart , I was lucky enough to be able to fix the stylus holder but the stylus was repaired with a needle that I stuck in between , signaling the need for another stylus . But other than that fault , and a few crashes of the operating system , this PDA was awesome . It has a nice sleek design and works well . The metal cover provides extra protection for the times that you might drop the PDA , on the carpet that is . The only other thing I found wrong with it , was the cradle and Power cord . The PDA had to be connected to the cradle for power and is hard to hold while docked . Anyways , overall this product is great and I would recommend it to anyone who needs to have an organizer that will last them for years .  
1	  The disk was cracked when I received it and te cable didn't fit to my printer ; therefore , it was a total waste of money .  
1	  I have had this camcorder for almost 1 year . It suddenly stopped working a few days ago without any clue . We bought it for our baby , the videos were still in it and we don't know how to get them out of it . We called Sony and they don't care about it at all . My baby 's birthday party is coming , and we may have to buy a new one . So when you think about buying it , please be careful with its reliability .  
2	  It works , it 's fast . It was delivered on time . What else can I say ?  
1	  Some quick observations on this product now that mine has had a hard drive crash . 1 . This thing has a hard drive rather then flash memory . I only learned about its sensitivity after mine crashed . As the help desk told me ( after the fact ) don't use it for exercise or any thing else that could jostle it while playing . 2 . The display screen scratch 's easily making even more difficult to read then it normally is . 3 . There is no back lighting on the display . 4 . If it goes out of warrenty they will repair ( replace ) for $ 100 . I talked them down to $ 80 but am having second thoughts as to spending good money after bad . Does it really meet my requirements ? 5 . The device is ok if you are a passive listener . We used ours on a month long trip to Costa Rica and really enjoyed it . I would not recomend the unit for anyone who might use it while they actually move .  
1	  I invested quite a bit in storage boxes like these , some with fancy wood paneling and pull-out drawers . But they all had the same fatal flaw-slots . The pictured Atlantic storage box holds 45 CDs , as many as I 've frequently collected in two months . Even if you decide to use such a box for holding the CDs of , say , just one artist-Frank Sinatra-they 're equally problematic . I would need three of these to hold my Sinatra CD collection . Moreover , if I don't alphabetize or organize them in some way-chronologically , for example-I still won't be able to go instantly to the CD I 'm looking for . And here 's where the problem lies : every time you add a new CD to box , you have to refile the entire collection because of those darn slots . Moreover , due to the slight warpage of jewel cases over time , they can be a real nuisance to re-fit to those very same slots . Forget about trying to saw the slots out of the plastic . I tried that . All of my slotted storage devices have gone into the garbage . Even plain shoeboxes are an infinitely better bet .  
2	  HAHAHAHAHA GUYS , YOU CAN GET THIS FOR LIKE 70 DOLLARS AT WALMART , AND IT LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME , WORKS THE SAME , AND PLAYS THE SAME ! I was stunned when I saw the high price on here !  
2	  Not much to add to the other great reviews , except to say that I 've had this lens for over a year , and it never fails to produce razor sharp photos . I 've used it for photographing cars , mounted on a tripod and stopped down to 5.6 , and the results are just stunning . There are some excellent comparisons to the 85 f1.2 / L out there , and while the L lens is just the slightest bit sharper it 's hard for a non-professional such as myself to justify the additional $ 1300.00 . If this focal length suits your needs , don't hesitate . It really is one of the best lenses out there , and the price makes it a bargain .  
2	  I got this used and really just needed the charger . But I got the palm and a keyboard and leather case and the charger . So I just started using this one . I use it as a pocket size Kendal and download ebooks to it . For $ 20 a great buy .  
1	  Nice power supply number , nice price , nice features , died less than a week . Lucky for me amazon gave me a full refund no questions asked , and i bought me a nice power supply from hec , aka compucase . This is the power supply i bought , practicly the same price , way better product over all . New HEC Xpower Pro 650W Power Supply High Energy Power With Low Ripple Noise Super Quiet Technology  
2	  I purchased the printer in October and have used it sporadically until now ( early December ) . I have yet to replace the ink cartridges , which means it has easily printed a couple hundred pages . For a portable printer , it 's hard to get better than this . The printer is reasonably fast , installation was a breeze , and aside from being a little bulky , it 's the perfect road-warrior companion . The battery feature is fantastic and thus far hasn't presented any problems . I used the reviews by others on this product to make my decision and unlike those that rated the product low , I has zero problems with the driver installation ( just popped in the CD and was ready in a few minutes ) but remember to have or purchase a USB cord if you don't already have one . I also haven't changed the printer settings and haven't had any ink problems but haven't printed photos . My feeling is that if you want to print photos , you should get a photo printer . Finally , by a little bulky , I mean that it is a bit thick but it still fits in my briefbag with my laptop and all the cords but that 's all that will fit in there .  
2	  This system has got the goods and the bads just as I expected them to be . I 'll put things pointwise : - Value for money ! - Can't get a system as complete as this [ with the control pod cum decoder .. etc . ] for 25000 Indian Rupees . - The Sub " booms " - mind you , this one won't give you a tight punchy articulate bass . If there 's an explosion in the movie you 're watching you 'll hear and feel it alright but don't expect bass strings to sound resolved on this Sub . I 'll like to discuss this matter in a little detail : The older model z680 had a 8 inch woofer as compared to the 10 incher on this one , but the power has remained the same - 188 watts . Now subwoofer construction is a complex subject , especially when you are considering a 10 inch woofer . Most PC speaker systems have about 6 inch woofers . One can expect to push that to 8 inches . But frankly making a 10 inch woofer and making it sound articulate is in my opinion beyond a company that specialises in computer peripherals . Secondly , the notorious shortcoming of Subwoofer-Satellite systems is the lack of coherence between the Subwoofer and Satellites . The bass and highs are taken care of but the midrange suffers . Now this shortcoming will only be exaggerated when the woofer size is increased from 8 to 10 inches making it even more difficult to bridge this gap between the low and high frequencies . Thirdly , a 10 inch woofer will take more than 188 watts to be properly controlled . Most 10 inch woofers are powered by 250 watts or more . Logitech having enjoyed good success with z680 have pushed the envelope by replacing a 8 inch woofer by a 10 incher . I think this effort should have been directed elsewhere . An excellent solution is what Klipsch [ A speaker specialist ] has done - used 2 8 inch woofers instead of 1 10 incher . This solves 2 problems : one is that such a woofer would in some ways be easier to make . Secondly , with a single woofer room interactions can get very problematic causing booming at some frequencies . Infact room interactions are an almost incurable disease in the subwoofer breed . The only satisfactory solution is to have more than 1 woofer ! But all in all the sub is alright . It gives a good visceral impact . the bass output is kinda variable . At times is excessive but sometimes you gotta turn it up . - The control pod is fine . The signal decoding works without a glitch . - No complains regarding the Remote . The good thing about the remote is that the button layout is simple and feel of the buttons is good . - About the satellites - well nothing much to say about them . They are above average in terms of sonic clarity . Construction is good . - Although the other reviewers have mentioned that this system is loud enough to scare you neighbour , I beg to differ . It gets loud but not so loud . A related point is that there is absolutely no distortion at max volume - indeed commendable . But is the max volume deliberately kept low so as to avoid distortion ? Anybody 's guess ! Overall I 'm happy with the system - be it movies or music . [ I 'm not a gamer ] . There are no serious flaws . It has the shortcomings that most sub / sat systems have . A point of improvement would be the subwoofer . I guess logitech should toughen up the woofer [ now that they are committed to 10 in woofers ! ] . It vibrates quite a deal and need more bracing and more power . Guess that 'll be it .  
1	  In August , my girlfriend and I purchased this 30 " . The tv since that date has dealt with the screen periodically blacking out , while the sound stays on - it also has a cut on the screen from the inside of the glass ( over . 25 " in length ) , obviously from the manufacturer . Phillips , for the past four months , first sent us to an incompetent repair center to fix the blacking out issue . Their first attempt at fixing it did not work - but since Phillips could not find another repair service in a 50 mile radius to fix the problem ( all other reps noted that Phillips will not reimburse for full travel and working time ) , they asked us to send it back to this rep - their comments were that if it was not fixable by this time , we are viable for a replacement unit . The service center attempted to fix it the second time ( incidentally , this service repair center ' lost ' our brand new flat screen tv for 2 days ) , but the problem persisted . Phillips refused to send a replacement , or issue a refund ( after over two weeks of discussion ) , and offered a new , 3rd repair center that was more competent and now services san francisco . This 3rd rep came out to preview the system , noticed the issues , and said they would return to pick up the TV unit for repair . However , in a week they called to tell me that Phillips will not support our warranty anymore , since it 's past 90 days . I contacted Phillips , spoke again to their Consumers Relations department , who noted this time that they do not issue refunds or replacements for any of their products , regardless if it is shipped faulty . They noted that the blacking out is repairable under warranty , but the Screen cut is not covered under any warranty - regardless if it comes faulty from the manufacturer , it cannot be replaced other than by our expense . They have noted that the 3rd Repair service should be calling me , as they have authorized fixing the blacked out part of the screen . This final issue alone took one month , and 6 phone calls . For 4 months I 've had to deal with Phillips - and I have been cordial , lenient , and understanding . I 've agreed to 2 repairs , the second knowing that they were poor service reps . I 've been on the phone with them over 20 times , with mixed information .. and it 's still not fixed .  
1	  At first glance , this camcorder looks fantastic : it records in HD , it has a massive 3.5 " LCD display , a focus wheel , a microphone jack , good still image recording , and a sizeable hard drive . Unfortunately I cannot recommend it because Sony has decided to use AVCHD , a new recording format that is , so far , compatible with nothing other than Sony 's rudimentary included software . The " most useful " review of this product said that this January , many programs ( Final Cut Pro , iMovie , Premiere , etc ) would begin to support AVCHD . It is now March and nothing has happened , and it may not happen for a very long time ( if at all ) because AVCHD is intended largely for consumers who do not plan on editing their video . If this includes you , then go ahead and buy the camera . You can burn your raw footage to a DVD easily . But if you plan on editing then don't buy this camera . For good HD-quality video , look at some of Sony 's HDV cameras ( like the HDR-HC3 ) or Canon 's HV10 . They are all cheaper than this and you can start editing high definition footage right away . For more serious filmmakers this camera is a joke . It will just frustrate you .  
2	  The package arrived the second day after I ordered it . This drive came with everything that was needed . I did have to open the manual-big deal . I 'm running it on WinXP SP2 and it works fine . It 's a necessary evil because new PCs don't come with floppy drives .  
2	  If u r like me u hate having to mess with computer network settings and using new software to make your pc accessories work . I have 2 pcs that use 1 printer . I simply installed my printer driver on both pcs , plugged both printer cables from my pcs to this switch box , a cable from swi box to printer , and it 's DONE ! One pc uses button " A " and the other uses button " B " . U can switch on the fly . Super easy and very basic . Great for someone who wants to do this the simplistic way and not spend so much money .  
1	  PRODUCT IS GREAT BUT THERE IS PLASTIC OVER THE MENU SECTION WHICH CAUSES DIFFICULTY IN USING IT . I HAD TO CUT IT OUT .. PROBLEM SOLVED . U WOULD THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TESTED IT .  
1	  This device looks good , has a nice feel but just doesn't compare to a Pronto . Tech support from Logitech is just okay , they don't get back to you with 2nd or 3rd level support . 1st level can't really answer many questions at all . I have issues with the remote being able to turn on the correct devices for the various activities I like to use with my home theater . Macro capabilities don't really exist and for any serious home theater aficionados this device just doesn't cut the mustard . It is a good universal remote with some extra features not offered by the typical universal but it 's not worth the additional price . If you are a serious home theater user get a Pronto .  
1	  Bought two of these in August 2009 , one is still sluggin along but the other died without any indications of problems . Its dead to the world and nothing will bring it back . Now I 'm worried about the other one .  
2	  Zune 30 GB Digital Media Player ( Brown ) I bought a 30G Zune a year ago and loved the way I could have my music , pictures and videos with me always . I am a mother of 4 and a grandma of eight so I have LOTS of pics and flicks . I have about 1900 songs , 40 videos , and 212 pictures on my Zune right now with 14G to go . Two other family members bought Zunes through the year and it made it so nice to wirelessly share pictures with each other that I bought three more this Christmas as gifts for my husband , son , and sister . We are now a 6 Zune family and growing . We all love them and plan on buying more as the grandkids get older .  
1	  I bought the Rio S30s at Costco . I intended to use it at the fitness center and while riding my bike for exercise . It is small and light . It 's not big and bulky like a CD or tape player . It appeared the better deal over the S35s because you could simply use a larger SD card that are really dropping in price . The memory difference of 64mb wasn't worth [ $ ] , which is the only noticable difference between the two . The Rio software loaded on WinXP with no problem . It was functional and easy to use . The sound from the sample mp3 's was terrific . The earpieces fit on great and the sound from them was smooth , unlike info from other reviews I 've read . The opening for the battery and SD card wasn't as tight as it should be , however , the belt clip held it in place when fitted . So why did I rate this only Two Stars ? BECAUSE THE FM TUNER DELIVERED NOTHING BUT STATIC . You need the FM Tuner to listen to the TV in fitness centers . What were they thinking when they threw a SPORTS mp3 player on the market with a junk radio ? ..  
2	  My wife ordered the Bose headphones ( she travels a lot more than I do ) , and I decided to try the less expensive ones for me . We tried both sets today in the house , standing near a whole house fan running on low in the hall . The Philips headphones cut a little noise just by putting them on , but not much . There is a noticeable difference when you switch them on . We switched them off and on a few times , and took them off and on a few times . On the box they say " active noise canceling " , and " 75 % less external noise " . The Bose headphones cut as much noise just by putting them on , but still switched off , as the Philips did when we had them switched on . When the Bose were switched on , the noise was almost totally eliminated . We went back and forth between the two headphones a few times to make sure . The Bose definitely provide something extra for the increased cost . The Philips do a decent job , considering they cost about 1/8th as much . But if you need nearly total silence , you 'll have to spring for the more expensive set .  
1	  on my last trip my friend had one she bought on the plane and it worked great . I bought this one recently , went overseas and it did not work .. then came back and found out that the return window had expired .. so basically paid for something that didn't work and can't even get my money back on top of the huge inconvenience given I hadn't brought with many the many adapters I used to carry with me .. very , very unhappy !  
2	  These binoculars are the nicest and clearest field glasses I ever looked through . I only rated them four stars because of the fact they are not waterproof . I took them to Alaska and they were wonderful . We took them to the top of White pass and in the light snow these were wonderful . The moisture at those heights did not hurt them . While the 22x zoom was a concern to us that we would not be able to hold them steady , we were pleased to find that these binoculars are clear and easy to hold . We had a lot of WOWS ! using these binoculars . The light gains were also amazing . I am planning on using them this deer hunting season and expect great results . As to affordability , these are a great purchase .  
2	  I recieved this scanner as a gift last Christmas and have not experienced any problems with it . Almost all of the scanning I do is photo 's for the web to send to friends and family and this scanner has given me excellent results . Recently I purchased Photoshop Elements and have been scanning at higher resolution for editing purposes and the scanner has been perfect . I 've never had or used a scanner before this so I can't compare it to any others but coming from a true beginner I would say that if you just want a fun scanner that 's easy to use and produces great scans of photo 's you 'll love this one .  
1	  We bought this a year ago and all was ok until now . I have some DVDs that I have played in this before and now they won't play . The audio plays but not the video . The disk plays on other machines so it 's ok . I called Zenith but they couldn't help me .  
1	  This unit has a great sound and a cool design but my battery died after a year - it no longer holds ANY charge and you can't replace it . I suggest using the boomtube that takes AA batteries . My unit now only works if it is plugged in - kinda defeats the purpose .  
2	  An excellent starter HDTV . It is not what one would describe as a " big screen TV " but for those of us who don't want a giant appliance in their living room , this Toshiba takes up very little space and delivers a great picture . Just know that if you don't have HD cable or satellite , it isn't going to look much different from your old set ( aside from the aspect ratio ) . Still , we all know that soon all TV will be in high definition , and regular non-HD TVs will be irrelevent . This is a good transition TV because it will keep up with technology , and it won't cost that much more than a regular TV ( at least on amazon . com ) . I give it 5 stars not because it is the best HDTV , but because for what it is , a low-priced transition TV , it is excellent .  
2	  The bag is quite large , and can easily hold a 17 inch laptop , plus much much more . Seems like it 's durable enough . The only downside is perhaps it weight , though I don't find that too much of a problem .  
1	  I was anxious about this remote when it hit the market . I was waiting monthes to buy it and turn a cluster of remotes into one nice touchscreen . I also bought the remote for use with Z-WAVE lighting controllers I bought . WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT ! The software ( web page ) you use to program this thing is absolutely horrible ! I create web applications on my spare time , and to create a web app that is used to program a remote is a VERY BAD IDEA . Logitech 's programming software is so buggy its not even funny . Not to mention using static web services to program this thing is just a bad idea .. I spent countless hours programming and reprogramming my remote , because the settings wouldn't take . On top of that you cant add a ZWAVE device ( which is supposed to be easy compatibility ) without buying a remote for every ZWAVE device you own and teaching the harmony to use it , even though the devices are in the database . Its a big disappoint as many features advertised , just simply arent there , or " dont work yet " ? Yet ? Then why put it on the market ! ? I agree with the guy above , someone should get fired at logitech .. What a shame a nice remote with pathetic programming , sort of like a beautiful child with bad parents .. Buy it if you like to gamble and waste 500 !  
2	  I own the mini duffel bag ( black ) . It is my favorite bag to carry around with me to the gym , at work , or for leisure around the city . It 's small enough for a purse and deep / wide enough to fit my shoes . It has cool compartments for my ipod , my cell phone , my camera , pens and make up bag . There 's also a zipper compartment in the front . The material is long-lasting and the dimensions are GREAT ! I highly recommend this bag and will probably get this bag for my friends as gifts !  
2	  I love the way this product allows me to listen to my tunes without disturbing my spouse :) What a great idea ! I have bought many items from The Unwind Company and have always been extremely satisfied .  
2	  Ok so this is a REALLY good player yes it is ! For the fact that its big ? No way .. it fits perfectly in the hand and all the buttons are friendly and easy to reach . It has a really friendly design . I bought one and when I got it , I was amazed .. All you do is install software , restart computer , plug in USB cable then plus it also to the player , plug in rechargeable battery then plug it in the player , start computer and start dragging and dropping Mp3 files . And erasing is SO easy .. you go in the drive that says PocketZip then right-click and go DELETE and thats it .. you cannot beat that . And plus it works with Windows 95 ( The only problem I had is that the screen was a bit black in the back and so I gave it back but it was just something that you just exchange it and that 's it Anywayz .. the HipZip is THE ONE and hopefully the 100mb pocket zip discs will be good with this one ( LETS HOOPE ! ) Til then , 40 mb is enough if youre like me and want to get a small amount of songs then change whenever you want in 1 to 5 minutes max ( or more if you have a hard time picking wich songs will suit your mood ) Anywayz .. hope this helped .. bye now  
2	  Well-priced , quickly shipped microphone has made my skyping experience much better than before . Plugs right in and works beautifully . Before people could barely hear me ; now , they say the sound is strong and clear .  
2	  This card works with the LG VX8600 mobile phone . No extra steps or anything needed , just put it in and ready to sync up music with computer .  
1	  By Netgear 's own admission , this card is not fully PCI compliant because it is unwilling to share an IRQ . This works with Windows 9x if you know how to tell Windows to not share IRQ 's with this card . You will also need to manually change one of the driver settings from " Auto " to " Fully Asychronous " to achieve full speed . This card will not work at all with the Windows 2K / XP hardware abstraction layer ( HAL ) because the new HAL does not permit overriding IRQ settings . Therefore , the most you will get out of this card with IRQ sharing is about 100 bps ( far from the rated 100,000,000 bps ) . You might as well use your old RS-232 port . I had to throw all of my and my companies cards out .  
2	  Great ! Love the text-to-speech feature . Compact ; fits in my purse . Works unplugged long enough for most trips . I just sit it on the dash or console . Get one !  
1	  Described as " brand new . " Was likely reconditioned . Was not to original specifications . We build custom machinery and put a UPS on each machine . These units were scrapped out at the customer location ( export ) and replaced with APC units from authorized distributors . My bad for looking to save a buck .  
1	  I had such high expectations for this product . I was looking for a product that would allow me to listen to the music on my pc throughout my house . What I got was a huge disappointment . The first strike against this product is that you cannot use your PC speakers when you are using the transmitter . I read a lot of product descriptions on different websites , and not one of them mentioned this " feature " . So , as soon as you switch to the transmitter , you need to replace your speakers with a FM radio right next to your computer . Another huge disappointment with this product was the range . I was able to pick up the signal on a radio that was a couple of feet away from the transmitter , but that 's it . The radio in the next room could not find the signal . A FM Clock Radio that we have couldn't pick up the signal even when it was placed right next to the transmitter . My stereo system one room away was able to pick up the signal for a few minutes , and then lost it . I tried several different frequencies , including available frequencies at the low , middle , and high end of the range . They all performed equally poorly . Setup and installation were very easy . The interface for changing the broadcast frequency is very simple and easy to use , but unfortunately , this product is a turd .  
1	  The item that Amazon has pictured is model # 1183 . Model # 1181 is the same as model # 1178 . The only difference is that model # 1181 , includes the technical data printed in french and english . Model # 1178 is printed in english only . This may explain why the description states " Canada Only " . Why pay the extra cost to receive the owner 's manual in french and english . I have pointed this error out to Amazon , but it appears they 're not willing to correct their error . Model # 1183 , which Amazon has pictured , has the additional feature of FM radio . The buyer would not be aware of this issue unless they had research the manufacturer 's web site . Buy model # 1178 instead and avoid the nightmare of trying to explain to Amazon that they are at fault . Since I purchased this item through a thrid party seller recommended by Amazon , I won't burden you with details of what they 're asking me to do to return for a refund ! Just avoid this item all together !  
1	  I usually buy Fuji CD-R media , which are made at the Taiyo Yuden factory and have never failed me . I couldn't find Fuji media at my local $ - mart , but I figured that Sony media had to be about as good . Instead I learned yet again that if a brand has a contract with $ - mart , it usually means that they are simply stamping their name on cheap junk . These Sony disks use inferior and unstable phthalocyanine dyes . The quality control is terrible . Even at low recording speeds my Plextor and Lite-on drives often report recording errors ( aka : coasters ) . In contrast , Taiyo Yuden disks use AZO dyes , burn great , and never seem to go bad over time . ( Naturally , you should protect any CD-R media from high temperatures / sunlight ) . PS : If you have Nero software , start up CD-DVD speed and select " Disk Info .. " This will tell you the origin and dye type for your CD or DVD !  
2	  love it .. simply put .. have gone through several / lost . Have not lost this one yet . Well rounded firm tip for touchscreen . Pen is decent as well . I ended up going with the black / grey . Use it daily for notes / drawing . have not came across an app yet where it did not function as described .  
2	  I bought this extra memory as the Nikon Coolpix S10 camera comes with 1GB card . For videos and photos this 1GB is too little .  
2	  This product is great . It secures the Zune tightly to my arm , never comes loose , and stays clean .  
2	  I recently purchased the Microsoft wireless mouse and have been very pleased with its performance . It is an especially good value for the money .  
1	  I just got this memory card , it is like my 5th or 6th SD card ( 1st 8GB ) and it is the only one that every time I plug to my computer the pics I saved on it disappear . It is also the first card in which my computer says there is an error with a picture and therefore it will not save . I thought there was a problem with my camera , but I did the same process ( copy and paste ) to another media and all the pics " pasted " to the USB with no error .  
1	  I love this TV ! I own two 50 " , and one 42 " .. I was trying to order another 42 " . What I absolutely HATE is this company . Amazon claims there 's a glitch in their system which won't allow me to leave feedback for this company , so this is my only means of doing so . Here 's the story : First , understand that my wife and I have been Amazon customers for over 2 years . After 15 days of waiting , 9 phone calls to LCDMART , and 3 phone calls to Amazon , I finally cancelled the order for my plasma screen through Amazon . The SAME day I cancelled the order , I FINALLY received a call from LCDMART and the representative told me that I 'd receive my TV within 3 business days , and that he was emailing me a tracking number . He claimed that Amazon takes 10 business days to submit orders to his company .. from experience , I find that very hard to believe . I waited until the following day , and not having received my tracking number , I called yet again , and was told by John at LCDMART that he was emailing me a tracking number immediately . I did not receive it , so I called YET AGAIN , and was told that I would not receive a tracking number until the following day . I asked " How can I receive the TV by tomorrow if you don't have a tracking number today ? " I then asked when I would receive the TV . I was told , " I don't know . " I asked to cancel my order , and the representative for LCDMART said , " No . I can't cancel your order . " I repeat , he said , " NO ! " After a few choice words , and my persistent demand that my order be cancelled , he put me on hold , then told me my order was cancelled . This company is doing Amazon a great disservice , and is damaging its reputation . LCDMART did not return a single phone message , or email inquiry . I 'm sure LCDMART will find some reason to make me look like an unreasonable customer , but read the reviews .. I 'm not the first to experience this , and this " feedback bug " appears to have been in effect since 5/2007 , so NO feedback , negative or positive , has been submitted to this company since then . Buy the product , you 'll be happy . Just don't use LCDMART .  
2	  Amazing speaker . I bought this sub because of the other reviews from buyers and they are all true . I installed it in less than 30 minutes , it sounds great and I can't turn it up over minimum due to an apartment setting . Of course , I intend to use it to its full potential soon , but for right now I will have to mention that it is sufficient for my needs even at 1/4 volume . If I turn it up past that I have to worry about knocking stuff off of the neighbors ' walls . Probably one of the best purchases in value for money . In short - buy this sub , you will love it .  
2	  I was really surprised to find that this was really made of leather and actualy works . The pouch is a good idea for the remote and wall plug accessories . As there isnt really any good handle for the IM7 , I am very happy to have purchased the harness .  
1	  This garage door alarm works , but wont shut off when the door is closed . Tech support wont answer your calls for help . Update , tech support did return my phone call and told me I could send the unit in to them for repair at my exspence . Thanks but no Thanks SKY LINE . Do Not buy this defective product . Buyer BEWARE . Amazon did replace it once but the second one does the same thing .  
2	  I have a few DVD players . I have no idea why I have so many . I have more DVD players than TV 's at this point . But the Philips DVP642 is by far my favorite right now . The Divx playback is very nice and sound quality is great . One little odd bonus is the fact that the player will play back SOME xvid encoded files ? I have no idea why but it plays SOME xvid files . Out of 10 xvid files , 5 played fine . I am not going to complain . The only reason anyone will buy this thing is for the Divx playback . So far , it 's doing a great job on that end . If you watch divx movies at all , get this player .  
2	  It installed without a hitch by following the simple instructions . It is working reliably . And I operate it with a Macintosh , Safari .  
1	  This antenna didn't do much for us - it worked slightly better than our rabbit ears . It pulled in the signals less than 6 miles away but couldn't do much with those 6 + , which is similar to rabbit ears .  
2	  This was a great buy . Really happy with the picture , sound , and ease of use . Size is perfect and as good as anything else we saw but much better price .  
1	  This was the worst camera ! The installation was easy , but most are . THE PICTURE QUALITY IS [ bad ] ! PLEASE dont waste your money on this , I am going to try the 4000 model tomorrow , so I will come back and give a review on that as well . I 'm hoping the CCD on the 4000 will improve the quality .  
1	  I wasn't even in the market for a speaker dock but found this on sale and couldn't resist . In the beginning the iWake worked perfectly my only gripe was the remote not working efficiently . Then out of the blue the unit completely stopped working ! I replaced the batteries and the a / c adapter and neither worked . My advice is to forego buying this unit at all . It was a waste of my money and I bought it on sale !  
1	  I ordered this cable specifically because it was WHITE . It has WHITE in the name of the product . The image looks white . The cable isn't . Its grey . There are lots of " white " things around it like thepacking slip that clearly are justified to be white . So I 've been mislead and am not very happy ..  
1	  not much more then a toy .. very small .. runs only on battries and they lasy only 45 mins or less ! I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING AT ALL ..  
1	  We received ours at the beginning of december . It worked fine until the beginning of april until it died . Totally dead in only 4 MONTHS . Contacted Philips and their best offer is we pay to ship the broken one back and an extra $ 30 + and we can receive a refurbished replacement . We paid more for the name expecting it to outlast our cheapo Apex that lasted 3 + YEARS . Too bad we didn't get what we paid for . Now we 'll just apply that " replacement cost " towards a ( hopefully ) better brand .  
2	  The mighty 1200 will live on forever ! Yes , it does sound better than any CD player out there .  
1	  I bought two of these for Christmas ' 03 . Both stop working when you take them outside in the winter . You get a high pitched screech and they die . I have another problem with one and have been trying to send it back for repair since August 3rd it is now Aug 24th . Weeks of e-mails and phone calls and I finally get two numbers to call and fax . I do this and find both have been disconnected . Finally today I get another e-mail saying you 'd be better off buying a new one since it is out of warranty . My feeling is they have no service capability . I would never buy another product from this company .  
2	  Gread player . Had August release and updated the Firmware as described in the CYBERHOME Website . The player reads VCD , SVCD and DVD just fine . ( Using also CD-R and CD-RW disks ) Also MP3 are a pleasure , together with the JPG slideshow module , add the Integrated 5.1 DTS decoder , PAL / NTSC conversion .. GREAT Deal . .. However , I did not get it to play MiniDVD 's . Maybe a future firmware upgrade will solve this ? Clearly recommend itRomain  
2	  I run a webcomic and needed a way to scan in pictures quickly and correctly eliminating all of my eraser marks . After some research and a look at where to store it I settled on my CanoScan . I ordered and received it , simple set up , literal plug and play with the USB port . I was up and running in three minutes flat . The scans for my black and whites are perfect and are done in record time . The scans of images are with little white dots on them , but a shrinking of the picture to a realistic size quickly eliminates that . I 've worked with a number of scanners and am thoroughly impressed by this one for its scan time ( usually less than 30 seconds ) , and its incredibly small size . If you 're looking for a scanner for a limited workspace , or scanning images for relatives , this is your product .  
2	  i first ordered the wrong enclosure ( ata ) but got excellent help from the supplier and shortly received the correct ( sata ) enclosure that worked perfecly .  
1	  This is a terrible product . The AC adaptor died 9 months after I bought the product . The people at the call center barely spoke English . When I e-mailed the company their response was that I would need to buy a new AC adaptor and sent me a link to their accessories department . The AC adaptor is no longer for sale , and Western Digital is not willing to replace the product . They do not stand by their own products and they do not care about customer satisfaction .  
1	  I had my unit for a year and the plastic hinge broke . I recommend getting and using the optional leather carrying case at all times because it helps protect the hinge somewhat . My hinge broke after a day I was carrying around my gps unit but didn't have my leather case with me . However I think the hinge started getting more loose after about 9 months of use because the flip cover started falling off my pda occaisionaly after about 9 months of use . Even when using the leather case you 'll still want to use the flip cover . The leather case is softer and if you don't have the flip cover on inside the case there a good chace your unit 's on button will get pressed on inside your pocket and the pda battery will get drained . The flip case is more rigid and it helps prevent the on button from accidently getting turned on while you are carring the pda inside the leather case .  
1	  Great features for the price . Image quality is so-so but is as advertised . It worked great when using a wired connection . When I tried to connect using my AirportExtreme it was a no go . I tried everything . Removing security . Renaming the network . All I got was a flashing yellow light which makes trouble shooting pretty hard . Panasonic support tried to help but nothing worked . It is being returned .  
1	  The setup program located my wireless B network , but could never find the range expander . So I turned off WEP , and auto-configured by pressing the " auto " button on the range expander . I got a solid blue light , indicating that it had connected . But when I moved the device to a more distant part of my network ( once again with solid blue light on ) , the broadcast signal was no stronger than when the device was disconnected . I can only assume that it was not working . I do not know for sure , because debugging is impossible . The only feedback the device gives is the little light that is either red or blue .  
2	  No issues here . I have purchased this item several times . I know there will always be defective ones , but I have never had an issue with amazon doing returns .  
1	  It says mac compatible . It did not have mac driver in the box and directed me to their website to download it which wasn't convenient for that computer . Then I found I still could not get the camera to work with the computer . By that time , it was too late to return it . Uhh ! The only thing I could do with it , was to display a picture briefly on the television .  
1	  Should be zero stars . Like many other people , my drive failed within months of purchase . I chose this product because of its RAID capability , which turned out to be moot as the device lost its partition - so the redundant drive was meaningless . Now to deal with their warranty service . They want the UPC off the box - from 6 months ago ! Sure , I keep every freaking box for everything I buy - I just had to move all the furniture out of my house so I could make all these boxes fit in here . I 'm sitting on a box right now . I can have the lost data professionally recovered , and thus void the warranty , or I can send the device to Maxtor / Seagate ( IF they 'll let me do it with only a receipt , and not the UPC ) and they 'll send me a crappy refurb , no data : " Maxtor has no responsibility whatsoever with regard to any content or data .. " Awesome . I 've got a lose / lose situation here . I will NEVER buy anything branded Maxtor or Seagate again .  
2	  Unless you plan to stop watching television altogether ( and be honest .. you aren't , are you ? ) , then you need Tivo . Why spend an hour watching a program that has upwards of 30 minutes of commercials in it ? Why watch the SAME commercials over and over .. and over ? Why miss your favorite programs or be forced to choose between watching them and going out to eat ? With Tivo , your time becomes your OWN again . Too busy to watch a favorite show ? Just Tivo it and watch it when you want . Hate those annoying commercials ? Tivo the show and you can fast forward right through them .. or just pause the show till the commercial break is over . Need to take a bathroom break at the climax of a movie ? With Tivo , you just pause the show and come back to it after you 've taken your break - and you won't miss a thing . But most importantly , you have much more of your time back again .. not as much as if you stopped watching television completely , but how many of us are that spartan ? And if you are , you don't need Tivo , you need a nomination for sainthood instead .  
1	  I bought this keyboard mainly because I wanted a backlight feature , but it turns out the backlight is very weak and BARELY shines through the keys themselves . So that 's strike # 1 against this product . Strike # 2 came a few months later when I noticed the paint wearing off the most used keys . What kind of POS keyboard is this ? Best Buy told me to email or call Saitek tech support and they will send replacement keys . The BB saleman seemed to be aware of this complaint . So , my advice .. stay away from this keyboard . You might like it the day you buy it , but a few months down the road you will be mad because the paint wears off . UPDATE : After receiveing a second round of keys from Saitek they all wore off AGAIN ! So I have permanently given up on this keyboard . I can't believe how bad this product is . And they are still selling it .  
2	  I now own three sets of these - what more can I say ? One is in the office , one in the bedroom and one in the family room . I have a Zen Sleek that I connect up and they sound great ! Being a casual music listener , I was not looking for high end speakers and these fit the bill for delivering quality sound .  
2	  I 'm a first time GPS user and this item has proved to be a great addition to my life . I have used it locally and in a very large city with no problems . The unit recalculates quickly whenever a wrong turn is made and it will probably save my 34 year marriage .  
1	  My Micromemo showed up today , and on first glance it 's a really sharp , well-designed product . Then I plugged it into my Nano . It 's two hours later , the Nano is locked up , and won't respond to any key commands . iTunes won't recognize it . Apparently the only solution is to let the iPod battery run down and reformat it with iTunes . This means I 've lost the use of the iPod for several days - assuming this works . Thanks , Micromemo . I 'll be mailing it back tomorrow .  
1	  The whole series of Cokin neutral density filters suffers from a major problem .. color cast . When I first started using these , I kept wondering why all of my pictures came out tinged in an ugly magenta-brown shade . One day I broke my Cokin graduated ND filter , so I replaced it with a Singh-Ray - what a world of difference ! See , even though these are called ' neutral ' density , note that they are also called ' grey ' . That should be a clue that they aren't truly neutral after all . The tradeoff is that high quality NDs such as the Singh-Ray will run you about a hundred bucks . If you 're not overly serious about photography , you can get away with the Cokin filters and try and correct for the color in Photoshop . However , for more serious photographers , or amateurs who appreciate higher quality , the more expensive filters are definitely worth the expense . Also , the Cokin filters are made of cheap resin , which tends to scratch and / or break more easily than the expensive glass filters ..  
1	  I recieved one for Christmas in 2009 , and it worked ok in the beginning . I switched to a standard keyboard since it didn't handle my Sidewinder X6 very well ( lots of non-standard macro and multi-media keys ) . Then it began to fail . First sign was that once a day a keyboard key would keep repeeating . Then it had problems switching between computers . It stopped working 5 1/2 months after recieving it . Video was nice while it lasted and flipped between computers quite quickly . Otherwise a poor product .  
2	  Wow , the pictures that this camera takes are fantastic ! I 've had it for 8 months and the pictures that it takes are absolutely incredible . Our old digital 's battery would hardly last two pictures , this battery lasts for days with frequent use . You first look at it and you think it 's small , but it zooms in perfectly . It has tons of settings for taking pictures , my personal favorite is the " Sports " setting so that your pictures with proper focusing will never be blurry . Highly reccomended camera !  
2	  I am very pleased with the camera . It is a nicely designed camera that takes great pictures . The colors , resolution and exposure are all excellent . The controls are easy to use and make the learning process swift for this camera . The only negatives I can think of is : 1 ) the battery life is short and 2 ) while running high resolution you will only get about 12 frames with the included 8mb card . If you purchase this camera I would recommend a higher capacity card and an extra set of rechargable batteries . I have connected this camera to a Windows 98 machine ( a snap ) and to a Windows NT machine ( not recommended because NT doesn't support USB ) and to a Windows 2000 machine . On Windows 98 , the installation was a breeze and I was up and running in no time . On Windows 2000 , I had a bit of trouble getting the camera to work properly . It will not work out of the box but once you install the necessary patch from Kodak it works fine . To Kodak 's credit they don't advertise the camera as 2000 compatible but it would be nice if they would update their software or instructions for folks that need to use the camera with a 2000 machine . I have no problem endorsing this camera for Windows 98 users . It is a great camera .  
1	  I already have a Tamrac bag that holds all my gear , but I bought this case for occasions where I just want to bring my camera with just the one lens attached , and thats it . I have a Pentax K-X , and I bought this specifically to use with the kit lens attached . For what it 's worth , it does protect my camera from minor elements and dings , and it does fit nice and snug around my camera . However , I don't think I 'll be using it much because it is too awkward to put the camera back in the case and close it . Taking it out is easy , but putting it back in and closing it is more of a chore than I want it to be . It 's due to its design . You almost have to turn it inside-out first before you put the camera in , then turn it out again , then grab the camera thru the case with left hand and stretch out the loop ( requires some force ) with right hand in order to loop it around the lens . In my opinion , the best camera cases and bags are designed with ease of use in mind , and should give you the ability to quickly access your camera and quickly put it back without much thought and effort ( like my Tamrac camera bag ) . Plus , the buckle on the strap that you connect to your camera is plastic and very stiff and difficult to use . While the design is novel , and it works in theory , it just doesn't cut it for practical purposes .  
2	  I purchased these headphones a couple days ago , and I feel that they are a fairly decent pair of cans . I happen to be an enjoyer of high quality sound and I am what one might call a " headphone collecter . " I own quite a few pairs of cans ( at least 10 ) including the Sennheiser HD595 audiophile headphones and the rival of the K26s , the Sennheiser PX100 . These headphones will give the listener a sense of privacy by blocking out around 10 decibels of all sound frequencies due to their closed back design ( I feel that they do a very fine job indeed ) . The sound of these cans heavily suits rock , rap , and any other bass heavy music . They produce a nice crisp bass , while the highs and the mid-range are acceptable in that they are slightly recessed . For around 30-50 dollars , these are quite the bargain and I 'd highly suggest them unless you don't care about isolation . If that 's true for you , I 'd suggest the PX100s as they sound better and give a warm / natural sound . These headphones are a bit difficult to mount at first , but you get used to it . They are also tight on your head , but they must be in order to provide adequate isolation . Overall , very nice cans for a good price .  
1	  You can get a near equal quality one for around five bucks ( including shipping ) on sites like meritline .  
1	  These were a present for my son and he used them one day and they stopped working in the middle of listening to a song and we couldn't get them to work again . I was very disappointed . If I knew that they would match the price to the quality then I would have just went to the store and bought a cheap pair that would have lasted longer .  
2	  Works great and haven't had any problems . I did buy a comparable Kingston at the same time and don't notice a difference between the 2 .  
2	  Once again , the superior performance and quality of Taiyo Yuden . If you 're wondering what Taiyo Yuden is , it 's the manufacturer of the FujiFilm CD-R brand . I consider them to be the # 1 manufacturer because of the supremely low C1 error rates , and compatability with all sorts of players . All Memorex discs are made in low quality factories , which 80-85 % of the time produce coasters in half of the spindle . Some low quality factories include : CMC Magnetics , Lead Data , RiTEK , Prodisc , PrincoMost brands such as Memorex , Sony , Imation , Verbatim , they are all made in these factories . Maxell 50 Pack CD-R Audio is Taiyo Yuden , I buy them at Sam 's Club for 12.88 , which is cheap considering the quality of the media . They also like my LITE-ON 52X external , FujiFilm 's are the exact same thing , so I suggest you buy them .  
1	  I bought this for my toddler 's room so I didn't want to pay alot of money for it . I should 've realized that I 'd get what I paid for . Worked fine for about a month or so , then the CD player worked intermittently - sometimes played fine , sometimes wouldn't play at all . A little later the casette player door stopped closing all the way and would cause tapes to sound " warped " and also ate a few tapes . The radio never got good reception despite the antenna . Overall a bad choice .  
2	  The D200 has drawn rave reviews from both users and various photo publications and with good reason . It offers pro-level build quality , handling , metering , flash control and autofocus at a very attractive price . As a bonus , it works perfectly with pretty well any Nikon lens manufactured in the last 30 years . If you have a lot of manual-focus Nikon 35mm gear and are going digital this is the camera to get . One of the unfortunate things about digital photography nowadays is that people like to throw the words " image quality " around , and base it on meaningless things like resolution charts and photos of brick walls and Vermouth bottles they see at popular websites . They lose sight of the things that really matter in photography : the exposure , the focusing , the colours , the contrast , the lighting - all things that the D200 does extremely well . In addition , the D200 is very solidly built and handles very much like a Nikon film camera from the 90 's . About the only negatives I can think of for this camera are the lack of a split-image focusing screen and the fact that only the newest Nikon-compatible flashes will work with TTL metering . Also , the provided software is minimal , and you will definitely need at least a mid-range RAW conversion tool likeNikon CaptureorBibble Pro . Nikon 's philosophy with the D200 is one of " do no harm " , so the images tend to be under-processed straight out of the camera . But you can still get fantastic jpegs if you adjust the saturation , contrast , sharpening and noise reduction to your own tastes . Other cameras in this class include theCanon EOS 30D , Panasonic DMC-L1and theSigma SD14 . Unless you have already bought into one of the other systems , the D200 probably offers the best value for the money . It has no major weaknesses and the build quality , ergonomics , metering and compatibility with existing lenses are all a notch above the others . It is the camera that you are least likely to want to replace in the foreseeable future .  
2	  As a Mac user who favors still photography , I do like to take bits of video here and there , and this fits the bill perfectly . Have only taken video indoors so far and I 've found the video quality to be perfectly adequate ( no faces hidden in the shadows ) . Sound is fine , too . The software included functions fine on my Mac ( although I think you have to have the camera plugged in to see video you 've stored on your computer ) . Have also imported the AVI files into iMovie easily .  
2	  i was a little pissed off cuz it took more than the estimated arrival time for the item to arrive .. but it 's worth the wait . i have a 10 Mp Panny fz28 and this tiny card can store about 1000 pics . i am absolutely love it and i plan to buy another one .  
1	  These headphones are horribily constructed . My first set stop working after 3 or 4 months under very minimal travel and normal use I use it when I 'm on the computer , so not once did it get tugged off my ear . The sound just stop coming . Im on my second pair through vmoda warrianty and the left buds stopped working , in two days time - what the hell . Some says they sound good - but they never say compare to what , iPod headphones . Well sure it sounds good in that case . To me the bass was rich almost overpowering good for some not for all . I bought the shure se210 on amazon for 110 plus shipping . These feel so much more durable and sounds much more balanced . If your a bass person and you have an iPod use the equilzers . They work fine . These vmoda feels like an expensive overpriced toy-wait it is .  
2	  You may wan't to know this : Card is fine , but many laptop readers don't support > 2GB , so you have to use camera and USB-cable to get 8GB .  
1	  if you 're looking for an inexpensive solution to get 200mm , then i guess this is a winner . if you expect to have a reasonably sharp photo at 200mm then you will be disappointed . it 's a fine lens until you rack it out . then the photo just falls apart .  
1	  I trust Linksys for all their products except this . I run Windows XP and was getting a Low signal less than 10 feet away . I got this so I can work upstairs but I would get intermittent signals and speeds less than 45kbps ( if I was lucky ) . I returned it and got an Orinoco Gold instead , and it 's GREAT , 1.5Mbps anywhere in the house .  
2	  It is an excellent mouse . And I like the PS2 adapter , which allows us to use either PS2 or USB port .  
1	  I bought this camera because at the time , I liked the specs on it & it was a reasonable price . But I guess this camera goes to show you that you get what you pay for ! This camera is a notch below okay . It isn't something I 'd recommend to anyone , not even my worst enemy . You can put brand new batteries in it & you have about 5 , 10 minutes before they 're dead & you have to replace them . It doesn't even go easy on rechargeable batteries , no matter what brand . This camera is also not good for events like concerts or anywhere you think you 'll be taking a lot of pictures ( believe me , I 've learned from personal experience ) . It was annoying taking a couple of pictures , then immediately turning it off to save battery life so I could take a couple more pictures , only to turn it back off to continue saving battery life so I can have enough to take pictures of the other bands that were playing . If you 're trying to record a video , forget it , brand new batteries or not . If you have a 15 minute video you 're wanting to record , you better cut that sucker down to 5 minutes because that 's about how long it will take before your batteries are dead . My advice is - don't waste your money on this camera ! Spare an extra few dollars for a better one that comes with its own battery that you can charge & will last you a good 13 - 15 hrs ! The battery life was my main peeve about this camera .  
1	  I specifically ordered the " Lenmar " made by Sharp brand which as you can see , it 's of yellow color and advertised for 1 cent plust $ 4.99 for a total of $ 5.00 dollars . Lenmar CBC446 3.6V 850mAh NI-MH Replacement Battery for UNIDEN CORDLESS PHONESI got the package in the mail but when I opened it , I got a " White " battery instead and a different brand ( not made by Sharp ) . Even though the battery is the same shape and it fits my phone , it is not what Amazon or emtcom merchant advertised as the " Lenmar " yellow colored battery which is better quality . I am dissapointed and I feel like i was cheated by Amazon or the merchant showing customers a different picture and item description to get you to order and then they ship you a different , ( cheaper brand ) that they original show on the website . Just be aware and double check before you order . I guess the sky is not always blue as we see it . I hate deceiving advertising . I hope this is just a mistake by Amazon and not deliberately misleading .  
2	  It 's great product and quietest power supply you can have . Thermaltake ToughPower offer fair price , given the stability and features .  
1	  I faithfully used my prior Logitech Harmony 880 , and when it finally broke , I decided to upgrade to Logitechs 's flagship 1000 model ( which I have been using for several months ) . However , the new Harmony 1000 is so painful to use that I am seriously considering swallowing the $ 500 and buying another 880 ! I have had to dig out my original device remote controls , and once again have 3 different remotes littering the coffee table . My wife has given up , and completely refuse to use this thing anymore . Problems specific to the 1000 model : 1 . It uses ' beta ' software and crashes regularly . Adding salt to the wound , there is no reset switch , and you have to pry open a stubborn battery latch , remove and replace the battery , and then wait several minutes to reboot . 2 . The touch screen is cumbersome , it is not very customizable , and it is poorly laid out . The unintended result of streamlining this remote and removing the hard buttons is that it forces the user to navigate multiple menus just to get to the desired buttons . However , you cannot rearrange the screen to simply include you most frequently used commands , nor can you choose which set of buttons first pops up when you choose an activity . 3 . The touch screen forces you to actually look at the remote to find the buttons you want , like the guide or menu button . Also , the screen saver kicks in after a few minutes , and then forces you to first joggle the device to ' wake up ' so you can see the screen . 4 . The shape makes it very difficult to use with one hand ( and I have large but agile monkey hands ) . Those are my top complaints for the Harmony 1000 . I do still enjoy a good universal remote , but this is not the model to buy . Please note that it you happen do get a Logitech universal remote ( the 880 was fine ) , be prepared for a Lengthy set up process to get it correctly tweaked . It takes a long time for Logitech 's remotes to change settings , and tweaking your first remote for optimal efficiency can take an hour + .  
2	  This was one of the best purchases I could have made along with my new LED monitor . Not having the easy option for two monitors , I knew that I wanted to continue to use my Macbook 13 " as a secondary monitor , mostly for stickies and mail , leaving my main monitor open for Photoshop ( which is what I spend most of my day on ) . I picked this stand mainly due to the aesthetics , but there are numerous other merits to it : - Strong , wobble-less design ( unlike others I have tried ) - Promotes better air flow ( small reduction in temps noticed ) - Elevates Macbook Aluminum 13 " to an excellent height for dual monitor usage - Easy cable management with the hole on the back - Even when not using secondary monitor , this has helped my posture by elevating the laptop screen - Finish is VERY close to the Apple aluminum - Cutout for easy lid openingOverall there is just no comparison ! This is absolutely the best stand for Apple ( and other ) laptops on the market . Due to its stationary nature and lack of moving parts , you can fully expect this product to last you for YEARS . The metal used seems mostly scratch-proof , indeed I have seen little o no wear in the year I have owned it ! I would highly recommend this to both people with an external monitor , and those using the laptop by itself - it will improve your posture and reduce strain on your neck and back ! Highly recommended !  
2	  This is my everyday ' backpack ' camera , when I 'm not carrying my slightly larger Fuji S700 or much larger S9000 . It replaces my excellent A400 because of it 's added features , such as the 4X zoom instead of 3X ( not a big difference , but enough ) , as well as all the added scene position choices . I 've done close-ups , portraits , night shots , landscapes and indoor scenes with and without flash , and I 'm impressed . Enlargements are no problem for this camera , either . It 's easy to carry just about anywhere . Learn to use the ISO settings and scene positions and even get a tiny tripod-the camera will amaze you . Fujifilm Finepix A820 8MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom  
1	  I never ordered this product , did not want the product , did not need the product , cost was only 4-5 bucks so not worth fooling with trying to get my money back .  
1	  First the key broke . So I desperate tried to break the lock to get rid of it , and it broke too ! What kind of security would it provide my laptop if I can break the lock with a jerk ? Well I paid only $ 3 for it and got this piece of junk .  
2	  If you hate tangles of cords this is for you . The product is kinda flat and not round as I thought so takes a few more wraps to get the cord around . Overall would buy again .  
1	  First the good : the remote works well , and is fairly versatile . It can learn any IR device you have , and the online database of ready to go remotes is huge , so if you have lost your old remote , it is probably in the database for you . The form factor is easy to hold and press the buttons with one hand . The keys are back lit , and the full color screen is easy to read . It 's rechargeable , and the remote cradle helps you keep track of where you left the remote ! Now the less than good : A ) The remote does not sit solidly in its cradle - you have to wiggle it to make sure it charges . Even the updated cradle after the recall is problematic . B ) The setup software leaves MUCH to be desired : UPDATE : Software still is very poor . below is my recent analysis of the poor software : 1 ) You cannot reorder the devices list - it is created in the order you create devices , and that is the order they appear on the remote . If you have more than 8 devices , then some will be on a second page on the remote screen - while it would be preferable to have certain " hot " devices on that main screen . 2 ) The database if full of commands that don't exist , and that end up on your list of commands for you to delete - and deleting commands , and moving commands around is tedious - in some cases there are 10 pages of " additional commands " on the remote to page through - and to delete them and reorder these commands is simply annoying . 2b ) Database commands frequently don't work , and commands that should stream , don't stream . ( I. e . continuous actuation ) . 3 ) When you try to create your own device , the software will push a device template on you that may or may not work well . 4 ) You cannot set " evergreen " commands . For instance , the volume + - should be work the receiver volume REGARDLESS what device is active . You can only make this happen as an " activity " , and have to individually program it for each activity . 5 ) In general , the software is a bit clumsy to use - it 's a Java based app , and therefore does not use the drag and drop functionality of the operating system ( Windoze or Mac ) - and leaves much to be desired . 6 ) You cannot assign commands to " stream " such that when you hold down a button , the command is continuously sent - this is allowed for volume , but for any other command , you have to pay Logitech $ 29.00 to set a command to stream . A well designed application would allow for drag and drop command arrangement , setting evergreen keys ( such as making volume and mute affect the receiver at all times ) , Assigning the order of devices both on the main device menu , and while a specific activity was active . 7 ) HORRIBLE SUPPORT . Absolutely useless . And if you ask questions on their user forum with even a hint that you may not like a feature , they will delete your account . At vers 7.7 I 'd think it would be a bit more customizable , but they are a long way from an easy to use and highly configurable product . Here are the principal issues : 1 ) General cludgyness : the setup is so terribly long , involved and " Fisher-Price " simplified . It is annoying , cumbersome , slow , tedious , and limiting . Specifically , adding and moving custom buttons , navigating through the " wizards " and trying to find where you have hidden some particular " option " is utterly aggravating . Seriously , you expect us to guess the difference from " Settings " or " Options " ? ! ? ! - how unclear can you get ? " Customize buttons " is on the main activities page for activities , but buried in the " options " or " settings " page for devices . The inconsistency throughout the application is aggravating . 2 ) LACK OF CONTROL : you have designed the remote to function around " activities " , yet they do not provide full control of activities . WHY ? In order to have functions of a certain device available in an activity , then you have to add that device TO the activity . 3 ) CAN'T REORDER DEVICES ( in or not in an activity ) . Okay , so you want us to program the device around activities - but as noted above , even then you do not have accurate control of devices added to an activity . We need the ability to reorder devices when not in an activity , and reorder them separately if desired for each activity . they way you have it now , the devices move all over the place in seemingly random ways , and when you have more than 8 devices it is INCREDIBLY annoying to hunt and find them in some new location each time . Random device positions ? Yea , great idea . NOT . This is a horrid " feature " ! 4 ) BAD IR COMMAND DATABASE . Okay , here 's a case of quantity does not equal quality . It seems like every user 's custom programmed commands get stuck into this database . While this might be an easy way for you to " grow " your database , using the database becomes cumbersome at best . Moreover , many commands are mislabeled , or do not function as expected . It seems that mis-named commands get into the database and never get out . Worse , for use users , there is no way to permanently edit the database to suit our particular device . In other words , we 'd like to be able to make our own localized version of a particular device and customize the entire command list - this would not affect your main database , just our remote . This way , everytime we went to adjust the programming of our remote , we wouldn't have to scroll through the hundreds of useless commands that do not apply to our device . 5 ) IR COMMAND LEARNING LIMITATIONS . Yes , you can learn new commands . But you have little control over those commands . For instance , on original remotes , some commands will " stream " a commands when you hold a button down . With harmony , you seem to be able to do that only with volume . A serious deficiency . The only way to get the remote to stream commands is to PAY customer service ( $ 29.00 as of this writing ) to set a command to stream - after spending hundreds on a remote , this is ludicrous . There should be an option to stream any command , but again , tis is left out of the software . 6 ) CAN'T SAVE SETUPS . Right , so we make a mistake , but after we re-configure , there is no way to " get back " to a previous programmed state . 7 ) MUST BE ONLINE . If order to program your remote , you must be online , and you cannot work offline to program or configure the remote . Why ? why should I have to be online for a learning remote ? You should allow for offline configuration , learning , saving , etc . SUMMARY OF FEATURES THAT ARE NEEDED : For the config software : Put all settings for a device in ONE place , under ONE menu . Stop spreading config pages all over the place . Consistency : Chose one term , " settings " OR " options " and stick with it . Put related settings in the same relative place throughout the application . Allow for direct settings controls instead of cumbersome wizards . Allow devices in activities to NO CHANGE STATE when entering that activity . Allow device reordering , both outside of activities , and in each activity . Allow deleting IR commands for a device . Allow " stream " commands ( like volume ) but for any command ( selection choice ) . Be able to " save as " setups , to store previous configurations . Be able to work offline . Final comment : Seriously , it 's 2010 - these things should be self evident . It seems instead that Logitech hired programmers that got fired from Microsoft . Poor implementation , and other much more feature rich remotes out there - I am sorry i made this purchase , and I refuse to ever buy another Logitech product . My encounters with the utterly abysmal tech support have left me less than satisfied .  
1	  Honggang Ma is exactly right . I saw this product in a store . Loved it 's simplicity , 3.1 Mpixels for an incredible price . I thought : " What 's the catch ? " Then I asked about the type of memory . The store clerk had no idea . He climbed a ladder to find the box , and still we couldn't make heads or tails of the info . I used the web to find all sorts of reviews . Nothing specifically mentioned the memory . Then I found the previous review here at Amazon ( GREAT reviews ) . This settles the issue for me . What do you do when on vacation and you simply MUST buy another mem card ? With this camera , NOTHING ! If you are not concerned about this issue , then definitely buy this camera . You will not find a higher resolution for the price . Be aware though , this is a " point & click " snapshot camera only .  
1	  First off , this product is incredibly easy to setup . Everything just worked right off the bat . About the only hitch was I had my transmitter placed to close to my lap top which caused interference , but Creative did a great job of communicating this limitation . Sound is crystal clear and the device is attractive and compact . I plan on buying additional receivers for the bedroom , the kitchen and den . BTW I plan on using 2.1 computer speakers since they give great sound and are very affordable . I strongly recommend Logitech speakers since they always have great sound and build quality . I 've owned these for a year and a half now and it 's not transmitting anymore . Creative has no tech support on this product at all and have been totally unresponsive to my inquiries . It was very disappointing to find this out .  
1	  This monitor has alot of static and you pick - up other monitors in the neighborhood ! It has only 2 channels ( not much privacy ! ) i wish i had bought one of the 900 mgh monitors instead ! In fact i am looking for new monitors now to replace these ones ! Please , don't waste your money here !  
1	  Am a loyal fan of Sony products but this one has me puzzled . The analog tuner constantly drifts . Battery life is fantastic but with the constant readjustment of the dial I keep losing the signal . Yes , we are in a rural area but my old Walkman with cassette from 11 years ago still had a much better overall quality . Sony needs to rethink this one if it 's to be usable while I 'm walking or working . Will soon try a digital tuning Sony Walkman w / o casette player and see if the quality is any better .  
2	  I 've been on " the hunt " for some time to find a relatively simple way to transfer some of my old LP 's to CD 's , but everything I came across seemed to require hook-ups from the computer directly to your stero system . So I was pleasantly surprised to come across a description of the ION iTTUSB05 USB Turntable in of all places , AARP magazine . At $ 99.0 and a simple USB hook-up from the turntable to your computer , it seemed too good to be true . But just having received it , and tried out some transfers of some of my favorite old Van Morrison LP 's , I can say that it performs as advertised . The included CD has both software for a simple transfer directly to I-tunes as well as a more advanced software to play around with cleaning up some of the pops and clicks that are on the LP 's . I used both types of software and found that even tne advanced software was fairly easy to use . The transfer sound was much better than I anticipated . Even exporting to Wave files and MP3 's using the more advanced is quite easy using the addtional LAME software that can be downloaded . What can I say .. so far , I 'm a believer .  
2	  I bought this remote to use for long exposures with my D60 . It has one button which does exactly what you 'd expect - opens and / or closes the shutter . Two minutes after I opened the package I was taking my first test shots , and that was only because I had to find the right settings on my camera . As some other reviews have pointed out , the remote has to be in line of sight with your camera 's sensor in order to work , but that is no great inconvenience for my needs .  
1	  Sluggish performance after 9 months use so if you are buying this camera for a limited time use then its a good buy but its not worth the price if you intend to use it for a long time . Warranty included is 90 days which means you dont have anywhere to go after 4-5 months of use . Simply the pic quality starts to degrade after some time . I bought it in April 2003 from Amazon for $ 228 and it started annoying me by July / August 2003 . The video mode is the worst ever , in the beginning it used to give much better results but I am not fond of this now anymore . Better use a camcord to capture video images . The image quality at night is rated " 0 " by me , but again it all started after a few months had passed , I had no problems with this little thing in the begining . 95 % of the pics that I take now come out to be blurry and gloomy . Overall I dont recommend this camera cause it wont last long .  
1	  I am not the kind of guy that frequently posts reviews of products on Amazon or elsewhere . In fact , I think this is the first ( or maybe second to give myself the benefit of a doubt ) review I have ever posts . I do , however , rely on other people 's reviews when making a product selection . Hence , I really must caution anyone from purchasing any Maxtor or Seagate external hard drive . I have purchased three hard drives from them and have had the same experience with all three . After about a year give or take a couple of months , ALL of drives have simply failed with an internal electrical fault . The most recent one was today . This wouldn't have been such a big problem if I had discovered the failure of my hard drive backup BEFORE my iMac decided to throw a fit and require a reload of OS X. I have to tell you that , while the drives ( all different models ) seemed like a good deal at the time I was shopping through CostCo , whatever money I saved is not worth the incredible frustration I feel right now . All I can do is close the doors and windows and vent how well pissed off I am with a very loud Sh # $ ! Lesson learned . Sometimes is little extra money is well spent .. especially on data backup !  
1	  There was a picture of one a little further down the page and a special price if the second one was bought . I was not happy with the second one that I got . The picture of the first one was showed as the same for the second but in fact was not . I bought on the idea that the second one would be the same as the first but it was not and I did not like the second one and probably will not use it or order anything again from Amazon because of this fact . The picture shown here is the one I liked but not like the second one .  
1	  Pros : 1 ) Small2 ) ShinyCons : 1 ) Cables hang out sides , very awkward . Makes putting on a stereo shelf look just plain ugly . 2 ) The IR on this unit is a disaster ! My Pioneer remotes make this unit switch DVI inputs . Then you have to flip these dip switches on your Gefen remote , then dips on the switcher .. then try again ! Arrgghh . Stinks . I will try another brand .  
1	  I bought this product from Wal-Mart and I loved how it looked but once I used it for maybe 3 days I hated it . The little sleeves keep falling out and it is just a big mess . I don't reccommend it .  
1	  Of the two packages I ordered ( four sticks , total ) , there was a bad stick in each that did not pass Memtest even through Test 4 . The ones that did work were only stable at CL5 timings . I 'm currently going through the Amazon return policy to get them replaced . System configuration was an Asus P5K-C , timings were 800MHz DDR2 , CL5-5-5 .  
2	  I almost want to give these 4 stars because they don't have the range of full sized floor standing speakers . The reason they get a five is bang for the buck . And I hate saying that because it sounds like I 'm saying a crappy product that 's cheap . Really , these speakers are just amazing . I have them paired up with the HK AVR 254 . The highs are crisp and sharp while the sub , albeit only 100 watts , is the best 100 watt sub I 've ever heard . Loud , full , deep just like a much higher wattage sub . This speaker set really is just outstanding not just in performance though . They have a reflective black casing and hard grill making them nearly invisible when watching a movie in the dark , but when the lights are on or the sun is out , the speakers are just really slick looking . HK didn't even spare on packaging supplies . Each speaker was wrapped in a material that felt like silk . Just amazing quality everywhere from performance -> look -> packaging . You just can't go wrong .  
2	  This is a nifty little unit that functions exactly as billed . It might be considered a " fast food " version of a camcorder . The video quality is acceptable - MPEG4 resolution which is roughly equivalent to VHS . But where it shines is the simple user interface . If you want to capture a moment quickly , you can be shooting within 20 seconds . And you can email a brief 20 second clip in 90 seconds after shooting it ( assuming your computer is in the same room ! ) . The controls are simple , with nothing to set , and it 's much simpler than trying to shoot video with your digital still camera . You can use Nero 6.6 or 7 to burn your videos to a DVD or a VCD . The zoom lens is digital , not optical , so there is a noticeable decrease in quality when you use it . And the little built in microphone doesn't have much range . But given the price , this gizmo can't be beat . I loved mine so much , I bought 2 more as birthday gifts for friends .  
1	  You have to jiggle the cable to get it to work sometimes . You get what you pay for , I guess . Spend the extra few dollars and get a good one .  
1	  I own 50mm f1.8 and this 50mm f1.4 . The f1.4 is not worth in price if f1.8 is existing . Many test were performed personally . The f1.4 time to focus is not better than f1.8 ( almost same time ) ; the IQs are almost the same ; f1.4 is much heavier ; f1.4 has slightly better in color , higher built quality and silent focus . For those pros in f1.4 are not my favorite to count on lense . Many reviews mention this lense is not advanced than f1.8 ( I hope read them early ) . I recommended to buy f1.8 and save the extra . Good luck .  
1	  I purchased this battery for my Sony camcorder . I tried to charge it but was not able to . Therefore , I returned it and purchased a battery directly from Sony . I do not recommend this battery to anyone who has a Sony camcorder .  
2	  1 . open the disc holder2 . press 1,3,7,9 and 03 . player is now region free ! enjoy  
2	  I 've had my Bose 3s for 6-8 months , and absolutely love them . The sound , especially when playing games , is clear , dynamic and spacey . I have the two little speakers sitting either side of my work desk , on separate cabinets , sitting about shoulder height - facing straight ahead , not directed towards me . The subby is positioned under the desk and back towards the wall . The * puck * volume adjustor cum line in / line out unit shipped originally with a sticky base , which helped keep it in place on the desk surface . It lost its stickiness after about 2 weeks , but nevertheless still works fine . I like this system so much I thought about replacing my TV room stereo with one , but unfortunately it doesn't come with a wireless remote , and therefore I couldn't use it with the universal . I have to admit the Companion does lack a little when playing music , but not enough to turn me off using it constantly . When I sit friends down in front of my computer and play something through the Bose , they 're immediately impressed - especially when I show them the size of the unit the sound is coming from . I didn't really listen to that many other similar systems because I realised , once I had heard the Bose , it was the one for me . I highly recommend the Bose Companion 3 unit .  
1	  It can fit the laptop and a few flat sheets of paper only ; not even room enough for the power cable or a mouse . Who needs that ?  
1	  I agree with another comment that the button on the side of the handle is to easy to accidentally press and change the mode unknowingly . When using with the Canon PowerShot S3 IS , I found it doesn't work with the manual settings I prefer . You have to still use the pop-up flash to trigger the slave . Maybe a diffuser to eliminate the effects of the pop-up will impove the results . While it does what it said it would do , in order to do what I want to do , I need to upgrade my whole system . If I want to be professional , I need a professional system . This is okay for now while I 'm getting my studio business back up and running .  
1	  I had the MPD820 for almost a year when it quit working . I was living in Baton Rouge and my family was in Shreveport . I had recently had a baby and was making the 10 hour round trip more than once a month . So to be honest , I wasn't much surprised when the screen of my unit developed a short in it from all of the bumps in the road ( the screen shifts in the sling as you drive ) . At first , I just had to readjust the screen so that it would come on . Eventually the entire screen went out . I say that I wasn't surprised by the fact that it went out - mainly b / c I have little faith in anyone 's quality of work anymore . So few people take pride in what they build . It is actually cheaper for Magnavox to replace those units which turn up defective within the first 90 days than it is to ( a ) build the unit correctly or ( b ) hire someone to fix those that have problems . I will definatly think twice before buying another Magnavox . I 'm now in the market for a new DVD player . I 'm taking suggestions as I obviously am not good at picking one out myself . ;) [ .. ]  
2	  The E5C 's were well made - very good sound but uncomfortable . The sound quality is noticeable better - cleaner lows and highs . I liked the build quality of the e5c 's better . These are so more comfortable . The rounded and lighter build contributes to the comfort . I really like the PTH - people come up to me when I am listening - one has to remove the earphone before the PTH . Many others don't think much of the PTH . Few other like the PTH but it is one of the best aspects of this model for me .  
1	  this product does normalize the audio as advertise but it also introduces some significant artifacts . i can heard severe popping noises when i watch movies with high dynamic range audio . it 's very annoying . i ended up not using this product . i know everyone is extremely irritated from uneven audio butt he only sound solution is buy an audio receiver with some audio normalization feature . it 's expensive but there 's no other option . good luck everyone .  
2	  The Antec Sonata Mid Tower Case is solid , quiet , and heavy like a block of Black Ice ! The first one was so good , I bought a second for another PC rebuild . The large 120mm case and very quite PS fan finally brought peace and quiet to the room . Easy removal of front bay drives with screw on rails with clips - same for the large number of side facing internal drive bays . ATX boards fix perfectly . Solid construction . Amazon 's free super savings makes this a great deal .  
2	  There are already a ton of reviews on this item , just wanted to add another 5 stars as a satisfied costumer . I have only seen the pros listed here and none of the negatives . The logitech software works well on windows and mac machines . Got it as a gift for my parents and now getting a Harmony 1 for my own place .  
2	  This router is Excellent for Mac users . Works like a dream .. easy set up and installation .  
1	  I had no trouble setting it up at all , although it worked less well than I had expected . However , after less than a year of use , it 's dead . Completely . A minor matter - some of the mounting hardware was missing from the box . Fortunately , I didn't really need it , but it was a bit annoying .

2	  the item worked exactly as i hoped . i needed this product to fix a new computer . this helpedthe wires were well made . i did nothave any difficulties getting it to work  
1	  This product was great at first , the sound was perfect . A few months later I noticed the quality was slowly getting worse . A year later and I 'm on amazon searching for a new one . The sound is so muffled that I can't hear the lyrics from many songs , esp . songs with any synthesizers . I would not recommend this particular adapter to anyone who wants to use it for more than a few months .  
2	  YOU WILL NEED THIS CABLE TO GET THE BEST VIEW FOR YOUR TV WORTH THE PRICE YOU WON'T BE DISSPOINTED  
1	  One star because there is no Black Hole rating . This keyboard KILLED my PC . After installing the supplied driver I got a BSOD that told me my PC could not be booted . I did not notice until afterwards that the driver CD said WINDOWS 98 - after all this keyboard is for people with poor eyesight ! The BSOD kindly informed me that if I had installed any new hardware and drivers to please uninstall them which I couldn't , natch , because I could not get past the Blue Screen of Death . I hate sarcastic error messages . Tried Last Good Config , Safe Mode , everything I could think of . Could not boot , period . I hadn't backed up my data for a week and lost a lot of time consuming Photoshop work . Thank goodness for external hard drives as at least I had most of my work saved . Still , it took me nearly 36 hours straight to get my spare PC configured and set up . Now I have to buy a new Spare PC . What a nightmare .  
2	  Before using this card , I bought a Network Everywhere NC100 card ( by Linksys , but it 's part of their " cheaper model " line ) and used it for a week and took it back . So , I got this one and installed it after about an hour , but it was not at all because of Linksys , but because I had forgot to " remove " the card 's drivers before taking it out , and when I installed the new card 's drivers over the last I had many problems . I fresh install of Windows 98 did it . Overall , this card is very exceptional , and improved my connection from a 1.3 Mbps connection through a USB connection with my cable modem to a 1.6 Mbps connection through ethernet . I am happy I paid the extra money for this , because it works great . I also bought a Linksys router which should arrive soon . LInksys is very reliable and I will never buy anything else . PLus , they have extensive support for new drivers so you never need to worry about the card not working properly . It is super fast , and it has some Wake-on-Lan option that lets you turn your computer on from anywhere on the network . I never use it , but this thing rocks . Version Reviewed : 5.1  
1	  I intend to replace them with some speakers that shound good quite soon .  
1	  I regret buying this product since day1 u have to reboot it again and again and now atlast after 6 months only it died on me .  
1	  I have this mouse for over an year and it always had issues with disconnection problems . I talked to logitech and they said that they will send me a replacement and I have chosen Performance MX . This mouse was taken out from logitech and brought back after couple of months . The issue I have is also the top one is their forums . The customer care does not know if the problem has been rectified after a couple of versions of this mouse . its a good mouse with swappable batteries which i like a lot . Batteries do no last more than a week . Buy it and see if this works for you . you can always get a replacement with a warranty of 3 years .  
2	  This is a top quality printer that makes excellent prints that have an expected life of 100 years using separate ink cartiridges so that only individual inks need to be replaced instead of all the inks when one runs out as found in some of the cheaper printers . The cheaper printers such as the Epson 820 will give similar lookingprints that will not last as long . I like the printer better than some of the other more expensive printers like the Hewlett-Packard 7960 ( which I also own ) . This printer only makes prints that are 8.5 inches wide although it can make panoramic prints that are 8.5 by 23.3 inches in the standard size included with the printer . If you want wider prints , Epson has now introduced the R1800 printer using the same cartridges as the R800 printer ( a minor miracle ) .  
1	  The headband looks like it should sit flat on your head , but it doesn't . You have to move the headphones around a little to get the noise cancelling to kick in , and the sharp plastic edge of the band digs into your scalp like a slow medieval torture ( yes , I have hair , it doesn't help ) . I have been seen sitting on planes with part of an airplane pillow on my head , just trying to make these livable for an hour . The low price and somewhat-functional noise cancelling are useless if you can't wear them . Order something else , I am .  
2	  I bought this for our whole house stereo speakers ( 7 different rooms plus our back patio ) . It works really well and creates less heat in the cabinet then our older version of this amp .  
2	  When I first bought my Rebel XT , I never thought this could happen to me but it DID ! Somehow I got something on my sensor and it smeared . I wanted the dust spots gone . I was terrified . I just knew that my sensor was history and that my camera had just become a very expensive paper weight . I went ahead and bought this kit and used it . WOW ! The first pass with the wand and cleaner and the smear was almost undetectable . I used several pec pads to make sure that all of WHATEVER that was , was gone for good . I went outside and took a few photos of the sky at f22 and loaded them on my computer and it was clean . The smear and dust spots were gone . My heart finally started beating again . I wish I had bought this kit sooner becasue my camera was out of commission too long . I was starting to have withdrawls . I would set it on my desk and stare at it longingly .. Buy this kit and keep it handy . But as you have read , DO NOT clean your sensor unless ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY . There are better uses for your camera other than a paper weight . Use the rocket blower , it works great and puts out a powerful stream of air . I thank Curt at Micro-Tools for a great product and fast service . Oh , and thanks for the candy , it is a nice touch .

2	  I ordered this router and it was defective on arrival . I sent it to D-link and they sent me another unit and it was also defective . I finally found a helpful tech guy at D-Link who offered to test the third replacement with a Mac ( the previous units were unable to configure the wireless part of the router ) and when it arrived it worked ( with some minor setup problems ) and still works great . In spite of the claims on the manufacturers website the tech support for Mac users is non existent . They are polite , but noone there has a clue about using their hardware with Macs . I have had the router for 2 years now and it has worked flawlessly .  
2	  I 've always been a fan of Koss headphones , although their cheaper headphones ( the 20 $ ones ) don't last that long , they always have had great sound quality . Well , with the PortaPros , they give excellent sound quality , and seem to be very durable ( I 've only had them for a couple of weeks , but they get daily use and I 've dropped them a few times but they don't seem damaged in the slightest ) . Overall , if you 're going to buy a pair of 50 $ headphones , it should come down between these at the Sennheiser PX100s , and having listened to both the sound quality is not much different-mainly only the structural design ( The Sennheisers are slick no joke ) ; however , the Koss Lifetime NO QUESTIONS ASKED Warranty beats all the competition . BUY THESE HEADPHONES , NOW .  
1	  The item came with missing parts . The company then tried to make me go thru hoops to discourage me from getting the missing parts . They finally told me the part was back ordered and told me they would send it . Four weeks later and I have nothing and by the way Amazon said it was not their problem . I will never purchase on Amazon again .  
1	  I thought I was going crazy .. but now I know . I had one for about a year and a half when it went dead with similar power problems . I went and bought another thinking it was an issue with the power in our guest room . The second ( later model ) lasted just a few months ! What a waste . Toshiba will be loosing a lot of loayal cutomers .  
1	  I tried the iTrip with different frequencies the result was consistant - Low quality sound and too much noise disturbance . I am returning the product .  
1	  I recently bought this camera through this website . After extensive research , I was won over by the other review here that tells of the ease of use with Macs iMovies because we were planning to purchase a new iMac . Well , the new computer is here and after several days of frustration I have learned that this camera will only import video to macs with OS X 10.1-10.3 . Lo and Behold all new iMacs are loaded with OS X 10.4 and this Camera is totally unable to communicate . The folks at panasonic are alternatingly clueless and unhelpful after waiting on the phone around 20 min . and they don't plan on releasing and drivers to make this brand new model of camera compatible with the brand new model of operating system ! I am at my wits end and out 800 bucks !  
2	  This is a great player for the price . The only reason I didn't rate it a 5 was because of the earphones that come with it . They are adequate but much better could be purchased to replace them . Great sound from the player .  
2	  I just ordered this last week and I love it , very snappy , plays DVD 's burns CD 's , you can boot an ISO from it in the BIOS no problem . Powered by the USB which is more awesome ! This drive saved me a request for servicing my Aspire One , I just plugged it in , inserted the disk , booted my copy of Windows XP , fixed the Master Boot Record and I was back to normal . Great product , great seller . Make sure you DON'T PAY $ 79.99 for this . The other sellers have it for just $ 29.99 and it 's worth every penny , these sellers are just as good as buying from Amazon directly , shipping wasn't bad either .  
2	  Works great . I use it to connect from my netbook to my usb port on my sound system . I have all my music on my netbook and I love being able to sit in my recliner and punch up tunes .  
2	  I bought this item to carry my 8 GB Zune while I 'm at the gym , and does its job very well . It 's very comfortable against my skin ( I think the material is neoprene ) , and it 's easy to access my Zune to increase the volume or change the music . The band that wraps around your arm isn't very long , though , so I wouldn't use this product if you had big upper arms , saymore than 4 inches in diameter or 16 inches in circumference ) .  
2	  This is EXCELLENT data destroyer product . It is relatively very small product when compare to many other data destroyer products such as shredders . When it is in use , the noise level is reasonable . Other review had commented that it is too noisy but I disagree-the noise level is at normal level expected out of machines which have moving parts . Since the size of this product is so small , it is very convenient and easy to move around and easy to place it to other location .  
1	  I recently bought a tower fan from Bionaire . It looked pretty good in the store and was supposed to be quiet . It worked well for about a day and then got out of balance . I didn't even move the fan so I have no idea how it got out of balance . It is now two weeks old and it sounds like it is about to die . If I was selling a product that was this pathetic , I wouldn't put my company name on it .  
2	  This DVD player is very easy to use and the up converting to 1080p on our new 61 " Samsung LED HDTV is awesome . Played my old " Independence Day " DVD with the new equipment for the first time and it is really like stepping into the scenes .  
1	  I won this in a drawing so for something free , I can't complain too much . However after maybe 2-3 uses , it no longer plays even after charging . The play button seems to have been pushed in and no longer clicks . This may be a reason why I can't get it playing . I won't get a replacement .  
2	  This bag is sexy , feminine , and chic . The only problem I have is that I think it should have the carrying handles on the outside which makes it more functionable to carry and made from the faux-croc . The handles that stores inside makes this laptop bag look cheap .  
1	  i saw it , read about it , thought it was everything i needed . Boy , was I wrong ! This thing is .. crap ! When a song is playing , sometimes I want to switch to a new one . It 's frozen up on me 3 times ! Then , I have to wait for the battery to run out , and then recharge . It takes forever ! And every single time i recharge it , it runs out of power even faster than before . The settings are so messed up ! For some reason , all the songs kept switching around . I am the only one who messes with it . Turns out for some reason , it was put on shuffle mode ! And the radio is so hard to figure out , you have to use the manual to get it ! And the radio quality is horrible . The sound quality overall is bad too . I bought this as a congratulations for finishing middle school with money my parents gave me . Now I am paying the consequences . I am earning to buy a new iPod nano . DO NOT BUY THIS . I AM WARNING YOU ! DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER , IF YOU EVEN CALL IT THAT ! I call it .. a waste of my good money and crap .

Muy recomendable alternativa para celular , cuando uno se mueve cerca de la casa y tiene chicos .  
2	  I have used the mailbug for the past 11 months , have bought 9 for family members and find the mailbug an unbeliveable tool for me at home . It sits in my kitchen and my wife and daughter use it daily . My father is literally on the mailbug 5 times a day sending email , checking his stock and being a news buff , checking on the latest political happenings . I strongly recommend this product for ANYONE that wants easy access to email and news , stocks , entertainment and weather . GREAT product !  
1	  The camera itself looks nice though is a little bigger than you would expect . The problem is that the image is simply - as noted many times below - too dark to be usable . Now apparently this is a known logitech problem , but also apparently , logitech does not care enough to fix this problem on their flagship webcam . I purchased this camera because my wife is far far away for a few months , and I would really have liked to be able to see her once in a while . She 's somewhere where there are no webcams to purchase . It 's such a crappy picture , that we are not even bothering to webcam anymore . So I 'm giving logitech two-three weeks , and if it 's not fixed I will ( a ) file a Better Business Bureau complaint ;( b ) never buy anything from Logitech again ; and ( c ) post this review everywhere possible on the internet . Go elsewhere .  
2	  I like the C340 . I am amazed at how well if performs . My only problem is that I can not figure out how to enter an intersectioin in the go to option . Sam Strong for Helga  
1	  If you have a XP machine with SP2 do not buy this adapter . It 's such a pain in the next to install , and whats even worse is that belkin doesn't provide support . I had to download RAlink drivers , install it , uninstall it , copy the files to another directory , modify the . inf file for the card , and reinstall it .. If you have no idea what i 'm talking about .. stay away from it .. i just threw my out and bought a Linksys adapter ( owned by Cisco ) which worked awesome .  
1	  This is a piece of junk . Spare yourself the headache that comes with this product . Initially I could not get any installer who would use this bypass . I finally got one who explained to me why others would not want to use it , he gave it a try . Guess what ? the very next day , the car we installed it on had its battery run down because of this . It is also not safe because you 've to leave a spare ( valet ) key in the bypass . We bought a new one for $ 65 which has been working just fine . Amazon , please stop recommending this junk with the key-less entry systems you sell .  
1	  It 's hard to imagine how a simple cable could suck , but this has it nailed . Both the 800 and the 400 ends of the cable fit very loosely , so the slightest movement causes the connection to be temporarily broken . For most firewire devices , this means that the device will lose synch , interrupt whatever you were trying to do , and spend a painfully long time trying to re synch with the computer . It doesn't help that the cable is as stiff as a coat hanger , so the slightest movement will move the connectors . If anything touches this cable it will break the connection , so you end up tip-toeing around this thing trying to keep it happy . Yes , it does work . If you have to get from 400 to 800 , it will do it . But this one is guaranteed to make you angry .  
1	  It is supposed to work under Windows XP / sp1 , I had struggled hard to install it . XP just can not recognized it , I had to manually select the driver for it , XP can not choose the proper driver from the installation directory . If your system is XP / sp2 , you have to follow the FAQ instructions on their website to install it . I doubt if they did necessary test before put it into the market .  
1	  Not purchased at Amazon . The CD player didn't work at first . I 'm going to let this cd play before I pack it up to be returned . Luckily I have a plan " B " It 's just junk from head to toe . If you really hate the person you have to buy a gift for this is the right item to buy . Flimsy wiring . The speakers are non-existant in weight and quality . No bass , no controls . The tuning knob crunches along like an old rusty tube radio . This would have been my first Coby item .  
1	  I have had this printer for less than one year . Now , 9 months later , it clips pages , the alignment mysteriously is off all of a sudden and it has slowed more than half in speed . As if this isnt enough I have had to re-build my parents HP tower . Buy a Mac and a Cannon . Best duo ever .  
1	  For speakers this inexpensive , it 's hard to quibble about sound , yet something 's wrong when even low expectations aren't met , especially given the many positive reviews here . If you lived in 1910 , these would be the world 's best-sounding speakers . It doesn't take a genius to see the problem with that statement . No bass , too much midrange , not enough treble , distortion-prone at even reasonable sound levels , " plastic " sounding , and with virtually no controls to alter anything save for the volume , these Creative Labs speakers generate as much excitement as kissing your sister . So rather than go cheap , pay a Hamilton or two more and step into something that won't bring you down every time you turn them on .  
1	  I purchaser this card to pick up WiFi signal in my area . I installed this card , which advertises " Range eXpansion , " in a DELL Latitude and only get 8 - 10 % on the signal which is insufficient to connect to the internet . My 9 inch Asus Eee PC picks up a strong enough signal with its built in WiFi ( side by side with the DELL ) to easily connect to the internet . Given the size of this card I was expecting it to receive a better signal than the Eee PC mini notebook . The claim of " Range eXpansion , " is not accurate . I can only recommend this for close use to the wireless router . In any case I would not recommend this seller due to their return policy .  
1	  I 'm a long time DLink fan ( Love their Routers ) , but I 'm really disappointed in this product . This product still suffers from bugs even after firmware 1.07 ( 7 revisions later ) . The device still hangs at 94 % when formatting new drives and after trying all the work arounds it still fails to properly format a drive for me . Either way this product is slow and out of date today . You should only expect about 12MB / s with this product despite Gigabit Ethernet because it only has 32MB of ram . You 're better off buying the Intel SS4200-E NAS which has much faster transfer rates and can hold 4 drives for about the same price .  
2	  The product was exactly what I needed . For a supposedly hard to find item this was easy and the pricing was very reasonable . If the opportunity presents itself again I will not hesitate on using this supplier .  
1	  This product is for older iPods only . I bought 3 of them for my family and none of them worked because the iPods ( 1g Nano , 2g Nano , 5g iPod ) don't have " dock connectors " . Only older iPods have these things . Since they 're not sold by Amazon , I had to get an RMA from the vendor and ship them back at my own expense . I guess this is why the price is so low .. One that works with current iPods costs more than 3 times as much .  
1	  I opened the box and saw those descriptions were missing from the Amazon product descriptions : From Tamron manual in the box - " For best results , use the Tamron tele-converter with telephoto lenses ranging from 50mm to 135mm . " When used on Digital SLR cameras : This teleconverter is not designed for digital use . We do not guarantee its performance when used on Digital SLR cameras . "  
2	  very good tv and the shopping experince was superb very professinal . delivery was on time and well done . so far so good on the tv of course im comparing it with my old tv but i would find it hard to believe one could get a better picture .  
2	  Looking at the Klipsch and its size can definitely be misleading . I bought this for downstairs just to have music when we are in the Kitchen . Boy does this thing have some thump and sound quality to it .  
2	  I really liked the idea of the slingbox . I travel , and I have a pocketPC phone , so the idea of being able to access my TIVO from an airport using Cingular 's 3G network , or from a hotel room using my laptop was very appealing . It works great ! Here are some tips and other information you might find useful : 1 . Slingmedia 's support is terrific . I found the process of the initial set up very confusing , as the instructions and setup wizard could not modify my DSL router . I tried to do it manually , following the directions , but the screenshots provided in the setup wizard didn't match my router 's homepage . Anyway , I went to slingmedia 's website and found the technical support option and clicked the " chat " option . Within a few minutes , the technician took over my computer and remotely set up my router to work correctly . Since then , it has been very easy to add devices to receive the Sling signal . 2 . To watch on a laptop , you have to be able to download software to your laptop : if you are using a company laptop , for example , you need administrative rights to install . 3 . Write down your Slingbox 's password . 4 . Slingbox apparently takes a lot of resources on your computer . Trying to surf the internet while watching a program really slows down your internet connection - lots of timeouts on pages . 5 . Before you buy , scope out your location . The slingbox needs to be near your AV equipment , as well as near your router . ( You have to have a wired router - slingbox doesn't support wireless - and not just a cable modem or DSL modem . You have to have a highspeed modem , AND a router . I have a DSL modem that has a wireless and wired router built in , a Westell DSL modem from AT & T ;) . Slingmedia sells some extra equipment to allow hook ups where your router is in a different room , but I have no experience with that . Also , the computer requirements are pretty high - 1 gig processor minimum . I don't quite get this last part . Sling works well with my cell phone / pocket PC so I don't know why they set the minimum requirements so high . 6 . The program to make you pocketPC work costs about $ 30 and can be downloaded from the slingmedia website . This is , of course , in addition to the cost of the Slingbox . 7 . Once you own it , you own it . No monthly fees . Just the normal cable or satellite / tivo charges . If you travel with a laptop or with a pocketPC ( a palm version is in beta testing , from what I understand ) you will be happy with the purchase .  
1	  These are pricey headphones . I expected quality and I hoped for comfort . I got neither . Specifically , these headphones are very bright ( louder highs softer mids and lows ) . This can be somewhat corrected with an equalizer but that 's kind of a pain to have to do for everything . Most disappointingly , I found a heavy sibilance that I just couldn't ignore . As fare as comfort , these things are like a vice for your skull . If I didn't wear glasses I might have been able to get used to the pressure . But I do wear glasses and I didn't pay this much for headahces .  
1	  Grainy ISO 100 pictures at any light conditions . Usage of 5mp and low sharpness options partially solves the problem , but if you take pictures with Panasonic DMC-FZ7 and compare .. it will be clear that a garbage trash is the right place for this camera . I had Panasonic DMC-FZ7 and the only cons . is really noisy high ISO sensitivity mode . In FZ8 camera Panasonic implemented the Venus II processor ( FZ7 has Venus II processor ) . As a result picture quality really improved at high ISO sensitivity modes but DRAMATICALLY changed for the WORSE in ISO 100 mode .  
1	  I have owned several Canon digital cameras and like them very much . I purchased the A520 as a gift for a family member . After several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening . It would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open . The key word being stick or stuck . I took it to a Canon Service Center and they repaired it under warranty . After trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge . I took it back to the Service Center and they repaired it again . While looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty . It was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time . After emailing Canon they said to just email them if I have a problem and they would see what they could do . Very POOR . I like Canon digital cameras but wish I had never purchased the A520 . I bought it because of it 's low price , which was a big mistake .  
2	  First let me say I have straight hair so use a brush dryer to smooth out my hair and give a little curl at the end . I 'm not trying to create big curls . I 've used brush dryers for years . I think this is my third or fourth one . I just bought the Conair BC171 to replace a similar ( non Ionic ) version that has been a workhorse for years . I think I had my other one at least 5 years - maybe longer . It 's still working but the bristles have seen better days . After years of very faithful service , it needed replacing . When I knew i had to replace my old one , I first bought another Conair at Target . But it had NO POWER . It was about like having someone blow on your hair . I returned it . Then , I bought a similar looking Revlon dryer . But it allows most of the hot air to blow out at the bottom of the brush attachment with very little air to actually style / dry your hair . Then the attachment quit staying in place and would come out in my hand . So , another brush dryer returned . At this point , I 'm seriously hoping I can find a Conair like the one I had . Searched Amazon and boom - there it is . I 'm so thrilled . This one is just the right size barrel - it allows you to kinda grab your hair and style it . It has plenty of power to get the job done . And I really like the combo plastic and bristle brush attachment . For me , it works the best . I 'm not big on leaving loong product reviews but i figure there are other women out there frustrated just like I was .  
2	  The Terk TV senderTerk Technologies Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless 2.4 GHz A / V Distribution Systemis a marvelous little device to avoid renting a second cable box , especially if you have a second tv location with no cable wall outlet . Not complicated to set up , but consider where the big metal things are in your house ( a / c , fridge , file cabinets ) and keep them out of line of sight transmission for best reception .  
1	  This product is terrible . I cannot get the thing to stay on a station , it jumps all over the place . For some reason the FM doesn't work at all and it is built really cheap . I expected alot more for my Thirty bucks .  
1	  I purchased this item to check out the state of the art for amateur night vision gear . The item is extremely bulky for something that does so little . It also has a very cheap feel about it . Can't imagine carrying this around with me anywhere , it 's just not very compact . The power button is also a little too stiff and requires a very deep push . The infrared lamp is absolutely necessary for seeing in those instances where the human eye cannot . As for low light , the monocular is useless . I can see better with my own eyes than through the lens . The seller was fine . The item reached me with packaging that looked a little worn , but it didn't matter considering the less than valuable contents within . Incidentally , the monocular came with a pouch which was unnecessary since I 'm more than happy to kick it around the floor along with my socks .  
1	  I 'm a mom of six kids . I 'm a cheapskate . I bought this because it was seemingly such a good deal . We don't have alot of money to throw around , and this was really my one chance to upgrade . I 'm so disappointed . The on light stopped working within weeks . the dial stopped working shortly after that . Now , less than a year after purchasing it , the thing doesn't work at all . My husband is really handy with wiring things up , and he can't even get this piece of junk to work . DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID ! Spend a little more for a brand you can trust !  
1	  I should have heeded the previous warnings . The only thing more frustrating than wasting my time and money on this is hearing the girls ask for the one hundreth time if it works yet . Buy a real DVD player and paint it pink .  
2	  I ordered these binoculars through Amazon . com on 7/21/11 and they were at my door at 7/23/11 . Great service , Amazon ! I have tried them out and they are excellent and just what I needed . Clear , compact , excellent quality . I highly recommend .  
1	  The quality of the scans is good when it works but the software keeps crashing and there is no technical support for the product - very annoying !  
2	  Needed to get an HD signal on my PC 's monitor , it works great . Haven't had any problem , HD 720p videos look fantastic . And is much cheaper than many other brands . Fantastic video quality for the price .  
2	  This inexpensive UV filter is a cheap insurance policy for the optics of your lens . I carry a couple spares in my camera bag .  
1	  I did read the reviews on Creative and this player , and thought I was getting a good deal when I bought it . The player was less than 3 month old when it started to freeze up and all the resets and software downloads Creative directed me to , did not fix the problem . I want to send it back to them as it is still under warranty but I cannot read the serial number on the product so they will not accept it . I am going to buy an Apple iPod - should have done that in the first place .  
2	  I have this screen in my living room with multi-pane doors to the side ; I only have problems with light when the sun shines through the glass directly onto the screen . When I get curtains for the doors , the problem will be solved .  
1	  Big box - one pen . I 'm not sure what the " 10PSC In A Box " means . The one pen looks & works as well as the OEM pen did .  
2	  No , it doesn't look exactly like the picture , like others noted . But it works fine and I got it in two days . Very satisfied .  
1	  Pros for the 2TB LaCie external drive ? When working it is quiet . And , when under warranty , they happily repair it . I know , because the one I bought has crashed twice and had to be sent back . It is back now , fixed again , but I don't trust it enough to put any more data on it .  
2	  I love this Zune , big and bright screen , far more better sound than ipod ( wish i gave to my wife after playing with my friend 's Zune , and i got one ) , sensending pictures to my friends wiressly . cool colors . big and bright screen , oh wait already said that . i put the background i want . great organization of the menu items and really easy to use . like i said i love it !  
1	  First off , one caveat : I bought this unit " Denon Factory Refurbished " ( NOT from Amazon ) . It never worked properly . All I can say is NEVERR buy anything refurbished . This is the second time I have done so and BOTH times the units have not worked . Also , beware on this unit if you do buy it . It is shipped with two shipping screws on the underside that MUST be removed BEFORE you try to use the unit .  
2	  Product came and works great ! It was exactly what the picture showed . I am satisfied with this order . Thank you  
1	  La se & ntilde ; al de este trasmisor es muy debil para utilizarlo en automovil . No lo recomiendo .  
1	  My 550 lasted 12 weeks and then froze up completely . There was no trauma whatsoever . After 5 weeks I found out that it cannot be repaired . The red eye with indoor flash makes the photos useless unless you want to use software to correct each photo . I bought this camera because of the good reviews on Amazon but after researching online , I find that many have had similar problems . While it was working , the outdoor photos were very good .  
1	  I love the security of knowing the camera is water resistant , and the battery life is so good I have hardly ever used the second battery I purchased . But .. it has a big flaw , one in common with other Olympus products . If you hand the camera to someone to take a picture .. 99 times out of 100 .. they will accidentially turn the camera off . The slide switch is annoying , overly sensitive , and very very fragile . If ( or when ) it breaks the repair charge is a minimum $ 125 . Flash pictures are another issue .. they always come out with wierd yellowish colors . Overall I 'm just barely satisfied with this model , and very unhappy when compared to my prior ( stolen ) Canon PowerShot .  
2	  I was really looking forward to receiving this digital picture frame in the mail . I was like a little kid ( and still am ) when I opened the Amazon . com shipping box , to reveal the colorful Kodak packaging with the long awaited digital picture frame in it . The digital frame was well packaged , protected with its own wrapping within the box , and a thin transparent sheet protecting the screen . Nothing the postman could have done could have damaged the product during shipping . The digital frame comes with a CD , for both Windows and Macintosh , and allows you to install in ten different languages : English , French , German , Italian , Spanish , Portuguese , Polish , Czech , and Turkish . During installation , you will be prompted on whether you would like to check the internet for a newer version of the software . I found that a newer version was available , and that was automatically downloaded and then seamlessly installed . The software is very easy to use and will automatically search your computer for all stored pictures . Within seconds ( depending on how many pictures you have ) you will have all your pictures neatly organized in one folder . A remote control , with battery included , is also in the package . It has a separate stand that attaches to the back of the frame , making it convenient to store your remote control . The remote control is a must , and turns the digital frame into a user friendly product . In fact , I didn't even have to read the owner 's manual . It is really very easy navigating the frame 's menus and settings . It is much easier setting this digital frame than your DVD player or microwave ! A few tips though : The remote buttons must be pressed hard and kept pressed for a good second ; you must be within a straight line and not too far away from the frame . If you are experiencing problems , change the battery . USB cables are also included to allow you to connect to your computer or directly to your digital camera . The USB cable will also allow you to upgrade the firmware on your digital frame . In order to upgrade your firmware , go to ww . kodak . com / digitalframesupport , choose your product , and then click on downloads and drivers . Once you download the new firmware , you must first unzip it on your computer , then connect your computer with your digital frame with the included USB cable , and transfer the unzipped ` img ' file by dragging and dropping it on your memory card ( which is not included ) inserted in your digital frame . Then it is a simple three step method of going to your frame 's menu , then to ` settings ' , and clicking on ` upgrading the firmware ' . Once the firmware is upgraded , you need to switch off your digital frame , wait 5 seconds , and then turn it back on . You should check every month for a new firmware for your frame and EasyShare software updates for your computer . I noticed a few important improvements once the new firmware was installed . The pictures were clearer ; there were no more any error messages while displaying the pictures , and more of the pictures were displayed when ` fit to screen ' was selected . I highly recommend you check for a firmware upgrade as soon as you receive your digital frame . A unique feature is that you can also communicate wirelessly with your digital frame , allowing you to share your pictures with your home network . This is really a neat feature that is fun , convenient , and just simply cool ! Your digital frame can also access the internet wirelessly and keep its internal clock set to the correct time . This is useful when you set your frame to switch on only at certain times . For example , you can schedule your frame to display pictures only during the day , and automatically turn off at night , only to resume displaying pictures again in the morning at a specific time you determine . This is a unique feature that is energy saving , and will give your frame a longer life than simply keeping it on all the time . As mentioned above , no memory cards are included on which to record your pictures . The digital frame will accept the following memory cards : SD , MS , xD , MMC , CF , and MD . The frame has an internal 128 MB of storage , hardly enough for the savvy photographer . The memory cards need to be formatted first before you record your images on them . I first formatted my Sony SD memory card using NTFS , but my digital frame was unable to read it . This was before I did the firmware upgrade . When I formatted the memory card using FAT32 , the digital frame read my memory card and displayed the pictures . I am not sure whether future firmware upgrades would allow NTFS formatting , but this is not needed . Make sure you format using FAT32 ! Some additional nice features of this digital frame : the possibility of choosing different picture wipes and duration during the slideshow ; brightness control ; ability to print pictures directly from your digital frame ; audio background during picture display ; video display ; and fit to screen feature . This is really a great and very easy to use digital picture frame . It is so nice to watch all my travels , adventures , celebrations , parties , and gatherings that span a period of many years on one digital frame . Time really does fly ! And as your pictures will testify , life is beautiful . Peace and love to everyone , God bless you all , and may you have a long and healthy life preserved in pictures for generations to come to enjoy !  
2	  It takes time to master how to put it without bubbles , but once installed it is a relief how much better I can see the screen without the annoying reflections . Tips to install : Make sure you , the rag and the environment is as lint free as possible . You may want to double up your shirt sleeves so the static cling won't attract lint from your clothing . Thoroughly clean the iPad surface of finger prints , lint , and dirt . Keep a hair dryer blowing cold air at a distance to blow away any dust particles that may end up on your screen prior to the application . Peel the film off completely with clean hands . I used tape rolled into a loop to handle the four corners so as to avoid my fingers touching anything that may leave a lasting impression . First concentrate in aligning the film well , and don't get distracted by the bubbles . I used the bottom part where the button hole is as a guide to laying it down . You may need to peel it off several times until you get it right . Warning : each time you peel it off it picks up tremendous amount of static electricity so it is important that your environment is clean or you 'll attract more dust than a " Swiffer rag " mopping the floor . Once aligned start working your large bubbles out with the included cardboard card . I used the included rag and my credit card making a stiffer straight edge with the soft touch of the rag in between the card and the film . Some small bubbles will appear that can't be pushed out . Those , if looked closer , will most likely have trapped a spec of dust or lint . Work from the closest corner to the bubble and peel off just enough to reach the problem area , as instructed with the double sided tape , and with a fresh tape on your other hand or finger , reach in and use it to rid the film or screen from the dust by slightly sticking the tape to the problem areas . That way all the dust captured between the glass and film will transfer itself to the sticky side of the tape and you will slowly clear all the bubbles for a perfect finish .  
1	  Transcend 16 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6E [ Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging ] I bought this memory card and turned out to be corrupt . Keeps giving " memory card error " with my canon powershot sx 20is  
1	  I purchased a SM-BB8S after a lighting strike took out my modem , thinking I was now protected . On Dec9th we had a power disruption and energy surplus which the SM-BB8s did not stop . This resulted in over $ 600.00 damage to my computer and monitor . What makes this worse is Recoton / Acoustic Research / Thomson Inc . have lagged in the customer service dept . I 've made 7 phone calls to the 1-800 number and sent one fax as required in 6 weeks and have NO reply other then " we 're sory sir , but the claim is now in the Thomson legal dept . " ( they will not give out any information as how to contact the legal dept either ) . No one has ever called me back , no one has ever gave me more information , and every dead line as to when I will recieve a call or answer to my warrenty claim has passed . Find a company who backs their product up with a real warrenty , and who doesn't play games with thier customer service . This company doesn't deserve your money .  
1	  I decided to get a new printer for picture reproduction and small business projects . The printer shredded 40 % of the print jobs I sent . The roller jams the paper in back , forcing you to remove a panel and ripping the sheet from the teeth of this monster . It is like playing toy-tug with my dog . If it does not eat your print jobs , then the sheet is fed in cockeyed and it prints off kilter when a lucky sheet makes it out of this beast . I was very dissapointed after only one week of ownership  
1	  I purchased this item in order to modem hotsync my Handspring visor . It has NEVER worked . It locks up during the sync process at User name . I tried to contact the company who , per there web site only offer email support for the product . I finally had to call corporate headquarters to demand a replacement . To their credit , they did send me another modem . To their discredit , it had the same remarkable low quality and inherent inability to perform as the first . Fortunately they were consistant in quality . Unfortunately , the quality was extremely low . I guess that the modem , like the army commercial was " being all it could be " , however , like some soldiers , all they could be is simply not enough for the task at hand .  
2	  I bought these as a gift . I haven't listened to them myself , but they have gotten very good comments from the recipients . Portable , good enough sound , and loud enough to hear in a garage or other large space .  
2	  It 's Silver Thermal Compound . It works as advertised and keeps my CPU - Fan interface working great ! I would recommend it to anyone .  
1	  Received this synch cable and plugged it into my iPad . After only the second time the little release button on the 30 pin cable end broke off . Now I can no longer use the cable because it won't release from the iPad . JUNK !  
2	  I 've purchased about 6-8 of these specific HDMI cords from eforcity . When I received them , they were thinner cords than what I 'm used to seeing . Fortunately , they work just as well as the other HDMI cords I 've had . Had no problems with any of the cords . I use these to display Xbox 360 and PS3 consoles to PC monitors . Works flawlessly !  
2	  This is the best headset ( at least in this price range ) that I have found so far . Anything of a comparable price that I 've tried I haven't liked as much . For me , it 's mostly been a comfort issue , as anything else I 've tried for a similar price has not been comfortable for me to wear for very long . I use them for gaming , for Skype , Google Voice , music , pretty much anything I need earphones and / or a microphone for . I also haven't had any complaints from anyone chatting with me online when I use these . They 're lightweight , and don't crush my ears when used for a long period of time . I also really like the volume control and mic on / off switch that 's on the cord , it 's really convenient for customizing the volume for whatever you 're doing at the moment ( and turning off the mic , if you need to ) , as opposed to having to do it with the controls on the computer . The only flaw with these earphones , which is why I 'm on my second set , is where the wires connect to the jacks . They eventually pull loose over time , even if you 're relatively careful with them . However , it took years for my first pair to finally die even with that issue , so it 's not worth it to me to take a whole star from my overall review for that . In terms of people complaining about them falling off - my guess would be it 's all dependent on your head and how you wear them . I prefer to wear them with the band going over the back part of the top of my head , so it 's generally not an issue for me . However , anything I 've tried that never falls off also tends to crush my head / ears , so I would almost prefer something occasionally coming off as opposed to my ears starting to hurt from being squeezed too hard . Definitely my favorite headset so far !  
1	  If all you want is a digital tuner in the shower , and you want to buy 6 new dry cells every 2 weeks , this is the product for you ! I can't imagine how [ angry ] I 'd be if had bought this for the CD player .  
2	  Got this for around 2 months now and it is really a very comfortable backpack . I have a Canon rebel XTI with 3 lenses , polarising filters and tripod . They fit very snugly in the various compartments . There are a couple of other compartments ( with zippers ) to keep the battery , covers and all such small stuff which we never think about . The customer images uploaded give a good picture of how to fit the various stuff . It is a great buy . Definitely recommended !  
2	  Each and every time I mount this lens on my 1DS mark II camera , I 'm falling in love with Photography again . This Lens is super fast auto focus and deliver sharp and crispy images quality even at wide open F / 2.8 the IS functioning is all about for my handheld shooting on location without tripod , it works effectively and reliable . I can compare and rate this lens almost perfect like my Canon 85mm F / 1.2L but 70-200 IS USM is faster autofocus . With the zoom lens like this shooting on Manual mode is my favorite cause I can make the most beautiful pictures out of this lens . It wasn't true as some previous review said there is a problem with many lenses with serial number of UT08XX or earlier . Honestly ! Mine is UT04XX but it perfect and I will keep it till my last breath .  
2	  RCA 50Ft . 16 Gauge Speaker Wire . Great price for a lot of wire it became handy to hook up the Speakers to the A / V Receiver . The wire is thick and strong I like the fact that one strand is in white color on the insulation of one of the conductors so you know how to hook it up the same way at both ends , it makes it very easy , it does a good job ! The Speaker wire arrived very fast from Amazon . com with out any problems . Thank You  
2	  I don't know how I went so long without this set up . It works just as it 's stated . I used to spend a lot of time opening and closing computer cases swapping drives , no more . This works like a charm .  
1	  Hard to read . you have to get down on your knees to see it , if it would work . Look around for better one  
1	  Sure this frame seems like a good value .. lots of features at an affordable price . You may even have scored one at some after Thanksgiving Day sale like I did for even less than what Amazon lists it ( $ 49 at Herbergers ) . But features and price don't count for much if the end result is horrible . I needed only plug in my camera 's SD card for one minute to see this frame is a waste . I returned it to Herbergers a day after I tried it , before I made the mistake of giving this piece as a Christmas gift . For starters , don't bother getting any digital picture frame if the resolution is not at least 800x600 pixels . The resolution on this frame is quite frankly horrible . The second major flaw of most of the digital picture frames is the " widescreen " 16:9 ratio . If you are designing a digital picture frame , would you not design it for the aspect ratio at which digital cameras take pictures ? ! Most digital cameras take pictures by default at a 4:3 ratio . When this frame displays pictures from your card they are stretched to the 16:9 ratio , thus distorting them . Sure there is a feature to display at a 4:3 ratio , but when I tried that setting , the frame over-compensated and squished the picture too much , thus distorting in the opposite direction ! You can also run your pictures through the mill and crop them all to the 16:9 ratio as some suggest . But when you are giving this to techno-phobe people as a gift , you want them to be able to simply slap the pictures on the frame and have those pictures display correctly , without a bunch of messing around . Yes you get what you pay for , and sometimes you need to expect less . But in the case of this frame , ANY amount paid is a waste of money for what you get . I ended up buying an 8 " 800x600 Westinghouse from BestBuy that was superb in every way to this Nextar dud .  
1	  This headset is identical to the old , A-0356A.Notice the 0356 in the product number . I have the original A-0356A , it 's a great product that lasted about 2 years before the ear piece broke off and I had to re-solder the wires together . Outstanding product . Overpriced because it has been on the market for at least 4 years .  
1	  This alarm clock has been nothing but trouble for me . First of all , it always is behind on the time and I have to fix the time every two weeks or so since it gets off by 5 to 10 minutes . Second , the first one I bought was defective and the buttons didn't work . I should have taken this as a clue because when I got the second one the buttons worked for about 6 months and then went out and now only some work and only half the time . Third , after a year of use , it no longer plays my iPod , which is the main reason I bought it . I 'd spend money on a higher quality unit since this doesn't work for the basic functions it is used for .  
2	  I did a lot of research before buying this player . And it paid off . If you want a good 5 disc player that plays CDR 's or VCD 's flawlessly ? Look no further . I primarily bought this to replace my CD Player which was dying and this full 24bit DAC sounds amazing . The bass defintion compaered to my old Technics is like comparing apples to oranges . THe Video is just as good for a player in this price range . Good features , fast loading , great sound and a good picture . A bit thin on scanning features but so what . The only con I have found , is the drive is a bit loud when playing DVD 's . So if your placing it very close to your viewing seat it could be annoying . Remote is fair , could be better . But it 's more than usable . I 'd buy it again !  
1	  200x film is just not very versatile . The Kodak quality pales in comparison to the cheaper 800x Fujifilm 4-pack , which gives chrystal clear pictures in most environments and is therefore highly versatile . Don't waste your money on Kodak .  
1	  It worked pretty well for about two weeks . Then the clip broke off , and I had bought it mainly for the clip ( the case seemed like a good idea too ) . So basically I wasted my money . The case itself is fine , although you can't adjust the volume , and it 's difficult to open the case if you want to adjust the volume . I recommend not buying this .  
2	  I 'm not a DJ , but if I were I think that these would work great . They can be played very loud and are actually louder at the same volume level than other headphones due to a combination of factors I can't explain intelligently enough to even try . I imagine that would be a handy feature if you 're in a loud club or such . It seems that every part of these headphones adjusts , swivels , or otherwise moves so they can be grabbed off a table or from around your neck and slammed up against your ear quickly without having to figure out how to manipulate the earcups . Personally though , I bought these because I wanted a nice set of headphones for music and movies when I didn't want to be fiddling around with my Sony MDR-EX71SL / WK Fontopia Headphones ( in-the-ear headphones .. brilliant for the cash ) . I 'm not exactly an audiophile , but in my opinion on sound quality , these headphones sound EXACTLY like my Fontopia 's , which means they sound great . They do put some pressure on your ears , so extended wearing ( over 2 hours ) isn't exactly a treat . They look really good though , so I give them top marks in style . One added feature I found that I wasn't expecting was that I can plug them into my Ipod at work and set the headphones on my desk as external speakers . They sound great in that environment without requiring another power source . To be a bit more concise on my rating , here is how I would break it down as far as what was important to me when I was looking at these : Sound - 5/5Style - 5/5Volume - 5/5Comfort - 3/5I still give them a five because if I strictly used them as intended ( after all it does say DJ Headphones in the product name ) , I think I would give them a 5/5 in comfort since they are quite comfortable sitting around my neck where they would most often be . If not using these as DJ headphones , I would recommend these for good sound quality , volume and style . If anything else is more important than these three , I may not recommend them .  
2	  This piece of gagetry is a technical wonder ! The picture is amazing given the small screen . The headphone surround sound is awesome too . The only problem I have had with this is with the button to open the case to insert the DVD . It sticks a little and I have to use alot of pressure to finally get the thing open . Other than that I love it and love showing it off to my friends . Best investment in electronics I 've everdone . If its small screen size ( which is perfect for me ) bothers you than get the LV75 but it has all the same features .  
2	  After using Macs in college and for some of my professional life , I 've been a slave to the PC for the past 6 years . After getting fed-up with my Win98SE locking-up every day , I leapt for the iMac , in part because of the promise of the iPod . What a difference a day makes . I can now surf the net , listen to music and transfer tunes to my iPod without incident . With my PC , I was lucky to have multiple windows open while surfing . Try to open MusicMatch and I 'd lock-up . MusicMatch also had the annoying problem of inserting a clicking noise in the background of CDs that I burned . With iPod , I am free of my CDs completely . I have over 200 CDs on my new iMac and can transfer them to my iPod in seconds . The critics of the iPod are those running on Windows . Go figure .  
2	  Order this item directly from Eton website . Cost is 9.95 plus 6.95 for shipping .  
2	  I needed this for work to put under my desk because I only have 2 standard outlets . This was perfect , it fits right where I needed it without being in the way or causing any hazards . Now co-workers want one , so I directed them right to you ! AWESOME !  
1	  I 've used many digital cameras and when this one came out , I was poised to be thrilled . Read the reviews , tested it out in the store against other cameras , and bought it . I wanted a high-quality camera that shot RAW files and was more portable ( i.e. , no bag full of lenses to haul around ) and versatile than my older cameras . The thrill lasted for about three months . Then I started having some trouble stabilizing the image-even on a tripod I was getting blurring . At first I thought it was just me-too much coffee , maybe-but my tests are showing a definite focus problem . The problem is ( not surprisingly ) especially acute in low light / high ISO situations . Focus is extremely slow-as long as 25 seconds-and the camera keeps " hunting . " My old 4MP Olympus pocket camera easily outshines this 8MP camera that cost much , much more . Camera repair shop simply said , " Yes , focus is a problem with this camera , " which wasn't much help . What a disappointment ! I 've used Nikon film cameras for the last 25 years and love them . This is my first digital Nikon , and from what I 've seen so far there 's no comparison . If you have one ( say , an FTN ) , keep it and buy a digital film recorder instead .  
1	  I upgraded to N1 for our house because it is adobe ( earth brick ) and have had trouble with attenuation on my previous router . N1 works no better - about 20 feet thru 2 walls knocks it out . I bought a Buffalo AirStation ( WLI-TX4-G54HP ) and it works much better - even though it 's not N1 !  
2	  I just purchased a a 13 " laptop and purchased this sleeve . It fits perfect ! And has gotten alot of attention .  
2	  These headphones sound absolutely claer and dynamic . The sound is full and bright ; the bass not overpowering . They are very light and comfortable . The asymmetric cord takes getting use to . The downside is that every movement of the cord gets transmitted into the earphones . So they are great if you are sitting and reading while listening to music , not so great if you are excercising .  
2	  Our public library requires windows operated MP3 Player . So there was only a few different choices . I have been extremely happy with my purchase for the purpose I bought it for . I put a book on it . The " keys " are flat and covered with the case , so there is no concern of getting gummed up keys . It is easy to bump a key and have it do something not wanted . So once I start listening to the book , I lock the keys , so I don't bump them . I 'm happy with my purchase .  
2	  I 'm completely satisfied with the camera . I purchased a total of 6 cameras for my siblings who are located throughout the United States and all of the cameras have been working great . I also purchased the Life Cam-6000 and found that it was not worth the money . We use the Skype software with the cameras and the 3000 works great . I would suggest the 3000 over the 6000 if you are using the camera for simple on-line calls .  
2	  I was going to originally re-order a different brand of ear buds that I loved , or at least I thought I loved . I saw these and knowing Sennheiser I knew that had to be pretty decent . And for the price I decided to give them a shot . These ear-buds are perfect ! They have amazing sound , they fit perfect and dont slip out . My other ones would slip out when I wore them to the gym , yet these ones stay in even with a head full of sweat . IF YOU NEED EAR-BUDS , GET THESE !  
2	  This product is well-designed and easy to set up . It comes with 8 tabs in which you use to keep the filter in place . The tabs use a sticky solution to stick to the border of your monitor - it is very easy to set up . The filter is double-sided . There is a glossy and matted side . The product works as advertised . The angles of privacy are accurate . Also , for those who are looking for a product to reduce glare , it works very well for this . I have suffered from tension headaches and believed my glossy laptop screen was partly to blame . After getting this , my eyes are less strained than normal while working on my computer . If you need something to do this , you should definitely try a screen filter to lessen the gloss of current screens .  
2	  Based on reviews of this and less expensive filters of this type I decided to go with the " best " . I didn't want to get a basic model just to wish I had a better filter . I didn't waste my coin on a spendy clear filter just to protect the lense . The polarized lense is supposed to enhance the photos so I decided not to waste time getting a less expensive filter . Spending $ 1100 on a lense deserves a great porized filter . I 'll keep it on most of th time since I live in sunny Arizona .  
1	  When i first got the sub two of the wiring harness came off . Also was a first time user of a DVC sub and the terminals aren't labeled at all . After about two weeks of having it installed in my car it blew . I would not recommend this sub now i 'm having to save money for another sub . I 'm going for a Kicker this time . It 's cheap and thats the only good thing about it . spend a bit more for something that is quality .  
1	  the warrenty on this device is only 3 months and it breaks quite quickly . the cover kept popping off and when it broke creative said the warrenty ran out  
2	  I bought three so far . It has huge amounts of space and is very fast . I see no reason to pay any more than this for a Class 6- 8GB SDHC card .  
1	  I have several problems with this product # 1 The drive wouldn't detect . After looking up further instructions on their site I changed the jumper settings . After that it failed to start up again despite trying all jumper settings and trying many times . # 2 Instructions were written by retarded monkeys . Here 's an excerpt : " Once u connecting the enclsoure with hard disk in it to your computer , cpmputer system will assign .. " The spelling errors are authentic , and they really used " u " several times .. # 3 The instructions tell you to " open the top cover of the enclosure " , without any indication of what the top cover is . Unless you just guess well you 'll end up taking the whole thing apart . DO NOT BUY !  
2	  I bought this to hook up stuff to a new FIOS connection where the house has Ethernet connections throughout . It works - nothing more need be said . I don't remember whether this went to the WD Live or is used with the wireless modem ( used for the Galaxy S3 to bypass the data plan ) . It works great .  
1	  This router should be used for low volume traffic only . I bought two of these , one for my home office and one for a client 's office . The setup was easy and router , dhcp , firewall , wireless and ethernet were all fine on the weekend . Monday morning was a disaster ! The traffic from 10 clients overwhelmed the device and dhcp was failing and throughput was in the [ .. ] . I thought the device was faulty and swapped it for the one at home that was working fine for two client PCs . Same results . Now we use the office befw11s4 as a wireless access point only . Also , I 've experienced certain ports being blocked that shouldn't have been according to the settings .  
1	  I produce approx . 200 dvds a week . I buy inexpensive cases all the time .. but these take the cake ! I have bought better from the dollar store ( 4 for $ 1 ) . About every fourth case I " try " to open breaks . HUGE waste of money , there are cheaper cases out there that are much better quality . I really hope that the ones that did not break for me won't break for my customer .  
1	  Don't count on this piece of cheap junk to sound decent or work longer than a few days . I had a problem with it from day 1 , which was the middle of last month . First off it kept ejecting until I persisted pushing it back and and it stuck and played . It did play my MP3 for a while , but made a loud clicking noise ( after reading other reviews , I guess this was the gears ) that was loud enough to ruin what ever music you could hear . I only got it to work a few times , today it decided to not play at all . Every time I push it in , it ejects .. over and over and over .. I give up . Might try to send it back to Amazon , not sure if it 's worth it . Basicly I got what I paid for , a cheap piece of junk .. buyer beware and buy elsewhere .  
1	  When I tried to put music on my PSP maybe 10 or so got by the corrupt data , so out of 4GB only a few MB actually didn't get corrupted , a sad sad day indeed . pass it up and get a sandisk , your data will thank you later .  
2	  Although the anti-aging claims are true , I am somewhat disappointed that my skin is now almost identical to one of my wife 's handbags . Methuselah  
2	  If you order this radio , Be advised that the AC adapter is not included , if you read the discription you are lead to believe that the AC adapter is included . 1st impressions with the receiver , it appears to be fairly easy to operate , I immediately began using without referencing the manual , and was finding short wave stations almost immediately , only knock , is it is a bit overpriced .  
2	  I bought this for my new Canon HF100 . And I found out that its too big . But it was not a problem . I put my Canon A610 in the bag together . I liked it because I put all the cables there .  
2	  My wife bought this in 2009 and used it for about 2 1/2 years 24/7 . It got noisy so we assumed it was time for a new one , the Cooler Master NotePal U2 . I then put it on my laptop and it is still going . The Cool master by design is probably a better design .  
2	  These binoculars are great buy ! Our family has two pairs of the 8x42 ( and one pair of the 10x42 . ) I use them for watching birds . They produce a very crisp , clear image with bright colors . They are fairly heavy , and are made with solid construction . They also come with a comfy neck strap and case . I would highly recommend these binoculars for anyone interested in quality optics at a good price .  
1	  looks fine , but doesn't work fine . causes picture on tv to " blink " same with home theater system . tried different cable , no probs . cheap isn't always better !  
2	  I originally bought an Apple Airport Express , which was great , but as it 's limited to playing only music through iTunes , I returned it for this item . Now I can stream online radio such as Pandora and play streaming video using other software to speakers elsewhere in the house . Pretty much plug and play connected to the laptop - just didn't realize initially I had to connect it from the laptop headphone socket to the 2 RCA jacks on the transmitter part , then connected PC speakers to it . The receiver is sat in the basement hooked up to an amplifier and in house speaker system , so both the speakers connected to the laptop via the transmitter and the speakers around the house are all playing . Only downside is having 2 units - one to the PC controlling the music and one elsewhere controlling other zones . No trouble with wireless as some have reported . It is recommended to keep the transmitter at least 3 ft away from your PC if it has wireless . For the current price , it can't be beat .  
1	  the color was acceptable , however the size was not fit enough . Therefore , the camera case will look not elegant as I thought .  
1	  This player basically does nothing but make its owner jump thru hoops . Can you say work around ? That 's what you 're in for . Can't play most formats . I haven't found a video format yet that it will play . Try creating a playlist and you might end up throwing it thru a window . Why doesn't this company create some software to run this player like everyone else does ? The interface is made for a baby 's fingers ( e.g. , the not so joyful STICK ) .. AND .. the remote will give you Carpal Tunnel from repeated pressing over and over with no results . ZEN 's and IPODS are a pleasure to use after this thing .. WOLFIE is way over priced for what you get .. CONS : Everything about it . No redeeming qualities .. Pros : Still looking .. but I 've pretty much given up . BUY THIS IF YOU want to be frustrated .. I would give this a zero star rating if I could .  
1	  Save yourself the money and effort , buy a generic USB 2.0 reader from one of the major manufacturers for half the price .  
1	  I use Windows 7 Home Edision 64 bit . After lots of effort , the connection is still on and off . Besides , the company technical support has little help .  
1	  I purchased this card for my keyboard , with hopes that it will work like the one I currently have - for a back up . It doesnt work . Never has , and it seems it never will . I tried to contact the seller and they were no where to be found . The product they gave me was a ' dud ' and now they cannot be reached . NEVER BUY anything from this seller , unless you want silence for a response .  
1	  After initially not working , this unit all of a sudden started working after a couple days . Then worked great for about 3 weeks although had to keep changing batteries every few days . Now it hasn't worked for months although I keep trying . What a pain walking around the corner for direct sight every time I want to use the remote . I 'm throwing this in the trash and buying another product today .  
1	  I purchased the DynaDock ( DVI version ) about a month ago . I use it with two fairly new ( 10 month old and 5 month old ) Toshiba laptops . I followed the install procedures and got the dock " working " with both PCs . Things to be aware of include : 1 . With a 22 " monitor ( 1600X1050 resolution ) leaving the video color setup at 32 bit causes the windows to open and close very slow and choppy ( setting it at 16 bit eliminated this problem ) 2 . Once you install the dynadock software onto a laptop - every time you boot up that laptop ( including awaking from sleep ) the screen will flicker for about 5 seconds at bootup ( annoying ) 3 . The process of " ejecting the dock " never seems to work 100 % 4 . Entering / awaking Vista sleep is not 100 % reliableOverall - the dynadock is OK - but it needs some more work before its ready for the mainstream computer user . Its still too finicky with its current software / hardware version .  
1	  After several tries , we haven't figured out how to use this adapter with our computer . The CD that comes with it isn't loading on our computer and so the purchase hasn't been used .  
2	  This remote is awsome , when no other universal remote had a code for my Limited edition Sylvania HDTV i was upset but when i found out that i couldnt even get a universal remote to work wtih my sony 5DVD player / amplifier / reciever i became ver fustrated i came online to see what u could find for learning remotes and this one hit every key without a problem now instead of fussing around with 4 remotes to get a good HD movie playing with all the sound i just simply use the Kameleon Its awsome and i love its modern look . I only give it 4 stars because after eading some of the other reviews i dont doubt for a second that this remote is going to eat and swallo batteries .. but definatley worth it .  
2	  The screen works perfectly ! If you take your laptop everywhere , this is a must have .. even going into meeting at work . It does get dusty rather quickly which just mean that you have to wipe it more . Not something to stop you from buying it !  
1	  Worked fine for a month . Then it stopped reading some discs . Now it won't play anything . " Disc cannot be played . " Even on brand new movies .  
2	  I didn't have any problem with the U3 software on the various desktop and laptop computers I tried it on ; it doesn't seem to have infested my usual work machines with any problematic software . The available U3 software is a bit sparse , but what 's there seems to work , and more will be developed . I have another Sandisk thumbdrive with PortableApps ; I think this tool is nearly as good . The drive itself is well-constructed ; I expect it to last a long time .  
1	  I purchased a 995 last Dec 1st and have yet to get the promised .. rebate . I 've made many telephone calls and as near as I can find out Nikon sent the rebate to the WRONG STATE . Based on a lot of reviews I also purchase a lot of accessories for this camera and am very displeased ! The LCD can not be seen in ordinary daylight and thus you will not be able to use the menu system . Don't buy any of the add on lens as they block the optical view finder and again the LCD is useless in daylight . If you want to take photos on nice sunny days find another product .  
2	  I have all my components hooked up to this power conditioner . I does a good job of regulating voltage ( I have no means of testing the filtering and surge protection ) . Amazon ( as always ) did a great job of delivering the product in two business days ( I 'm a prime member ) . I think that APC , however , needs to get with program and recognize ALL the potential sources of surges and spikes such as through HDMI and Ethernet cables . This device does not filter these items . I NEED to be fair and say that I knew this before my purchase . To me the APC power conditioneer is the best product for the money spent ( I DO have a budget ) . Take a look at the APC site and compare the suggested price with the Amazon price .. Great job Amazon !  
2	  get it right now , it was the best thing i ever owend .. and at a good price  
1	  I would love to write you a review of my new Kodak C800 Advantix Camera which I purchased from Cambridgeworld on 6/9/07 . However to date ( 7/13/07 ) I have still not received my product and so have no idea how good it is . I am getting very little help or answers from the seller so I am very frustrated and annoyed at this stage . I hope that is not an indication of the trouble I would have with the camera ( IF AND ) when it does arrive .  
2	  I have tried three times to get instructions for return of the item I purchased in good faith from this company . To date I have not had a response . I asked for return informtion or a call tag to retun the ink cartridges that are not for my printer and would not work if I tried to pound them into the machine . The are totally the wrong thing . I am still waiting for them to do the RIGHT THING and return my money . I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN . THIS WAS MY FIRST AND ONLY TRIAL OF USED AND REFILLED INK .  
2	  These SD cards worked as expected in my trail cameras . The cards I was using were larger capacity and the cameras did not work well for one reason or another . The manufacturer reccommended 2 GB or less for optimal operation .  
2	  The cable just snapped in and is working I do not know why you would pay any more . The cable itself is quite stiff and thin so I would be careful not to bend it too much or I guess it could break .  
2	  I have not had any problems with this printer . I have had it for just over a month . I have not needed to use the fax so I can not comment on that . Setup was quick and easy . The 4x6 pics are wonderful . The software that comes with it has red eye reduction , and it is the best I have ever seen . At this point I am very satisfied with my choice . I am also very impressed with Amazon and will do more ordering from them in the future . My printer arrived in just two days .  
1	  Not Original cables to go , contacted 2 times by email and nothing . I know that some reviews that is just generic , but I will say that is worse than generic  
2	  Some other reviewers have complained about not being able to fit their 17 " ( diagonal measurement ) laptop into this bag . I can tell you that my 17 " Acer laptop ( which weighs an ungodly 9lbs ) does fit , albeit barely . 17 " laptops will fit , but I think the bag was intended for 15.4 " or smaller . Those who claim their laptop will not fit may not be aware of the top , inside laptop opening . This bag provides two access points to the laptop , one on the side and one in the top under a velcro flap . I did manage to get all my camera gear into this , without using any of the top compartments . My gear includes a Canon Rebel XT w / 18-55 lens , a 55-250 IS lens , a 50mm portrait lens , one flash , various filters and extra batteries + charger . The bag has straps on the bottom for a tripod as well as extra pouches on each side ( which I 'm currently not using ) . The top flap snaps into place on the front . I had a concern with this thinking that lifting the bag by the handle ( which feels very secure , by the way ) would cause the snaps to come undone , but the bag is designed well . The handle is more attached to the back of the bag than to the front flap , so lifting by the handle feels just as secure as lifting by the shoulder straps . I recently took this bag on a trip to Boston and aside from my camera gear , also packed my ipod , laptop + accessories , and a full-size hard-back book . It kept my camera gear safe during the flight while still providing plenty of room for my on-board entertainment . Other reviewers have complained about the straps used on this bag ( double-ring tension ) , but I have to say I like the straps on this better . These straps won't break where a plastic buckle would . I wouldn't call it the perfect camera bag , but it 's certainly a great bag for me .  
2	  This card was easy to install and worked flawlessly . Using Network high speed testing software the card demonstrated that it speeded up my Network connectivity dramatically .  
1	  We ordered 3 of the Sony Bravia Theater Systems . The first one was for my brother-in-law and worked just fine although it came w / a dented sub-woofer . The second one was for our family and after my husband ran all the wires and put up the speakers we turned on the system and all we got was a blue flash on our screen . We called Sony directly and after some trouble shooting , they told us it was defective and needed to be sent in for service . Since it was new , I returned it to Amazon and they sent us the third as replacement . Before we ran the wires I connected the system and it did the same thing . Again , Sony said we had a defective unit . Amazon was great at handling the whole thing . We returned the unit , got a refund and are waiting to buy another system .  
1	  Not compatible with the ipod classic . I called Altec Lansing and they confirmed this fact . Unfortunately it is not mentioned in any of the instructions or materials . Very disappointed . To return it I pay a 20 % restocking fee .  
1	  The tiny media cards arrived in a huge box .. so much for the environment . But more disappointing , one of the media cards is completely dead after just a few uses . I bought these to be used in a Canon digital SLR and a Dell PC laptop . One media card is completely dead and can't be read / formatted by either the camera or the PC . A quick internet search seems to indicate a similar problem with the Transcend cards for other users . Buyer beware .  
1	  Product came in used condition . Discoloration on the product surface . The glass surface of the filter had smudges and fingerprints on it . Sent a e-mail to adorama which responded they would send me a return label . Amazon responded that they wouldn't refund until the product is returned . All this trouble for a $ 10 filter . Don't by from Adorama . If you read other reviews on them they are hit and miss . The miss is how they turn a profit . Wonder why Amazon allows these type of vendor to sell through them .  
1	  I bought this amp and I HATE it . This component left BLACK , NON-removable , stained FOOTPRINTS on my once beautiful component table . Endless hassles for menu options that don't make sense , outputs that output for some things and not others ( for instance : their " multi-out " will only output cd sound , and if you were to listen to a DVD the sound would cease for no apparent reason ) . 5 channel stereo should pass analog signal , but it doesn't . So I tried the " tape " outputs , and the FM radio comes out too now ( hooray ! ) but still no DVD sound passes through the analog out . There is no method to their madness . The " hall " effect is horrible , turn it on and then put your head in between the center speaker and right-front to hear this horrid zig-zag featureless chop they call " hall " mode . uggh , I hate this amp .  
1	  The picture and description show that this an actual Canon ink cartridge , but what I received was a knock-off brand made in China in a yellow and blue box ! Buyer beware ..  
1	  Normally I don't mind buying third party products , but this cartridge was a complete waste of money . The toner cartridge has a roller that 's supposed to evenly apply the toner , and this one screeches and sticks , so that most pages have varying amounts of cyan . As an added bonus , the printer only recognizes it as a 1500 , not 4500 page cartridge . I 've learned my lesson . Instead of trying to save a few dollars , I 'm going to buy a cartridge that works .  
2	  Well , it might not be a very good quality printer , but hey , I bought a bunch of them when they were on sale at the local supermarket . They actually cost less than a new inkt cartridge for my other printer ( HP Designjet 120 ) . And still it prints out 1200x600 dpi , 8 pages b & w text with the optional black cart ( which I got for free when I bought the printers . And I must say , the prints look pretty good . Anyway , these printers are dead cheap and IMHO perfect for people who dont print very much , or like me , take it with me to LAN-parties and stuff ( you can't imagine how popular you are when you 're the only one there with a printer :) And hey , it 's so cheap that it doesn't matter if it breaks or gets nicked .. I throw mine out when the carts empty anyway :) Oh , and it is compact too , which is a big advantage when u are living on a boat :)  
1	  I was excited and even bought two ( one for me and one for my sister out of state ) . Then , I had weird pop ups and after looking around on the Internet , it looks like there might be a virus with the software . Unfortunately , I still don't have the issue resolved and the webcam is in the " techie dead pile . " Additionally , my sister has been having " registry " problems , which I think is due to the camera . DONT BUY .  
2	  All the features of an iPod Nano and more . My daughter absolutely loves it ! She 's gone through 3 different players and says this is the best by far .  
2	  The best features of this radio are its highly sensitive AM " front end " , the part that is responsible for the radio 's sensitivity , which in this case is excellent , and its sound . For a small case , this radio has a very pleasing sound-not tinny , and much better than its slightly larger cousin , the DT200V . Minuses ? Buttons could be arranged a little better ( the bass boost probably doesn't have to be so prominent ) and sound volume is a little too low on TV band .  
2	  I have several short wave radios , AM / FM radios . I listen to BBC and I found that instead of changing frequency numbers in my shortwave radio , I can listen to the same channel in the XM radio ( XM 131 ) crisp clear digital quality which my expensive shortwave radio can not provide . I was an avid listener to world music . I used to tune to Global Village in radio canada international . The producer kept changing the day and time . I had to be ready by 7 PM on Saturday to listen to only one hour of music brought from all over the world . This XM satellite radio and the high quality boom box brings world music to you for 24 hours in a 7 day schedule with digital quality music . Antenna reception in my geographic location is great . I wanted to take this boom box out while driving ( with battery power - 6 D cells ) . I kept the boom box on the floor between front and back seats . There is fading of signals specially while driving north . As an experiment , my wife held the boom box on her lap ( the box loaded with batteries is heavy ) , on the front passenger seat . The reception was better but none while driving north . Bottom line , one has to buy the receiver ( I had a good deal of $ 80 from Circuit City ) , the boom box ( $ 99 ) to listen to the music at home . Then buy a kit for fitting into the car ( additional $ 70 + professional help with a charge of $ 40 for installation ) . This will let you have proper antenna installation in the car . The cost adds up . But , like me , as a starter , I recommend this system for pleasure at home of listening to music , news , sports as a feast , which traditional am / fm radio can not provide commercial free and suitable for your taste . You can listen to National Public Radio 's super quality program ( not available in your am / fm radio 's standard npr program ) , blues , music from 50 's , 60 's etc , reggae music and much more . Monthly membership fee is $ 10 on top on other cost estimates I mentioned above . This is great stuff . I love it . I am just listening to it for about a week only .  
2	  With the transition to digital broadcasting on 2/17/09 I purchased a Panasonic VCR / DVD recorder combo and connected it to my Panasonic plasma TV with these cables . I had not made such a connection before and I wanted to have cables that would work right the first time and be worry-free thereafter . I purchased these cables because they were suggested by Amazon and because they received strong reviews from previous purchasers . I was not disappointed as they have performed just as advertised ! You can spend more , but you can't buy better .  
1	  I 've owned two of these models , and neither has lasted more than a couple of years . I won't make this mistake again . They seem prone to electronic glitches , refusal to read discs , faulty disc tray mechanism , and poor programming . My most recent failed model ( bought in 2008 ) would frequently not recognize a disc that had been inserted and skip over it . If there were multiple discs in the tray on random play , sooner or later it would refuse to play some or all of the discs . Then this past month it began to turn itself on - that 's right , TURN ITSELF ON , with the display lighting up . I 'd hit the power button to turn it back off and within the hour it 'd be back on again . After a day or two of doing this it began to freeze up on discs , skip , and generally freak out , the display flashing random digits and messages the disc tray refusing to open , and generally refused to accept input from the control buttons . I finally pulled the plug to disconnect all the active input ; plugged it back in after a resting spell , and then was able to force enough response to free my CDs . I 'll shop more carefully for a replacement this time - I 'm finished with Onkyo .  
1	  I 'm sure that if the camera worked properly , it would have been fantastic ; however , I received a camera on my birthday this year , only to have difficulty with the focussing mechanism . I took 4 blurry shots of my son 's birthday party , and the next time I turned the camera on , the LCD screen was broken . We purchased the extended warranty from Best Buy , so when I brought the camera ( 10 days old , mind you ) in for repair , they insisted that I 'd dropped it and broken it ( which I hadn't ) , even though there were no signs of external damage .. no scratches , dents or anything . After sending it in , Best Buy informed me that it would cost us $ 180 to fix , and that they wouldn't fix the focussing mechanism until I 'd paid for the LCD screen to be fixed . Disgusted , I retrieved my camera from customer service unfixed . I contacted Sony , who appologized and told me to send in my camera for free repair . I ended up receiving a call from their repair center , informing me that it would cost me $ 180 to repair and that LCD screens are not covered , whether I received it broken or not . I tried a third time for repair , only to be told that I would have to pay . My mother tried to use her Buyer 's Protection Plan from her Visa ( it was a birthday gift from her to me ) , only to have her money refunded , then re-charged months later when Best Buy 's legal department wouldn't pay her Visa bill . Based upon our experiences ( among other bad experiences with Best Buy ) , we stopped shopping at Best Buy , and now own a lovely Olympus camera . Don't buy the Sony Cybershot DSC-T9 !  
1	  I recently purchased the new 52 inch Samsung B750 ( from Amazon ) and picked up this HDMI cable as an afterthought . I figured it had over 2000 reviews , almost 5 stars , and was only 70 cents at the time . Plus .. all HDMI cables are the same right ? Great deal ! Wrong . I plugged it in only to see my new TV reading , " Check signal cable . " Frustrated , I went to pull out the cable and troubleshoot , but the metal casing stayed in the port , permanently disabling the cable ! Trash . Upon further research , I 've discovered there is in fact a difference between HDMI cables ( category 1 vs 2 , etc ) and that some of my friends have had similar experiences with this particular model . Sure , it costs almost nothing , but you 're better off buying a soda from the vending machine . With this cable , you definitely get even less than what you pay for . Buyer beware . Justin  
2	  This is a truly great product - I just put it in my Dell Inspiron 8100 and connected my USB 2.0 Maxtor 2000LE external harddrive and it works like a champ . The review by ' the great entity ' regarding not working with PC chipsets is completely incorrect - it almost caused me not to buy this product . Pay no attention - this card works as advertised . I also have an IO Gear KVM switch that I 'd also highly recommend - you can't beat the price , specs , or the fact that it includes all the cables for 4 devices . Way to go IOGear !  
2	  I am generally happy with this S3 , but as I have gotten older , and my eyes are dimenishing , I need a quality viewfinder . This one is electronic and suffers a clarity that I do not have in my other cameras - a digital rebel and old sureshot . At times I have taken pictures not knowing its focus , only to be pleasently pleased later on . The LCD is also not as good as I would wish . I think the IS is unbelivable , and its movie capabilities are amazing for its quality . I do not want to sound negative , but this has been my experience .  
2	  I 've had numerous camera bags and hard cases over the years , but never a Backpack style bag . This one looked good with all of its adjustable compartments , pockets plus the backpack features . So , I got one and I 'm glad I did . This bag is in daily use , getting pulled in and out of the car , carried around , unzipped and zipped , on average six days / week , often everyday - I don't go anywhere without my cameras . I usually just carry it by grabbing the left side shoulder strap and slinging it on . After a lot of regular use , nothing is getting loose , ripped or pulled apart . I 'm amazed because I 'm not easy on it . I keep waiting to see a rip somewhere , expecially on that left shoulder strap , but it hasn't happened . Also , the zippers have proven very durable with no sign of wear or potential for separation . For anyone looking for a backpack style bag , this is it - Plus , it has CANON on it and if you 're a Canon Camera " fiend " , like I am , you just have to have a bag that proudly says CANON !  
2	  UPDATE : March 26 , 2007Six months later , after I purchased this printer , I say BRAVO ! The only thing that I can say bad about it is the fact that it DRINKS INK ! However , all INKJETS drink ink . This is a very quiet printer and it has a great improvement over changing the 2 ink cartridges-very fast and easy compared to older HP Inkjet printers . September 19 , 2006Below is my report after just owning the printer for a few days : This is my 3rd purchase of an HP All-In-One Printer , Scanner , Copier . I owned the PSC ALL IN ONE 2100 for 3 1/2 years until it coughed and died last month . Then September 18 , 2006 , bought the F380 HP , it was dead on arrival . Said I would " NEVER " buy another HP . Well , I ended up bringing the F380 back and getting the HP C3180 . So far , so good . I have owned this printer since Sept 19 , 2006 and it is doing great as yet . Scans flawlessy , prints everything , including pictures perfectly . Printer is quiet and copies quickly ! The only things SO FAR that I can say negative about this is that it DRINKS INK ! The reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 : 1 ) Drinks Ink 2 ) I miss the old software that the previous HP All in Ones came with , the newer photo software is bare bones at best . Bought MS Picture It as it has more features . 3 ) Have only owned this about 3 weeks . I plan to do an update on this should it " DIE " on me .. Till then .. UPDATE : November 26 , 2006-Still working great ! This is one of the easiest to use printer / scanner / copiers that I have ever had ! I love the fact that each time you print , it gives you a report of the remaining ink levels . This is a big help ! I have found that the black empties very quickly . I have since bought the double pack of it to have on hand . The color ink has lasted me about 1 to 1 1/2 months . All of the INK JETS DRINK INK ! This is is only negative thing I can say , but as I said , ALL INK JETS DRING INK ! But for the money , I do love this printer !  
2	  Very easy installation . Could have been four stars for the power button not working reliably and the drive was becoming mysteriously unavailable in it 's first weeks of use . Not an issue any more .. may very well have been malicious content on my drive that has since been ushered out . All is working now . All photos videos music and lesser used files run from it , what a relief to clear up all that space !  
2	  It 's really a great camera with all the features required for the people like me . The price also too good .  
2	  I bought these for our van , so that my wife and I didn't have to listen to Disney princess movies over and over again on long trips . Honestly , for $ 20 , I wasn't expecting very much . However , I have been pleasantly surprised ! My kids are not gentle with their stuff . They like to throw things . These headphones have stood op to the daily abuses of my children ! I would buy these again .  
1	  On the plus side , the sound is good . The documentation is the worst I have ever seen : it doesn't even cover the menus and icons that appear in the product 's screen . The web site is no better at basic information , and stingy on any other details . After much experimentation and digging through online help , sparse web info , and other user 's blogs , I discovered that the device plays tracks in alphabetical order only . Creating playlists does not help . You must rename the track files according to the order you want , and create a folder on the device for each playlist or album . The software helps somewhat by renaming files with the track number as a prefix , but this prevents intermixing tracks from different albums in any playlist . Then forget about changing the order later , unless you want to manually rename each track file . A tree of folders can be created on the device using the software , but nothing in the player 's interface supports this type of access . An A to the sound engineers , C to the interface designers , D to the webmaster , and F to the documentation writers .  
2	  I bought this for my 10 year old daughter and she loves it . We were able to easily load music from our computer , we used Windows Explorer and Realplayer .. both worked well . The FM tuner is a real plus and being able to put pics on the player is fun . My daughter already has her favorites loaded . As an entry level mp3 it 's great . I 'm not real thrilled with the USB charging , but again for a beginner it will be fine . The controls are a little small for my hands but perfect for my daughter . We ended up buying headphones , the earbuds were hurting her ears .  
2	  Printer + Copy + Scanner Canon MF3240 is a simple machine to use . I bought it for home use , works perfectly with my laptop , I do not have to worry about how many pages the printing job is , since the printer is a monochrome cartridge laser which lower the cost of printing at home . I am satisfied with the multifuction futures , and its simplicity to use , I do not use all at the same time but I have it for any project afterthe office or weekends . The printer 's size was a little bigger than I expected but overall it is a good value purchase .  
1	  1 . This frequently dooesn't work on a cloudy day or near an airport2 . I live in NY and my work in Manhattan . But This only works normal only in 1/3 area in manhattan even with gps antena I bought seperatively ( 20dollor ) . 3 . It comes with 128 m memory card . But It can not have the minimal size of Map ; Map for one state . So I had to buy 1 Mb SD card ( 40 dollor ) 4 . It responds too late on a highway that I had to wait or go wrong way . 5 . Whenever I go long journey , I have to change Map with my Laptop notebook . 6 . Finaly I had to buy another one ( c530 ) . Unfortunately total price for c320 . gps anttena and meory card was almost same as sigle c 530.7 . Never buy this one please .  
2	  Just chiming in with my two cents-I bought two spindles of these and have used over half of one with no problems whatsoever . I have an HP with a built-in Lightscribe DVD writer and have used Nero , Sonic , and various other software . I 'd also like to state that they arrived in perfect condition . I 've seen some reviews that complained about discs arriving poorly packaged and cracked , but that wasn't the case with these .  
1	  Harmony 550-This item is a nightmare . I can't view a VHS tape after taping it . I bought 2 of these remotes and paid the GeekSquad at Best Buy $ 500 to program it . My husband I can't do anything we did before . I 'm not even 70 yrs . old and have a master 's degree . I 'm sure this site will never aire my complaint .  
2	  All I did was plug it in , reboot my computer for good measure and it just worked . I now have 4 computers , two switches and one wireless router . I was using the wireless router to connect everything in the living room to everything in the back room ( on the switch ) , but now the two rooms are connected directly switch to switch and everything does seem faster now . I did not check timings . I purchased this because the plugs on the wireless router were loose and the cords kept coming loose every time I futz behind the computer , plus I did not have enough jacks anyway , I was always having to unplug 1 cord to plug in the BluRay player for updates . Now with 8 ports , I am good to go .  
2	  This is going to be a fast and simple review . These speaker stands are meant for medium size speakersI use them for my KRK Rokit 5s and they fit perfectlyThey are not for oversize speakers or dj speakersMy estimate would be no more than 30 poundsThe stands have a great shape in the bottom reinforcing the stance making it difficult to tip overThe base at the top is very big ! Overall a great product for Medium size speakersVery durable and sturdyThe stands do not tilt and the previous stands that i had did $U$ MY OLD STANDS IN THIS LINK  
1	  These are discs made by CMC ( CMC MAG M01 ) for TDK . They do not support 16X write speed . They are 12X write maximum . If you want 12X discs , you can get them cheaper than this . If you want 16X , then don't buy these . These are not labelled correctly and should not be sold as 16X discs .  
1	  I wasted so much time on my Muvo that I didn't want to spend any more time thinking about that blasted thing . But I have gotten so much from other people 's reviews on Amazon that I figure I should donate my 2 cents worth . It was good in the ways that have been listed in other reviews . But then the on / off button stopped working . You can't reset the player or upgrade the firmware or anything if that happens . This is a common problem ; Google it if you doubt me . It works as a flash drive , FWIW . But I could have bought one much cheaper , and not been disappointed when I lost all the other functionality . The functions I wanted in the first place . Needless to say , Creative doesn't care in the least . They pretty much expect you to throw these away after 6 months . Good for their business , but I 'll never buy another Creative product again . Used to be a fan , but that was before they .. oh who cares ? Just don't buy anything from Creative unless you buy an insurance policy as well . And factor that into the cost of the unit .  
2	  When I ordered my new stereo head unit for my car , I wanted to make the installation process easy . Being color blind , the last thing I wanted was to hassle over what color the wires were , trying to figure it out without someone 's help . This plug make it very simple . Once I received my head-unit , I was able to sit in my living-room and correct the wires from the head-unit plug to the wires that connect into the cars harness . I made good solid connections that won't short out on anything or come apart . Once I installed the head-unit and new speakers into my car , I reconnected my battery and turned on my new stereo . It worked perfectly , no problems what so ever . This plug fit perfect and the wires matched exactly in my Mitsubishi .  
2	  This cable is fabulous ! I like the design of the cable . It is flexible and it works great . I use this one to connect my Western Digital External 1 TB Drive to my lap top . It works like an internal drive . This really helps me in editing video . So , I highly recommend this to anyone who needs to use a hard drive and want it to be as fast and efficient as the internal drive .  
1	  I have owned a mini for about a month . It hangs up and must be rebooted . The sound quality is poor . If you use it for Audio books , it is impossible to go to the correct part of the book where you stopped . I would urge anyone to go to apples own discussion board to see the numerous technical complaints . Buyer Beware .

2	  While this kit made the installation of an aftermarket radio very easy , there was a fair amount of difficulty in securing the DIN cage . The clips for my application mounted securely to the kit and are more than enough to secure the whole thing into the dash , but the DIN cage was difficult to secure to the kit . The tabs on the top of the radio 's DIN cage were easy to bend into place , but the jewel case pocket prevented the tabs from securing the bottom . I was finally able to create shims to place between the pocket and the cage , which virtually eliminated the looseness in the installation . Overall , the result is a look that is not as obscenely " aftermarket " as other radio installs I have seen . It places the front of the radio even with the surrounding dash panels , and in my opinion makes the aftermarket install blend into the dash better than the factory deck did . My shims bowed the top of the jewel case pocket a little , but it isn't too noticeable . In summary , the kit looks good , and holds my radio very securely , although it took a slight bit of fabrication to make it fit as secure as it does .  
2	  The Quality of workmanship and finish is first rate . The mechanism is smooth as silk . Very satisfied with the results , and think that the price to satisfaction ratio could not be better .  
1	  I bought this DVD / VCR combo from Best Buy about 13 weeks ago . The DVD player worked fairly well until the screen froze while watching The Ring . I could not get the unit to stop , play OR eject . I tried this several times with the remote and buttons on the unit over a few day period with no luck . Best Buy didn't want anything to do with it since it was over the 30 day return / exchange period . Sony now wants to charge me $ 29.95 to exchange it for a refurbished unit or $ 59 for fixing and returning my unit . So in summary , I spent $ 159 for the new unit , $ 29.95 for a refurbished unit and the associated shipping charges . Let 's hope that Sony can get it right the second time around . I would not recommend ANYONE buy SLVD350P from Sony .  
1	  This radio has a nice design making it pleasing to the eye , and it does have a good sound . I also found the green backlit display comforting at first . However , it is difficult to see the numbers at night unless able to look level with the clock . As I have it set up on a stand and need to look slightly up to see it , the numbers appear fuzzy . I also found the lack of a battery backup disturbing , along with the fact that it is not mentioned . It 's an okay clock radio but not one I would spend the money on again .  
2	  These are perfect . They sound awesome , have great bass , and fit in my ears very well ( my ears are on the small side , might not be as good if you have Obama ears ) . I had a pair that I bought 3 years ago that I loved but the cat got to them , so I bought a replacement pair + 2 back-ups so I won't be without these if they stop making them . Buy them .  
2	  While you won't find a lot of the top of the line features you 'll find in more expensive players , the playback is good and the on-screen menus are intuitive . The lack of S-Video out and 5.1 out means you 'll have to upgrade if you want better picture or enter the world of surround sound , but if you want a barebones DVD player for watching DVD 's , or a cheap 2nd player for the kids or bedroom , this one will do the trick .  
1	  I used a plantronics headset at work similar to this and wore it all day with no discomfort , so when it came time to need something for home I felt comfortable buying this product . The 1st one I got didn't work , I spent time on the phone with they 're tech support and was told that I must have a bad one and to return it for another . I waited for unit # 2 and when I had it set up I encountered a different problem with that unit . I called their tech support again and again they came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with the unit . I went back to my old bulky headset for the time being . 2 different units2 different problems2 returns0 satisfactionthe only good part of the whole thing was dealing with Amazon ! They made the whole experience of returning , replacement and refund bearable and problem free .  
1	  Does not appear to have a 2-channel stereo line input . Not usable with software defined radio . Very little technical documentation .  
1	  I purchased this battery in February 2009 . It works well at the beginning . After slightly more than one year of usage , its life starts to decay exponentially . Even after I ran the ThinkVantage battery maintenance program several times , its life still decays at a speed that you cannot control . Right now after full charge , it goes from 100 % to 87 % in about 15 minutes , and suddenly drops to 3 % so that the laptop is forced to shut down . The battery for my previous IBM thinkpad X21 did not decay like this . Right now I 'll have a second thought about if I would really like to purchase a brand new one , especially when the price of this product increased by ~ 10 % since last year . Quite disappointed about Lenovo .  
1	  I really don't understand how anyone could possibly think that this is a good design . I considered buying this backpack and a similar one by Jeep , but quickly realized that it was guaranteed to break almost anything you could possibly carry in it other than clothing because of the single center bar . To demonstrate the problem , put a pencil against the corner of your kitchen counter . Press on both ends of the pencil . What happens ? The pencil breaks . The kitchen counter is acting as a fulcrum , the pencil as a lever with substantial force on both ends . In a similar fashion , when you put a book in this sort of backpack , everything else in the bag is pushing on both sides of that book , but the book is supported only in the center by that single vertical post . Unless you only carry light stuff in the bag , you 're almost guaranteed to end up with bent notebooks , books with broken backs , laptops with cracked screens , and so on . It 's quite possibly the worst backpack design mistake in the history of backpacks . If you don't care about the stuff you 're carrying , by all means , buy one of these . If what you are carrying has any value at all , do yourself a favor and buy something with a more traditional double handle or wait for the designers to come up with a single handle built into a solid back so that it doesn't turn your cargo into a lever with a heavy weight at both ends . There 's not enough crack in the world for this design to make sense .  
2	  Having been a user of Cross writing implements for a number of years I had no doubt this pen would live up to my expectations . And it did .  
1	  I have had nothing but problems with my Epson 740 . The printing quality is lousy , it frequently crashes my computer and support stinks . Don't waste your money .  
1	  Poor reliability . Poor interface and menu design . Poor button action . Poor documentation . VERY poor support . I don't normally write reviews on any product , but this one has disappointed me so terribly ( not even in comparison to my Creative Lab Jukebox or my Apple iPod ) , that I wanted all to know to avoid this " player " like the plague .  
2	  If you accidentally order a Serial ATA hard drive when you meant to order an IDE hard drive , this card will let you use your Serial ATA drive in an IDE connector . This is probably a more expensive solution than returning the Serial ATA drive and paying shipping and a restocking fee , but it 's cheaper than upgrading your motherboard to one with a Serial ATA connector , plus someday you might have a system with Serial ATA built-in and get to use the hard disk you bought by mistake for its intended purpose . I was disappointed that this card does not expose both a Serial ATA and an IDE connector - once you plug this in you lose the use of the IDE connector . For some reason I thought this card had an IDE passthrough , but I was wrong .  
2	  This product was as expected and worked fine with our SD630 . A bonus included was an adaptor for car use .  
2	  I purchased this TV as an after Christmas present . So far I have been pleased with the overall performance , picture , etc . of the TV . The on board HDTV tuner works great with a UHF antenna mounted in my attic , and the overall performance of the HD features are pleasing . Exceptions to the good experience are : 1 ) 1080p - not really a 1080p TV , but advertised as such . 2 ) MP3 Player - this is a great idea that they just didn't finish . When connected on your home network , the TV will go and find MP3 's at a specified location . The problem is that the application will only find a maximum of 15 folders of MP3s at the specified location . This means that if you organize your MP3s into folders and have more than 15 of them , you 're not going to be able to play them using this feature . I 've contacted Toshiba customer service about this and been given the brush-off . I 'd also expect this to be dealt with in a firmware upgrade . BTW - the firmware upgrade will work by downloading the firmware files on the web to a machine on your home network . The TV can then be pointed to the location and load the files . Overall I 'm pleased - it would be nice to see these couple of issues fixed .  
2	  Bought this for my Grand Daughter for Christmas - Great product at a good price . We 've had an aluminum model for over 30yrs & I expect she 'll have this one at least that long .  
1	  This item was ordered in April . My American Express account has been charged for the full price of the item . As of May 31 , it has not been received . This is very bad service  
2	  was very fast and i was back in order within a few hours of receiving thebattery . very smooth transaction , and arrived much faster than i thought . thanks  
2	  This is a very nice and protective case . Access to your phone is quick and easy and that also is its negative point . The case is so easy to open that you could accidently open the case and have your phone fall out . The door opens down and out so that your phone face is exposed for easy viewing for a phone call or what ever . I 'd give it a five star if there was a way to lock the case so it could easily open unexpectantly .  
2	  I 've had this printer for just under a month now and have to say that it 's just wonderful ! After my HP stopped working ( it was about 10 years old ) , I was in search of a new printer that was affordable , but still high quality . I found it in my i860 ! This printer is almost perfect . It 's fast ( 23 ppm , even though I never printed that much ) , quiet , and the pictures it prints are gorgeous ! Everyone I showed them to couldn't tell the difference from a real picture . The ink tanks are reasonable , and you only throw away the ones that are empty - saving more money in the long run . Using the ' sample ' cartridges that came with the printer , I 've printed at least 15 4x6 " pictures , and 2 8x10 " , as well as at least half a dozen CD labels ( full color , not just writing on white ) , and a few documents .. AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T RUN OUT ! The reason I said almost perfect is because of 2 downsides : # 1 - you have to buy a USB cable separately . Given , you can pick one up for $ 6 or less , but that 's like buying a kid a toy for his birthday and not getting the batteries - it 's useless . I found out that after I bought the USB cable that it does work with a parallel port , which I happened to already have . I used the USB anyway . # 2 - Like many other reviewers said , Canon paper is a must for photos ! Trust me , it doesn't look any different from other paper , but it is . Pictures I printed on HP paper came out grainy . It was almost as bad as printing on my 600 dpi HP . I followed the same picture up with Canon paper , and as I said earlier , no one knew it wasn't a photo . The paper is reasonable , only $ 7.00 for 50 sheets ( This is a sale , so it might go up ) . If it wasn't for those 2 things , this would be a 5-star . I almost rated it 5 anyway . If you buy this printer , you will not be disappointed .  
1	  Mistake # 1 I originally bought the combo so I could sync my pda since it 's a bluetooth device , but MS doesn't include the required bluetooth profiles . Mistake # 2 Even though the keyboard and mouse have great designs , the MS Bluetooth transceiver can not function properly with any other Bluetooth transceiver on the computer system . So buying a Bluetooth USB adapter from another company and installing it will not work ( its either the Microsoft transceiver or a competing company or neither - However , bluetooth profiles for the keyboard / mouse combo are not included with competing companies bluetooth usb adapters ) . Too make a long story short , at this time , a decision to have a bluetooth wireless keyboard / mouse combo or a different bluetooth usb adapter to allow syncing of pdas and other devices must be made . YOU CAN NOT HAVE BOTH . While installing both devices will work initially , eventually the wireless connection will be lost and more time will be spent unstalling and reinstalling the combo than actually using it .

1	  We use dual monitors for office work so we purchased around 10 units of SyncMaster 941bw one or two years ago . Start from two weeks ago one of mine burned out . Last week another one went out . This morning the third one went out . Now we are looking at the rest of the monitors and considering the next one will be out at any time . Very poor quality for a monitor that only has less than two year of life .  
2	  I don't think it is possible to find a better multimedia speaker deal for under $ 40.00 . The speakers set up easily and , despite their looks , can stay fairly inconspicuous . I have mine set up on top of our armoir withsome decorative plants to hide the sub . I am using this with the excellent AirPort Express to pipe my iTunes collection into the living room .  
2	  I like it though because it may come in useful . I got the 9V clip with it ( paid separate ) it should be included . There are others with a switch which may be more useful . I got it to enegize my fuel injector but found later that 12volts won't hurt injectors .  
1	  I had an old 75 ohm ' ? adapter that has 2 screws for wires ( antennas ) and 1 coax to hook to the TV . It works better than this HDTV Powered Antenna . Seriously , I can unplug the power and there isn't a noticable difference . You 'd almost be better off sticking an unbent paperclip in your coax jack and call it good ( Yes that works if you 're TV isn't against a metal wall ) . Wm  
1	  i really needed a scrapbook , and got this miniscule , more-photo-album than a scrapbook . maybe i don't know sizes but i didn't think 8 by 8 would be so small . it 's the size of a normal sized plate . but in a square shape of course . and the paper is not some fantastic paper . its the ones you use when doing a presentation for a project . that hard paper . i don't know , i just suspected it would be high quality , glossy paper . this scrapbook with the paper made me think , " looks like i could have put this together . " if i wanted / expected something as tiny as this then i would be giving it 5 stars and say it is cute . of course i 'd be expecting it to cost much less too . but i have lots of normal sized pics / clippings ( from mags e . t . c ) and this is no use to me . there 's no way my pics can fit in this . bottom line , for so much $ i expected more . i 've learned my lesson to go in a shop to buy these kinds of stuff . b / c you can't tell what you 're purchasing when it 's on line .  
1	  I purchased this product and when received discovered it was not for a 64 bit system . I tried to return it within two weeks maybe three because I didn't try to use it right away and got no answer to my emails . There 's no phone number to call . A real crappy way to do business . I am now stuck with a product I cannot use . I use to like buying from Amazon . Do what you want to but I got screwed ! Swann PC DVR 4 Net  
2	  This is a great product and gets unbelievable reception . I use it in the shower , outside at the grill and just about everywhere . Well worth the price .  
2	  Wow .. this is all I can think .. i was expecting that after paying just $ 4 for this , that it would be some cheap thing that would break after a few uses .. but it has been working for a while now , and i love it ! It is nto exactly the best quality , but it plays my music fir a whole bunch of my friends on the go ..  
2	  Been using it for awhile with an Athlon XP and Radeon 9800 Pro , both overclocked a respectable amount . Idle temps are about 13C above ambient , and load temps climb up to 20C.The unit ships with heavy duty 1/4 " lines , which might cause problems hooking up to some waterblocks . The waterblock it ships with is pretty decent ( low pressure drop ) , but it 's lucite , so you have to be careful not to overtighten the barbs . The pump isn't anything special . 1.8m pressure head , 500lph . Trying to run northbridge , CPU , and GPU blocks is probably too much for it unless you specifically get low-pressure-drop block designs . Filling it is a bit tricky , since the reservoir sits down inside the casing a little bit . You 'll likely want a small funnel with 1-2 " nozzle on it . The bottle it ships with has a small nozzle on it , but without pinpoint precision , it 'll be all over the place . Coolermaster would have been better off shipping with a funnel . The unit has it 's own AC power board and cord , which ties into the power supply 's line . However , the unit is dependent on the 12v line of your PSU as a signal to turn on . This means you have to completely prime your hoses and waterblocks with water , before turning the computer on . It really needs some kind of override jumper to allow functionality without being tied to the computer 's on / off switch . You could also pull the mainboard 's power cord off , and ground out the " AT-OK " wire ( or use a power-supply tester ) , which would turn on the pump without turning on your computer . The fan has three settings , and is a high-performance 80mm fan . The fastest setting sounds like any Delta or similar fan . The middle setting is reasonable , the lowest setting is nearly inaudible . You can customize the shutdown temperatures ( for the probe and tank-water , seperately ) and delay . The unit ships with an electronic temperature sensor , with about 14 " of cord . It 's an easy , compact beginner-cooler .  
2	  I bought this for myself after our son , who is in college told me about the one he 'd purchased . I liked his , but it was WAY too small for my older eyes ! I did some research , and found this one . It 's fantastic . If you are looking to purchase an MP3 player , be careful , because not all of them are expandable . This particular little gadget is perfect for all my needs . No more skipping , like you have with a CD player ! It 's easy to work , and sounds fantastic . I have no regrets about buying the Rio Cali .  
1	  I loved this Cordless headset until I found another that was under fifty bucks which was just as good . ( R * dio S * k )  
2	  I 'm on the shorter side and although me feet touch the floor , I find myself propping them on my trash can under my desk , on top of my computer tower , or bending them back to rest on the feet of my chair . Just a few days with this underfoot and I 've noticed my legs don't ache as badly . Very comfortable ! I could lower my chair , but then my arms are uncomfortable at my keyboard . This allows me to even stretch my legs and rest them comfortably without having to slouch in my chair to find a comfortable spot for my legs . I sit straighter now because I 'm not straining to move my legs to the next position .  
1	  Microtek has a genuine professional pedigree ; for years I saw Microtek scanners at the newspapers I worked for . And the 4900 has the apprearance of being a professional model , with sophisticated adjustments for tweaking color , etc . It also has some great features for amateurs , such as seven buttons on the scanner that can be customized , so that you could , for example , scan the same photo at 100 dpi , 300 dpi , 600 dpi , 48-bit , 24-bit , tif and jpeg , all without fiddling with the computer . But the instructions are not written for amateurs , and many features are not clearly explained . The program seems to default to allowing multiple frames , with the result that I got several crop lines on the preview screen I could not get rid of , and multiple images each time I scanned . But don't try looking up " crop " or " auto crop " in the help section - they aren't there . I tried to find out more on the Microtek web site , but it was down . Earth to Microtek : Look at each of your screens and each of the functions on each screen and write instructions for how to use them for your help section , not just a one-sentence label of what they are . The bottom line is quality , and the images are not up to par for professionals . I tried using the film adapter and found it worthless , unable to produce sharp images . But what is worse , I discovered that there was heavy horizontal and vertical streaking . At the maximum optical resolution of 2,400 dpi the vertical streaking was about six pixels wide , and was obvious even on the small preview image . This streaking was typically down to about two pixels wide at 1,200 dpi , and was still visable at 600 dpi . When I switched to a grayscale scan it was even more obvious , meaning the light sensitivity of the CCD sensors was inconsistent . There was also horizontal streaking , though less obvious . When I switch to scanning an opaque subject , the streaking was not quite as obtrusive , but still obvious if you knew what to look for . Since the streaking is visable at 600 dpi , this means the useable resolution of this 2,400 dpi optical scanner is only 300 dpi . At this rate , the images are not even up to par for amateurs . The color of the scans was good , but I would not call it professional . And it did not seem to me to be exceptionally sharp . Scans are fast , but the scanner is slow to respond , so total time is not so good . Loading the driver after clicking on the icon is agonizingly slow on my 566 mhz Celeron , and there is no " wait " icon . The OCR program is the worst I have ever tried to use , and I 've owned three other scanners . This may be the right scanner for some people . Basic functions are easy to use - if the scanner does not default to some cryptic mode . But anything more will take several days of experimentation to learn , unless you are a professional . I 'm not , and this scanner is going back .  
1	  The rate for this product should be - 10 . I bought this external hard drive in 2004 , saved a couple of files , and used it sporadically ( I have other hard drives .. different brand though ) . After 1 and a half year the product started failing ( bad sectors ) , and after 2 years I got more bad sectors . I can't even format the disk . The warranty of this product is 1 year , and the only advice of their customer service is to buy a new one . They told me that to repair the product would cost more than buying a new one . Now it 's a piece of junk in my room .  
2	  This is the first mp3 player I own . It is wonderful so far . The software is easy to download , and easy to manage . The player is small , light , and has tons of space . I have loaded about 200 songs , and it 's not even half full . I haven't done anything with the playlist yet . It looks like you 'll have to create the playlist on the computer instead of on the player itself . But it looks pretty straight forward . Sound quality is very good . I was a little skeptical about the tiny joy stick . But it has proven very handy and easy to use . I really enjoy this little player . Too bad no holder comes with it .  
1	  How many reviewers do you think were influenced by the success - and excellence - of Tartt 's first novel ? If the public was smart enough to pick out her first novel - and be right - might they not be correct about this one as well ? The first dozen of so pages were great , but the author just got too enchanted with her own word processor .  
2	  $U$ keep the price under $ 300 Apple deleted the AC adaptor that was included with previous iPODS . You only get the USB charging cable . Remember too that not all USB ports have power on some computers . So if you ever want to travel or don't want to keep your iPOD charging on your desk all day or in an internet cafe , you need the AC adaptor that just plugs into the wall to charge . There may be ones that work that aren't apple brand I 'm not sure .. but you need one , trust me .  
1	  As others have stated the needles were not shipped . When we tried to contact the seller therew as no response .  
1	  This was a good unit for the first year after we bought it . I used it as a printer , scanner AND copier , and did quite nicely . But as soon as the warranty expired , the heads on the color cartridges clogged up and no amount of cleaning them could fix the problem . I spent quite a bit of money on all new cartridges , thinking that this might help . Nope . I just hate it when equipment implodes when the clock ticks one minute past warranty . The Epson people were helpful when I called them , but I still have to buy a new printer .  
2	  We love this camera . It is very easy to use and is especially easy to download and burn onto DVDs . This makes sharing very easy . We bought this one because of the f1.2 lens which lets in more light . It is still somewhat lacking when it comes to indoors but it is definitely better than the other JVC cameras without the f1.2 lens .  
2	  it 's good . and protects my lens . but it will be nicer if it 's muti coated . but then again . no complain for the price .  
2	  it 's good . and protects my lens . but it will be nicer if it 's muti coated . but then again . no complain for the price .  
1	  Mine worked great for a little over a month , but the on / off switch had intermittent problems , and the unit finally would only stay on for 30 minutes or so . Warranty period of course is lapsed . Don't waste your money on this one .  
2	  I purchased a 100 inch with 4:3 aspect ratio for presenting a professional course in a rented hotel room that had an 8 foot ceiling . The screen was manageble ( despite its length ) . The setup was easy ( leveraging off of grade school familiarity with projector screens ) . The aspect ratio and size did a fine job in reflecting the output of a video projector with normal room lighting . I saved the purchase price easily rather than having the hotel 's audio / visual contractor provide the equipment . I am very pleased with the equipment and savings .  
1	  I purchased this unit from Frys electronics in the Portland OR area , in April of 2007 . the first one I bought first day the sound was not working and it was an obvious lemon . I promptly returned it and should have purchased an extended Warrantee on the replacement but I didnt . the replacement seemed to work ok for a while , but then occasionally the sound ( DVD ONLY ) would drop out to low levels and then back to normal , and sometimes would have horrible static in the sound . then it was fine for a while . then back to the issue . I took it back to Frys , and they would NOT exchange it , only send it in for repair , at first they said the Warrantee was 90 days but the papers said 1 year . after 40 days it was back after being " adjusted " and it seemed to work fine for a month or so . Now the DVD volume plays at about 1/10th of where it should be , very low , and has not come back . Taking it back for service again . Our old sony player only still works fine and has for 9 years or so . go figure , wondering if they tried to pack too m much into one package ? since I saw 2 personally that were BAD id stay away from this model but it may be just me .  
1	  This may be a good radio . It should not be listed in the HD Radio section . It is not .  
1	  Like some other people , I recieved my computer and was extremely excited , because this time , I actually paid for mine instead of my parents . I turned it on , connected my external hard drive , and started to play music . BAM ! Screen went black , music turned off , and the only way I could continue was to hit the power off button , then power it back up . This is completely unacceptable , and I have no earthly idea why Toshiba hasn't issued a recall . I wouldn't have felt compelled to write a review here on Amazon , but I took my computer back , and got another one . The same GODD * MN thing happened the day I got it ! I am stunned , sitting here with a non-working computer , thanking the sweet lord for the fact that I kept my reciept . I would go with another computer , and dont even waste your time hoping to get one that works . Other than that , its an ok machine .  
1	  For being a cheap ( er ) spotting scope , it would be ok other than at higher power settings ( 50-60x ) it 's like putting in your contacts . If the manufacturer would incorporate a glaucoma detector on the lenses , you could regularly have a checkup while viewing using higher power settings since you HAVE to all but put your eyeball on the lens to see anything larger than a pinhole . Hence the " what eye relief " comment . The tripod included is fine for the price . The case is nice for the price . Cheaply made of course but usable . A good Pelican case will be at least 1/2 the price of this scope . Returning to replace with Binoculars with tripod mount .. should be much better solution for 50 % more cost . This is first Barska product and doubtful will buy more . Should have just stuck with Nikon products that I already own and know their specs are accurate to make good buying decisions with .  
2	  This item had a good price and was very easy to install . So far I have had no problems .  
1	  I bought this to replace the DVD player my kids use in the car . They watched a movie at home and it worked great . We were ALL excited it had two sets of headphones . They used it in the car to watch one movie and it worked fine . Then they went to watch another movie and it stopped playing about 10 minutes into the movie . The screen just froze and nothing would work . We changed DVDs and it gave an error message of " Wrong disc " . We tried disc after disc and it never worked again . I was going to get the same player again , b / c I really liked it , but upone further reflection , I think I won't buy this one again .  
1	  I waited 3 weeks for this printer cartridge to come in . It apparently got lost in the mail somewhere in the western part of the country . But Amazon made good and refunded my money promptly when I sent them an e-mail explaining what happened . FYI - Be sure you keep up with any order numbers you get if you order anything from anywhere .  
1	  We purchased this portable unit for our travel trailer . But couldn't get it to work with our tv . We were very disappointed with the directions sent with this unit . Not very helpful . We ended up sending the satellite back to the company .  
1	  If you do much printing you will find that this ink is very , very expensive . In the past I 've always kept to the HP ink products . But I 'll look for alternatives now that the price of this ink has gotten out of hand .  
1	  After following startup directions exactly , charging for the requisite 6 hours , using the Creative software installed on my computer , my 4GB Creative Zen Plus froze repeatedly during playback . Today , when trying to shut it down , the entire device froze . Tried to restart it , followed the steps to reset it .. no luck . Now , I can't even get it to turn back on and there was power left in the battery . Am returning to Amazon with regret and will look for a different kind of player . Also , a note to other potential buyers , the black player ends up getting fingerprints all over it and looking generally greasy from the oils or lotion on your hand .  
1	  On the fourth day of owning this TV , the lamp went out completely ! After talking to consumer relations , we found out that even though they will send you a replacement lamp , you ( the customer ) is responsible for replacing the lamp ; they do not send out their service people to do it even while under warranty . Furthermore , after calling in to open a case , they give you a confirmation number and you have to write this number on your receipt ( proof of purchase ) and fax it to them before they will send the part out . What a HASSLE , not to mention the poor quality of the TV 's lamp to go out on the FOURTH day of ownership .  
1	  I 've had mine for about 2 weeks now . At first glance its a great product . The ipod has simple controls and a very intuitive interface . Works great in the car or at the gym . However , as you get past all the design eye-candy , you 'll soon realize that Apple was in too much of a rush and sent a whole bunch of first batch lemons . I 've already been through TWO ipod mini 's because of a technical glitch . For some reason , they seem to freeze up whileusing the controls . Here 's the funny part .. you can't do anything to refresh it since the battery is internal and you cant take it out . Even holding down the play button for 6 seconds doesn't power off the ipod . I 've upgraded the firmware and it still freezes up . The only thing to do is wait till the battery dies completely , and then you can restart ( reboot ) it . Sorry Apple , but that 's a stupid design flaw . When it freezes , which is very often , sometimes you have to wait up to 8hrs for the battery to drain before restarting it . I am returning this paper weight and getting my money back . I 'll wait a couple more months so Apple can get their act together and deliver a more polished product . You shouldn't rush a great product Apple , because in the end , you 'll just have unhappy consumers .  
2	  I bought one of these along with three MSI PC60G ( Ralink 61 ) . Right now I 'm using it with the tomato firmware , but even the standard one was fine . One of the clients is in a room outside the house ( there are two thick walls and a kitchen between the router and the PC ) , another is directly upstairs ( again , an old , thick floor ) and the third is still waiting for the assembly . The signal is surprisingly good ( even with the linksys firmware , but better with tomato set to 42mW ) , though I had to keep trying channels until I found one that didn't suffer from intermitent noise outside the house ( probably coming from a neighbor using a 2.4GHz telephone ) . The QOS with tomato is great , too . The router keeps cool even here in Rio de Janeiro !  
2	  Pro : Very crisp , clear sound . Nice design . Con : Power / volume knob is a little stiff to turn .  
2	  There are a few of us who like to use old technology for its own sake . Maybe its the challenge of ' massaging ' old technology to try to get state of the art results out of obsolete equipment , maybe it is nostalgia for some . For me , it was a combination of wanting to save a few bucks while getting the best possible image quality . Several years ago I bought a very-used KodaK / Nikon DCS330 digital camera to wrap around several IX-Nikkor APS lenses I own . My how things have changed since this camera first appeared in 1997 ! The size is large , very large , even though the camera body Kodak used as a base is the ' smaller ' Nikon Pronea 6i , which was an APS ( remember that failed format ? ) unit . And it is very power-hungry : I eats 6 AA batteries so quickly ( and so expensively ) that the only practical solution is an external battery pack , in my case a used Quantum Battery 2 , now discontinued , with a coiled cord tethering the two together . Why bother with all this stuff when you can get a small , faster , more-megapixelated camera ? In short , Image quality . The color rendition , depth , saturation , and sharpness of the images taken with this camera are simply outstanding . I 'm more than willing to put up with its 3.0 megapixel resolution to get what I consider to be the finest quality digital picture I 've ever seen . Its hard to explain , but the picture is ' warm , ' unlike the super-accurate and to my eyes cold rendering of most digital cameras . The DCS330 is more like film in warmness , albeit the intrusive graininess . But there are drawbacks . Size and weight of all this stuff is one , having to use an external power supply on your belt is another , and its need for this item being reviewed , a ' hot mirror , ' is a third . A hot mirror is a special filter needed in early digital cameras to block infrared light from reaching the CCD sensor . Today , this technology is either built-in or isn't needed because of technological improvements , I 'm not sure which . But the old digitals need this filter , or the image will have a reddish cast to it . The Kodak DCS330 had one built-in in front of the mirror inside the body , but it had to be removed to use IX-Nikkor APS lenses for which the Nikon body was originally designed , otherwise the lens , with its extra-deep seating within the camera body , would break the built-in hot mirror . Kodak said you can't use the IX-Nikkors ; yes you can , but the internal hot mirror must first be removed and replaced with a lens-mounted version like this Tiffen . And that 's all there is to tell . You need one of these if you are considering an older professional-grade Kodak digital with IX-Nikkor lenses , or if for any reason there is a need to replace the built-in hot mirror with a conventional lens-mounted hot mirror filter . Unless you like red-toned pictures , that is . The Tiffen does a great job , is of good quality . This part is pricey , but that may reflect the lowered demand and consequent higher cost per unit to produce . For people like me who simply enjoy playing with old , technologically-obsolete weirdo camera equipment , Tiffen 's continuing production of this and similar filters for obsolete technology is a godsend .  
1	  It seemed like a great idea . So small , more then enough room to store the images I was taking for my first digital job on my first digital camera and super cheap . I 'm not too tech smart and had a friend set it up to run with my MAC as it didn't recognize it at first . All was well until it turned over on itself . Now I know it was probably my fault . But just beware of 2 things if you are a newbie like me . The USB cord is very short and a little unstable in its connection . There is no room to wiggle if you are on a laptop . And second is they must be very sensitive right ? if you loose every single thing on it just because it turns over ! For the record it turned over I didn't drop it . Everything I had taken was lost .  
2	  Great picture out of this one , hooked up in an office with 12 TVs and had absolutely no signal issues . If you are mounting this in a server closet on a wall , you 'll want to purchase a couple of L brackets from home depot that will line up with two of the holes on the top where the two black tabs are . Measure and zip them into the wall , and then secure the splitter onto the brackets with a pair of nuts and bolts for each side .  
1	  Bought it on black friday at best buy . Used it about 10 times before it broke . Don't buy it !  
1	  This thing has given us problems from the start and of course with no help from their tech support . It 's so erratic that it won't print try after try but if you shut it off for a few days it might work after that .  
1	  My husband bought a DX6340 and was pleased with it so I bought one , too . Shortly after that the battery door on his camera broke and would not close . A few months later when I took my camera out of the camera bag I discovered my battery door was broken and would not close . I contacted Kodak for repair . They would not sell a battery door . They wanted $ 105 to fix it or they would sell me a trade in for $ 199 . My camera was only a little over a year old and mechanically fine except for the broken door . I will not buy another Kodak product .  
2	  This cord gave my television the appetence that I was actually in the scene while they were shooting the movie  
2	  Sides are perfectly flush with Corolla 's dash . Looks great . Better than any generic mounting kit I 've ever bought .  
2	  I bought this digital camera for my husband . This fit the bill . You are able to do so many different projects with this camera . This camera is enterchangeable with all his lens that he had already aquired for an automatic / manual Pentax camera . He is so pleased with this camera and everthing that it can do .  
2	  This filter protects my objective on the Canon EF-S 18-55 mm IS II zoom lens . I have used Tiffen products for over 50 years .  
1	  I bought the Clix 2 because of Consumer 's Report 's recommendation of it . After attempting to use it and windows media player , I am not sure if Consumer 's Report really tried using it . Media player is fine for playing cds and mp3s on the computer , but it did not sync easliy with the clix 2 . It would NOT download audio files . The help from WMP was not helpful . It simply walked me through the steps of downloading that the clix 2 demonstrated in its materials . The iRiver customer support is terrible . You will not speak to a live person . When calling the 800 number on the iRiver site , it is a recording that loops the suggestion of using the online help . I used the online help and it walked me reduntantly through the repetitive steps I had already performed . I does offer a feed back email , and an iRiver rep did correspond with me three days after the initial complaint . His help consisted of explaining the same redudant steps I had already performed . He did provide follow up emails , but it never really answered my questions - just the same redundant steps . I am not sure if the previous emails regarding the problem were reviewed although it was the same customer service rep . I returned the clix 2 last week and bought an ipod nano 4G . The ipod works perfectly . It downloads audio files . It is simple to use iTunes . Its only draw back is that it has no FM tuner which is the only feature that was better in the clix2 .  
2	  Like many others have said , the sound is just great . But the default base out of these speakers is just way too much . I 'm all for bass don't get me wrong . I won't buy speakers that doesn't have a lot of bass but the problem is there is no control nob for bass or treble . The main problem is that the bass is so powerful , it just totally overpowers the sound quality because you 're hearing way too much base where it would be better to have a good balance of bass and treble together . If there were some control over those two here , these speakers would stand through time as being very good even after 5-10 years from now . So I wouldn't recommend it just because of the lack of control of the both powerful bass and treble that these speakers generate .  
1	  The Toshiba SD-4990 DVD player is junk ! It constantly ' freezes ' while playing back any type DVD . It randomly locks up for 3-12 seconds . I 've tried resetting as described below , but that only worked for a few disks then unit started freezing again . Interestingly , there is little or no pause during layer changes . Toshiba tech support offered no help at all , telling me all my disks must be bad ! Avoid this player !  
1	  This is a total waste of money and engineering . Plenty of free frequencies in my area and it would barely connect to anything . Sound quality horrible even when the device is right next to the antenna on a portable FM player . Wrapping it back up and sending it back .  
2	  I 've owned one of these for about 4 years now and just had to replace it because it wore out . 4 years of near daily use impressed me so I purchased one again . If you need an adaptor , this is a good one to get .  
2	  Work just as I hoped they would . Require some work to install but they look great and do the job well .  
2	  The " Barska Binocular Tripod Adaptor " is surprising sturdy and well made , especially for the low price I paid here at Amazon . We needed a second tripod adaptor for ourCelestron SkyMaster Giant 15x70 Binoculars w / Tripod Adapter . These binoculars actually come with a fairly good tripod adaptor , but we wanted to leave that one on our monopod and this one on a tripod . The quality of this Barska adaptor is better than the Celestron , in my opinion . Highly recommended !  
1	  My son got it and he was so happy . Well it didn't even last a weak . The wires at the plug came apart . I had never had this happen w / any type of plug . I think we got a defective cord . My son takes great care for his stuff because he buy 's everything . When this happened he didn't know what to say or think about it . If you have a Play Station 2 cord that will work better then this cord , so try and save your money .  
1	  This is a nice looking compact device , but that 's where the benefits end . I had this thing for about two months and it worked flawlessly until it died . I unplugged , replugged , unplugged yet again and nothin ' . The modem to which it was attached was also powercycled and when connected directly to a PC it worked fine . Not only was the wireless portion dead but the wired connections were dead as well . The useless Netgear just sat there with some of its LEDs running except for the one with the everything's-OK-checkmark . I tried contacting Netgear 's tech support department but they charge $ 33 for a support call . How nice of them : release s ( * $ t that doesn't work right then charge people $ 33 for repair . Nice way to encourage people to never buy your products again . POS . Why the hell does something like this break ? It has no moving parts and is even plugged into a UPS device . Needless to say this wireless router met my concrete floor at a high rate of speed and I 'm about to go out and buy another model from a different company .  
1	  I will never buy a Linksys product again . After Cisco bought it out the quality has been bad . Had to return 2 times to get a working unit . Even then it was pretty bad . I replaced the Linksys firmware with DD-WRT . Only then would it work . Even with the DD-WRT firmware the Wireless N wouldn't work . So I had been using all my N devices as G. Used it for 5 years and it finally died . I was copying large video files over the gigabit LAN and the hardware couldn't handle it . I now have an ASUS RT-16N it works perfectly . I had to upgrade the firmware on the ASUS to the latest . Wireless N works great with the ASUS .  
1	  I purchased the EX-1011 as a great way to share photos with my family and friends . I bought two frames for my parents and my wife 's parents . After spending $ 600 ( they were more expensive in Dec08 ) Kodak is now changing their online policy - now they require a regular photo printing purchase or they will delete the photos in your gallery . Kodak , are you kidding me ? I spend $ 600 and then you try to nickle and dime me out of more money with a blanket policy . If you 're buying this for online sharing ( and why else would you pay this much for a frame ) then I 'd look elsewhere . Who knows what the next policy change will bring .  
2	  not perfect , some noise still goes through , but I always take them with me on long flights .  
2	  Since the early days of " the Plug " I have probably had about 6 or 8 pair . I use them with my ipod , for private guitar practice in my office during lunch , and for watching training videos on a portable DVD player . Are there better earbuds out there ? ABSOLUTELY ! But not for the price . These fit well , when inserted properly , keep out a lot of the extraneous noise , are perfectly comfortable and have an acceptably good quality of sound . I keep thinking I will buy a more expensive , higher quality set of earbuds , but I have been so happy with these that I just can't bring myself to spend the extra dough !  
1	  I purchased this mainly as an alarm but was happy with the multiple features it offered . I was disappointed that the volume of the morning alarm could not be set below " 10 " which was , IMHO very loud . There was a sticker added to the manual explaning that the alarm volume could not be set below ' 10 ' , but if you were just listening to the radio like during the day , you could easily adjust the volume down below ten or up . Since there was this ' sticker ' added after the fact in the usage guide , I have to believe it was a manufacturing ' oversight ' during product design .  
2	  i love it the best hdmi cable . is cable is good for a ps3 and a xbox 360 good job :)  
2	  I 've had my set for about two weeks . It replaced a 5 year old Toshiba rear projection HDTV.I watch Time Warner Cable , HD DVDs ( Toshiba HD A2 ) and Blue Ray HD DVDs ( SONY PS3 ) . I have been pleased with the picture quality of HD material on all three mediums . I find the standard definition Cable picture quality inferior to the quality of standard definition on our standard defiinition ( 480i ) TVs . Upconverting standard DVDs works well and produces a fine picture on the WD-57831 . My one complaint so far concerns the WD-57831 cooling fan . Its quite noisy . Otherwise I love the set and the price was right = $ 2400 including shipping .  
2	  This is the best Christmas present I have bought myself in a long time . I have a bunch of old 8MM video tapes and some VHW tapes from when the kids were little . I have been converting a couple a night since Christmas and this thing works great . I haven't had one DVD fail to burn . I wish I could burn pictures from a SD card to a DVD in a format that I could view on TV through a regular DVD player . SD only record to DVD-RAM disc . Still this is a great piece .  
2	  [ .. ] The HDMI Cable 2M long is a professionally molded , gold finished cable . With the very low price , I had my doubts but it works great . As another reviewer commented , digital cables pretty much work , or don't work as analog signal degeneration is not an issue . This cable works fine !  
1	  I have owned three Lanier Microcassette Recorders over the past thirty years . It was everything they advertised it to be . When I went to buy one this time they were no longer being made . They were replaced by this Sony BM-575 . It isn't half the recorder that the Lanier was . You can't record in noisy areas without picking up all the background noises . The plaback is nowhere as clear as the Lanier . If I could find a Lanier right now I would buy one and throw this Sony away .  
2	  There 's lots of analysis out there that shows brand names like Monster provide no real performance value over generics . These are a steal on Amazon . I recommend ordering several at a time so that you have them handy . These are inexpensive enough to do that without damaging your wallet .  
2	  I used to play CD 's all the time at home .. Until I bought the MP101 and signed up for Rhapsody . By using the MP 101 with Rhapsody , I have access to a massive catalog of music that I don't actually own - it 's like having the biggest jukebox in the world right in my living room . I highly recommend this product with Rhapsody .  
2	  I like this camera . It 's fairly easy to get it to stay on the laptops I 've used it with ( both HP ) , the software sets up quickly and effortlessly , the camera is small and lightweight , and the picture quality is really nice . I can't think of anything I don't like about it . I would give it a 5 , but it 's the only Webcam I 've ever used so I don't have anything to compare it to .  
2	  Worked . I have a Dell Inspiron 8600 with Linux Ubuntu Mint Edition . But could have used an indication of capacity somewhere on the thing .  
1	  I am very dissatisfied . This box has 3 separate inputs , but only a single person can use it at a time . I have multiple people on a small LAN that would like to use this system . This is a waste for the money .  
2	  It 's a great device , lot 's of memory and features . The price of 80 $ was the cat 's meow ! I like it .  
1	  This is the first MP3 player I have ever purchased ; I do not believe my expectations were too high . Here are the pros : 1 ) It is small2 ) It takes whatever SD card size you care to plug in3 ) It plays mp3 filesHere are the cons : 1 ) You can not change the order of the mp3s on the player2 ) If you copy several mp3s to it , they may appear in any order . 3 ) If you pause it , it will turn off in a short period of time4 ) It has no memory of where you last were in whatever you were playing once it turns off ( especially annoying if you are listening to an audio book with large chapters ) 5 ) The battery life is not what I expected , less than 6 hours of play .  
1	  As other people already mentioned , avoid this wireless router with the version number 4 . ( the one with the picture of only one row of leds on the packaging ) I 've been a devout user of Linksys , but this time it 's very disappointing . The problem is that this router often loses some packets . The download windows often hang and ftp connections are very unstable . Messenger loses connections as well . I don't know how Linksys came to release this kind of product into the market but it makes me sad to watch this product destroying Linksys 's brand value . I hope the problems can be settled sooner or later . I 'm going to return my router to the local retailer .  
1	  We purchased this player a couple of months ago . It worked well out of the box . The remote control was strangely laid-out with unconventional keying sequences . Soon after ( or maybe out of the box ) , part of the display started to fail , which we didn't mind . It 's continued to deteriorate since . These days , it fails to play a CD or VCD ( even the ones in great condition ) continuously for more than a minute . The remote control only works intermittenly . It 's getting a marginal 2 stars only because it still plays the last 2 DVDs we tried and that 's a generous rating only because of the low price . So , you get what you paid for and I 'd consider buying it a crapshoot considering some of the good reviews . Sure , we didn't think this player will last more than a couple of years considering the price , but we are surprised that it 's starting to fail even before we got our rebate from Malata ! By the way , the tiny display only show the elapse time of the current track . No information on the current track number or the total elapse / play time . A bit annoying when playing a CD .  
1	  I bought this with the matching pre-n card and it 's been so frustrating . Wireless connection almost completely useless since it constantly drops the connection . My wired connection sometimes stops working and then I have to reboot the router . I 've been checking tech support for a firmware upgrade / repair and nothing to be found . Reading the reviews , many people have been having these problems . I guess Belkin just feels a new sucker is born every minute . Well , this sucker is not buying anything from this company if I can help it . Another reviewer spoke well of the new Netgear Rangemax router . I 'll probably buy one of those to see if it 's better .  
2	  I assumed the radio would have a cord attached so I could plug it in . It didn't . I 'll have to hunt around for an adaptor . Other than that , it 's a good little radio .  
2	  i use these for my rear surrounds and am extremely satisfied , great bass for a small tower . worth the money  
2	  really nice product .. Using it for more than a year and the result is nice smooth skin .. easy to use ..  
1	  Very disapointed that it is not clearly stated by Amazon that this product is to be used only by Vonage ( very expensive compared to other providers like Inphonex which is now my provider ) . I bought two routers RT31P2 and two PAP2 phone adapters all with Phone ports hoping I would be able to connect all my family ( spread around the world ) . I got a Huge surprise when I noticed that they are locked only for use with Vonage . It says there is a Mail in Rebate worth 50 bucks , anyway it will only last less than two months . Other providers don't even charge monthly fees . I had already sent all the units to various countries and after finding out that they are to be used EXCLUSIVELY with Vonage I just had to let them die where they were sent . It is not worth the shipping to bring them back . As disappointing as this , was that I supposed this was going to happen so I contacted customer support from Amazon and asked them ( before buying ) if they were a " with Vonage telephony system " or if they were a " exclusively for Vonage telephony system " . They didn't know so I just assumed they wouldn't be so distracted to not mention this . Specially for starters like us it may have been the most important thing to advertise : EXCLUSIVELY FOR VONAGEI have always been a fan of Linksys products , my house is full of their products and never had trouble with the hardware . For sure I will continue to buy Linksys products , for sure I will never use vonage ( eventhough I am sure it provides excellent clear voice communication ; don't get cofussed , there are others that will give you more for a lot less go to yahoo and spend 30 seconds making a quick search and you will see ) , and for sure I had to tell other people what they are doing so nobody else will loose the money I lost , and what is most valuable , my time . Make sure that when you buy a PAP2 it says : Model PAP2-NAConclussion : I just lost 260 bucks plus shipping and handling ( internationally )  
1	  I have had so many problems with this piece of garbage . After much effort , I finally got the printer working with the 3 computers in my home ( 2 PC , 1 Mac ) . I had to change the password on my network , so I updated all the machines , including the printer . Now the Mac works , but I have not been able to get the Windows machines to recognize the printer . A couple months later , my Mac can't find the printer either ! Nothing has changed on my network in these last couple months . And I don't have time to spend another 6 hours trying to debug this thing again . It appears that HP has seriously lost their mojo in printers , which used to be their strong suit . This printer is the biggest piece of junk since the last HP printer I returned . Never again , HP . Thanks for nothing ..  
2	  used this on my canon efs 10-22 . works well but gives very very slight chromatic aberrations on the widest angle sometimes . maybe should get the thin version .  
2	  Tried wireless headphones .. required frequent charging and I always experienced static noise from interference . No such problem with this extension cord . However this product was ALMOST too short for me to use . Take note of the distance from your TV to your couch and add a few feet so that you can move a bit and any additional length you 'll need to get the cord around the edge of your TV to the plug in the back ( if it is in the back and not the side or bottom ) .  
1	  I purchased an arbitrary Koss headset from a non-name electronics store in South Africa , which blew my mind with its quality for 4 full years before breaking whilst changing continents . Porta pros are fantastic and have been my staple ever since . I decided to splurge on this unit , hoping to get something more like the ( arbitrary ) full size headset I mentioned initially . Koss normally sounds great to me , I am not an audiophile , but some headsets are better than others and Koss is the best I have heard . This set did not deliver on this basic actuality , and I drastically prefer the sound from even Porta pros over this . I don't know if my set is broken or not , or whether the 3.5 mm jack I am driving it from simply lacks the oomph required to make these sound decent . I consider myself to be relatively robust , and these headphones seriously put a kink in my neck , which I could tollerate if the sound quality warranted it .  
2	  The first thing I want to note about these speakers is that they are larger than you imagine $ 200 worth of speakers would be . I purchased a 7.1 capable Onkyo receiver a couple years back and had been using some cheap speakers from a HTIAB set and finally decided it was time to upgrade . Based on a lot of reviews these were the best speaker option in a 7.1 set for under $ 300 so i went for it . Fortunately I had them shipped to my mom 's house since having this huge box sitting outside my ground floor apartment all day would have surely attracted attention ! Now that they are home I realize that they will just not fit with how my living room is configured . I will need to rearrange everything , but boy is it worth it ! The sound from these speakers is amazing , and I haven't even tweaked the setup yet . For the price , I don't think you can fail with this set .  
1	  While this may be good for something , I was looking for extended range for piggybacking hot spots . This is no better , actually worse than , my internal antenae on the laptop .  
2	  This bag is plenty big for me ; I have a D-200 with an 18-200 lens attached most of the time and it fits vertically into the bag just fine . There is also room for another couple of lenses , flash , batteries and other accessories . I wouldn't want to carry around any more . The only problem I have with this bag is the shoulder strap that I wish was wider , or had a padded piece over the shoulder . If you fill this bag , it can get to be a pretty heavy load . All in all though , it 's a well-constructed , functional bag at a reasonable price .  
2	  Here are a few details you should know about the Tetra Hub . You have to buy the darn thing to figure this out . The Tetra Hub must be connected to a USB 2.0-compliant host in order to function in high-speed mode ( 480Mbps data rate ) . If the Hub is connected to a USB 1.1-compliant host , it will operate only in low-speed or full-speed mode ( 1.5Mbps / 12Mbps ) . Note : The Hub itself will always connect to the host as either a full - or high-speed device , never as a low-speed device . Any idiot that tries to use this with an old USB 1.0 PC port will find it does not work , duh ! These are the people who write Amazon reviews denigrating a product and they have not a clue as to how it is supposed to function . I really like the one where someone at Belkin tech support said to take it back and go buy someone else 's hub , i.e. " GO AWAY ! " The Belkin Tetra Hub provides four downstream USB ports that offer backward-compatible , Plug-and-Play connectivity with all USB devices , including USB 1.1 ( or low - and full-speed ) devices , as well as with USB 2.0 ( or high-speed ) devices . This includes such peripherals as scanners , printers , mass-storage devices , and high-resolution cameras . The Hub is self-powered if you use the supplied AC adaptor , which allows the cascading of devices with additional hubs , so that up to 127 USB devices may be connected to a single port . The Hub features neat multicolor LEDs that indicate the operating speed of each connected USB device and the speed of the link to the host computer . More on this feature in a minute . The TetraHub offers several important advantages over traditional USB 2.0 hubs . Most important is its implementation of the new " Quad TT " architecture . Simply stated , when connected to a USB 2.0 host controller , each of the TetraHub 's four downstream ports deliver a full 12Mbps of USB bandwidth for low - and full-speed devices while still providing total support for high-speed devices . This is especially important when connecting multiple , bandwidth-intensive , full-speed devices such as USB webcams , speakers , scanners , and external storage devices . BACKGROUNDThe USB 2.0 specification includes three separate modes of data transmission . These are defined as low-speed ( 1.5Mbps ) , full-speed ( 12Mbps ) , and high-speed ( 480Mbps ) . The Belkin TetraHub appears to be the only USB hub on the market today that provides a visual indication of a connected device 's speed . This is accomplished using Belkin proprietary speed indication circuitry . Each downstream port on the Hub has a corresponding LED that changes color according to the speed of the connected device . Connection Speed - LED colorLow - GreenFull - RedHigh - AmberIn addition , the upstream port has a corresponding LED that indicates the speed of the computer 's USB host controller . Host Controller Speed - LED colorFull - RedHigh - AmberIMHO this is an unusual USB hub that is worth every penny Belkin gets . I just wish they had built this technology into the 7-port hub that features two ports on top for my flash drive . I do not work in the computer industry or for Belkin . As I look at my desk , I notice I have a few other products from Belkin that have been very ssatisfactory over the last few years . I hope this Tetra USB HUB continues that experience over time .

2	  It is so expensive to buy an HDMI cord in the store ( $ 30 ) and this one works just as well .  
2	  Before a friend of mine showed me his Sandisk Sansa View , I was almost ready to purchase the Zune because I was impressed with the navigation , sound quality , and the heavy feel of quality the Zune seemed to possess . However , when I found out that Zune made you get Zune Marketplace and did not even work with Windows Media Player , I became disillusioned . However , I got to actually play with my friend 's Sansa View , I was impressed with the feel of the quality , the capabilities of drag and drop from Windows Explorer ( not available with Zune or iPod ) , sound quality , the same feel of switches and navigation , and the fact that it will hold other types of files as a huge memory stick . If you decide to purchase a Sansa View , you need to do three things before playing with your View and installing mp3 's . ( 1 ) : Go to the Sansa site and dowload the media converter and most importantly the pdf advanced instruction manual ( the manual that comes in the Sansa box is worthless ) . ( 2 ) : Make sure that your mp3 's are properly tagged per the ID3v2 standard because the ease of navigation within the View to your songs is heavily dependent on the proper tags . ( 3 ) : If mp3 books from other sources , re-number chapters 1-9 as 01-09 to keep the flow proper or else it will list as 1,11,12 .. 2 , 20 , 21 .. etc . and play in that order causing some confusion . Pros : Drag and drop from windows explorerno ties to speciality software ( iTunes or Zune Marketplace ) sound quality ( with other headphones ) expanding storage with microSD cards . audible . com compatibleflash memoryCons : limited selection of cases and expense of cases . headphones ( earbuds too big ; sound crappy compared to other headphones I have from Sony , Samsung , Koss , Philips ) poor documentation in the box . wished it had 7 band eq instead of 5 band eq to better tune your sound .  
2	  This is a great buy . It is very easy to use and quite sturdy . It 's an excellent value .  
1	  bought this one for a trip to NY . I was very disappointed because it blocked a blind spot on my right . Returning the item to Best Buy and looking for a better one .  
1	  This mouse worked fine when I first got it , but now it 's just not functioning . It 's so slow to move the arrow , and I have to click three or more times to get whatever I 'm clicking on to respond . I 've changed the batteries , and still no luck . This is a real piece of junk . Don't buy it !  
1	  The radio is okay for AM & FM Reception . It has good FM Stereo Sound . However , The main reason why I bought the Grundig Yacht Boy 300 PE Was for the Short Wave Band . The reception is terrible and often non existing . If you want this radio for travel , be sure to bring an external antenna with you . Otherwise look for a better quality short wave .  
1	  Received the box - looked fine . Opened the box - computer had obviously been thrown several times during transit , one entire side smashed - screws were even bent . Returned to Amazon , was told we would be shipped another one as soon as UPS reported ours as returned . Did not happen - were given projected ship date of June 28 AFTER it was received back by Amazon . Delivery date was to be July 5th . Called this morning - item unavailable - MAY get back in 6-8 weeks . We were never notified of this , very poor customer service on the part of AMAZON .  
1	  I had the 2200 lest than 2 hours , and bang freeze up 's , than pexls , then nothing . Brought it back , i " m waiting for my next new one HA  
1	  D-link really needs to figure out why this camera locks up all the time . Their knowledge base only says to unplug it and plug it back in when it locks up ( so D-Link obviously knows this is a problem ) . Sure enough , that does the trick , but when it locks up while you 're accessing it remotely from the internet ( i.e. you 're simply not home to unplug it and reset it ) , you 're out of luck - camera is dead until you get home to fix it . This maddening problem really ought not to exist in a 400 dollar camera .  
2	  I 've owned Palm units since the very first one came out under U.S. Robotics . This is the finest unit I 've ever used . It is super fast right out of the box and the keyboard is a dream . The color is excellent and there 's enough memory for anything plus the ability to use SD memory . I couldn't care less about the absence of Bluetooth and sure don't care about the sound . I didn't buy it to play with . I bought it for business . ( IRS - did you see that ? ) And for business , it just can't be beat . The unit is not too hefty or bulky . It 's just right . The net now has lots of accessories for it and Palm has a firmware upgrade which takes care of some of the issues other reviewers have mentioned . This is a wonderful unit and I highly recommend it to serious business users . If you want something to play with , choose something else or get a second unit for play . By the way , I 've found Palm support to be fast and very good this time around . Be sure and ask all your questions during the first 90 days of ownership , however . After that , there 's a fee .  
1	  I bought this specifically for my son 's Nintendo Wii . It does NOT work with Wii ; therefore I have absolutely no use for it .  
1	  There 's really not much to tell anyone except that this work for a month and then died . I 've no idea why .  
2	  A few USB ports burnt out on my computer and this comes in handy . Def a great product . BUY IT NOW  
2	  I 'm not an expert on electronics but this is the 2nd mp3 player I 've owned . I chose to buy this mp3 player for work inside a warehouse handling package and for use at school , walking around . Overall , I 'd say its a pretty good player but there are some questions about the durability and lifespan of it . Pros : - cheap price compared to other mp3 players of the same memory-expandable memory-durable design .. supposedly waterproof ( not anxious to test that claim tho ) - acceptable yellow color and appearance-nice joystick function ( in my opinion anyway ) - GOOD wrap around ear phones ( just wanted the basics ) - very nice looking and durable belt clip ( never used armband ) Cons : - battery life ( 1 AA is only 8 hrs for me .. equals only about 2 days of work and campus use , but then again I 'm going to buy rechargeables anyway ) - software use ( isn't as easy to use as it could be , kinda confusing sometimes ) - * Once had a problem with the player when it only played 39 songs when I actually had 50 or so on it , worrisome error * - can only create playlist on software ( quite common tho ) - * list of songs is always alphabetized , NOT BY WHAT ORDER THEY ARE SET UP IN * VERY ANNOYING * In spite of these cons tho , I 'm happy with my purchase and would buy them as gifts to other sporty and gymgoing friends .  
1	  Not at all what I wanted ! Company has been extremely difficult to work with . This was a gift for son and still have not resolved .  
2	  This was a great find ! I do Scentsy candles and I strapped this to grid wall and used for my plugin display ! works wonderfully ! And you can get two on one grid wall section .. which holds 16 plugins ! Tripp Lite SS7415-15 Multiple Outlet Strip w / Surge Protection 15-Amp 16 outlets 15ft Cord 450 Joules  
1	  This little modem , was supposed to be jewel of the dial-up modem range . Capable of handling the new v . 92 standard among other things . Plugging in was not point and click , and drivers needed to be installed first . After which i unsuccessfully got the thing working with my isp . eventually after much sweat and altering of the myriad of settings - which makes it difficult to navigate , time consuming and unless you 're a techie , useless - got connected at 12 kb / s . I checked the line , and computer settings , but no luck at increasing the bandwidth . The hype of such a modem has gone to the heads of its maker - it doesn't work properly , and needs to be corrected . All in all it was a shocking disappointment . On the positive side , the fax part of the modem works beautifully with no hassle whatsoever - how strange ?  
2	  I use Sony tapes in my JVC camcorder . This tape worked great . My camcorder runs like new .  
2	  Polaroid is a popular camera brand , especially its instant cameras . Unlike other cameras such as Kodak , Canon , and Vivitar , it is self-protected when you close the front top hood down . It is well prolonging and does not require any batteries at all . All you need is brand new or fresh Polaroid 600 , 600 Plus , or 600 Platinum film which can be inserted into the base of the camera . Then , a green light appears / glows and you will be set to take awesome pictures . Another reason why this camera is popular is because you get the pictures instantly .  
2	  Transaction went smoothly , with no problems . Would use their services again . MV  
2	  This is my first review , I realized that these reviews are extremely helpful when deciding to purchase a product blindly . I bought this item several months ago , it has worked fantastically , although I did have some trouble with the VHS part of it , my suggestion would be to also buy a VHS head cleaner . I have not have any serious problems with it . That was my only disgruntle . To this day it stills works fantastic and it will look wonderful on your shelf ! It is a wonderful product ! Its so good I purchased it as a gift !  
2	  The Lasko fan was delivered very quickly and was easy to assemble . It moves the air very well and is reasonably quiet at high speed . At the lower speeds , sound is virtually undetectable . The price is more than fair . As a previous poster pointed out , the pictures show the fan to be white , but it is , in fact , grey . This does not matter to us , as it is used in a large master bathroom suite where there is no air movement when the house is closed up for air conditioning , but it may make a difference to others and should be noted .  
1	  Waste of money . Put what you would spend on this coverage and put it into a savings account for 2 years and only spend it if whatever you are covering breaks outside of the 1-year manufacturer 's warranty . Chances are you 'll never spend that money because most major electronics will last longer than the coverage period .  
1	  So I read all these great reviews about this headphone and had to run out and get these . I already had the wrap-around headphones that came with my RCA Lyra , but after reading these reviews , I thought that I couldn't go wrong buying these as an upgrade . I couldn't have been more wrong . Listening to my stock ( $ 9 at Wal-Mart to replace ) RCA headphones and then listening to the PMX60 one after another I was shocked to find that the RCA headphones actually sounded better . Some reviewers even talked about bass being great . I have no idea what those people were talking about since that was the most distinct area where the ( $ 9 have to mention that again ) RCAs were better . Something should have clicked when I noticed that many of the reviewers had iPods . Yes it is true that ANY headphone will sound better than an ear bud . Going from tiny ear buds to headphones without having anything else to base your comparison is the only reason I can think of for the large amount of erroneous reviews . * This headphone is no better than any other replacement wrap-around headphone .  
1	  Doesn't print black , only color - and it 's not that old . Have tried three black toner cartridges and none work . This was the backup to my Dell 920 - all-in-one printer that has the same problem !  
2	  Works great . Slight glitch when first hooking it up . My internet provider resolved the issue . Great price .  
1	  not easy to navigate . can't choose a song . basic .  
2	  Polk audio is excellent sound for price . I have smaller Klipsch speakers that produce better sound , in my opinion . They are too expensive to justify for all of the speakers in my house , though :) Can't speak much to the highs and lows . My center channel 's got amazing highs , and my sub takes care of the lows . These complete the surround , and I have no issues with what they produce .  
2	  This device is easy to use and fun to use . You can track the energy use of any plug in 110volt appliance in your home or garage . I would give it five stars if it had a backlight so that you could read it without a flashlight , and I would also like very much if it had a battery backup for data storage so that it could be read without being plugged in after you are done . With those two improvements , I would have given it five stars .  
2	  It came fast and well nothing broken it works fine and does everything its supposed to do so its great .  
2	  These speakers came standard with my new dell computer . for the standard speaker package they are amazing . I 'm a college student and these speakers are sufficient for my room . However I 've gotten pretty into sound and gaming and now I am looking for a fuller system . These speakers are good for a basic user , but the bass isnt very high output and they lack true multi channel feel . All in all if your just looking for basic pretty loud speakers for your music and games these are the speakers to go with , but if you want very high quality accurate multi channel speakers go with a true 4.1 or 5.1 system .  
2	  This isn't a professional camera but for snapshots , its a dream ! Its very easy to use if you handle the camera like any 10 year old would . ( Just start hitting buttons , till you 've figured out how it works . ) My only issue is taking pictures of trees and flowers . There is a setting for this scene , but no matter what I do , the shots come out almost unreal looking . Pictures of people come out great ! :) The software is useless unless you have Windows 98 , but the camera itself works without the software on any higher programs like XP.I was hoping to make larger prints from this camera , but I 'm beginning to think its not going to produce anything larger than an 8 1/2 x 11 . I think its partly the fault of digital printers thoough .  
1	  I was a HP printer fan until I purchased the 7140xi . I purchased it because it came with a print server & networking capabilities for my home LAN . After 40-50 hours on the phone with HP Support ; calling friends for technical support , weeks of frustration , and many installs / uninstalls later-the HP printer is being returned . I could not get the HP software to install on my desktop with Windows XP-Home . I was able to install the HP Director software on 1 Windows 2000 laptop but not on another W2K laptop . My advice : consider another multifunction . I just ordered a Canon Multipass 730 & have given up on a networked multifunction for my home LAN .  
1	  I bought the MacBook Pro 2.2Ghz in May 2008 with 1600 $ . I was very excited . Usually , laptop performed very well and I enjoyed the MAC OS X ( I work in IT for 9 years with Windows95-Windows7/2003Server-whatever , Linux and now .. Mac OS ) . However : Problems I had in these 3 years : - battery broke : one year max . ; I said , OK , this is normal for all laptops what can I expect , no problem ; then I looked at the price for a new battery and I said ' mehh .. a bit much ' and never bought it . - from time to time after 1.5 years max . , I got grey screens and the screen wouldn't come up ; I needed to try and reboot the laptop multiple times . - overheated when I put an Windows 7 dual boot at some time and found out it 's a Bootcamp driver issue for the FANs or something like it ; the FANs were not spinning at max speed in Windows 7 but only up to 3000-3500rpm ( instead of 6000rpm in Mac OS X ) ; I deleted the Windows 7 and put VMware with Windows 7 in Mac OS X and .. was OK with it . - After 2 years , I couldn't see anything on the screen no matter how many times I tried to boot-up . I took it to an authorized Apple dealer in my country to look at it and I payed around 80 euros for investigation - they said maybe the NVIDIA chipset problem but after further investigation they said it something wrong with the logic board actually but they managed to make it work but they won't guarantee it will last for long ; they offered 3 months of warranty ; it cost me an additional 50Euros for this . - After exactly 3 years , again the same problem , but I moved to different country still in Europe ( Belgium ) ; they told me the investigation costs 85Euros and I payed ; after 5 days they made a report : logic board faulty , total costs 1287 Euros ! Now , I ask you , any smart guy out there , who the hell will pay for this ? And why should I buy ever again a MAC ? So many problems , so EXPENSIVE repair ? This is outrageous .. and this was IT for me : I 'll switch to a normal DELL / HP / Whatever laptop instead . Not to mention , that I think this is very well calculated : instead of repairing , buy a new laptop - forced . In conclusion : 1 ) it really doesn't matter what to buy because all the components are the SAME , CHINA made and eventually after max 2-3 years will brake . This is our world today . Just buy a regular laptop with + years of warranty if possible and that 's the best option . 2 ) if you have money to spend , go for it . Sincerely , A Former Customer . PS > I also have an iPhone 4 and wanted to buy MacBook Air because I saw the new technology in it , but after this .. I quit the idea ; it doesn't worth it .  
2	  I love music .. I 've invested in high-end home systems and even systems in my cars .. but never really spent money on quality headphones . Now , after owning these for a few months .. I wish I bought these years ago ! To be honest , I haven't compared these to other high-end headphones , but I can tell you these are great . Music sounds amazing , and I was impressed at how clear the highs are , smooth the mids are , and how deep and clear the bass is . Not muddy or overbearing bass , but very clear and deep bass . And I listen to hip-hop ( the good stuff like Lupe Fiasco and J. Cole ) .. I 've unwittingly beaten these up here and there , but they still work fine for me ( but after reading other reviews , my fingers are crossed ) . The fit is comfortable and easy .. I 've even given up listening to my high end system and just jam with these to give my neighbors some peace .. something I would never do with my old crappy headphones . Anyways , buy them .. you 'll like them . Only complaint is that they say it 's a tangle free cord , but I 'd beg to differ .  
1	  The product may be fine in other circumstances , but it didn't function for us . I don't know if it was damaged in shipping ( the box showed some rough treatment - it was shipped in a plastic bag ) or it wasn't the proper charger for our ipod . Whatever , we had to go to a store to buy a different one .  
2	  I have used this cable reliably for more than a year , frequently plugging and unplugging without failure . Audio quality coming out of an xbox360 as a headphone preamp line is phenomenal .  
2	  This is a great item to purchase when your old cable gets old and broken apart . I 'd highly recommend it .  
2	  I bought this for my self for Christmas . The large screen is nice . Entering destination points is easy but it took me a few minutes to fiqure out how it wanted the data entered . ( Street name first then then street number ) It has a tremendous amount of menue options but the one thing I have not been able to find is a way to cancel navigation . That would be very helpful if you change your mind because it will keep trying to direct you to that destination .  
1	  One day it just stopped playing in the middle of a song , only six months after purchase and used very little . Nothing Creative says will help fix it and of course I 'm out of luck , big waste of money .. don't buy this you have been warned !  
2	  I got this 3D mouse specifically to use with Autodesk Inventor and Solidworks and it works great with both of them . Not only that , now that I 'm used to navigating with it - I struggle whenever I don't have it , it is 100 % more intuitive than the native navigation you have to battle with your 2D mouse . For anybody doing much 3D CAD work , you gotta get one ! I 'm impressed with the quality look and feel of the unit and how well it stays put even when you pull vertically up on it . It took me about 10 minutes to get the drivers installed and the " feel " configured to my liking in both apps . Highly recommend this unit !  
2	  I 've had this unit in my htpc for 4 years now without a hiccup . Zalman invented the idea of silent power suppliers and I love them . This unit is silent and the modular cables are plentiful and of very high quality . I also have their their 420 watt model in my main PC and it is 6 years old and never had a problem . There are other good options out there now for silent psus , but you can't go wrong with the quality of the Zalmans .  
2	  I had a WatchGuard FireBox router before this and I always had problems with my VoIP , so I looked this up . I enjoy the easy setup that Linksys offers . The Storage Link needs a bit of work , but it works even if you have a Active Directory controlled network at home like me . The gigabit speed is cool to boot . All of this for under $ 200 ! Oh did I forget it has Wifi Pre-N , but that is worth $ 150 by itself . The pricing is very aggressive for everything you get .  
2	  Lets face it folks .. where else could you buy two dvd players that can work together to play one dvd , or by themselves to play two at a time . Price out two units from the factory , or roof top installed aftermarket . Plus , if you open up a used unit sold by amazon .. why is the maker of the unit to blame .. lol . Face it .. If you put these in the back seat with the hands of a 7 y / o , they will break in short order . They are meant to be used gently , not pried open .. the clip is plastic , not steel . These are our second and third Venturer DVD players .. Our first 10 inch unit is still going strong , and our only complaint is the motor that spins the disk is a bit loud .. but considering it 's only 6 inches from the driver or passengers ears behind the headrest .. I can't say if this is normal noise from a DVD player .. When was the last time you stuck you head 6 inches from your home dvd player to watch a movie .. This is a cheap product , and disposable at only $ 189.99 from stores like Walmart . If it lasts 3 years .. thats $ 33 bucks per child for in car entertainment .. money well spent .  
2	  We 've tried several , and this is the first one that works the way it should . It 's being used in a Ford Focus , and it works beautifully . I highly recommend it .  
1	  I purchased these lenses and they did not work on my P880 . They crop the corners very badly and I tried many changes with the set up . The seller was very good and issued me a RMA . I was refunded the price of the lenses ; however , not the shipping costs from and back to them .  
1	  It appears that the following steps may remedy the scroll wheel problem : 1 . Turn on your computer with the USB receiver plugged in . 2 . Once your computer has booted up , remove the batteries from your mouse . 3 . Re-insert your batteries . The scroll wheel should work normally now . I know the above may sound silly , but I have tried it on two separate mouse and they worked ( for me ) .  
2	  Good set of comfortable in ear phones . Inexpensive , & comfortable ! My only drawback on them is the bass . Ive never been a big fan of lots of bass , and these phones kick out more than what I am used to . But for $ 6 , I am impressed .  
1	  Well the price was really good for the 4 pack of Maxell VHS tapes that I purchased but the quality of the recordings after 2 or 3 times was awful . Whatever I recorded - the audio was fine but the picture just kept rolling . If you put the VCR on pause and then hit play it plays ok for a few seconds and then it starts rolling all over again . When I try to rewind the tapes 2 of the 4 tapes stop rewinding and shut the VCR off . When I turn the VCR back on , the tape pops out and I have to go over to the set and push the tape back in and hit rewind again . It takes about 3 or 4 times of doing this to get back to the beginning of the tape . VERY annoying . It 's not the VCR as I have tried it in a couple of different machines with the same results . I guess the old saying is true that you get what you pay for . I 'll go back to the high grade VHS tapes when I place another order and see if they are any better .  
1	  Very frustrated . After only the 3rd use , the speaker system completely shut down . I 've tried everything and even had some techy friends try and figure it out . Of course the original boxes and packaging are long gone in the trash . The speakers and receiver are soon to follow . Complete waste of money .  
2	  I bought the Creative ZEN 60GB two years ago . I did a lot of research before making my choice . Back then , it offered the most for the price compared to other similar players on the market . I bought it on Dell . ca for 350 $ with free shipping . I can only give it 3.5 now because there are other products out that offer a similar or better package for about the same price . Pros : - Wide glossy screen - Various options such as address book , equalizer , random play , FM radio .. - Easy to set up and navigate through . - The software is not necessary to transfer content . - Software is easy to use and understand . - Large storage space . - Reads and plays different file types . - Great for long car rides or waiting periods . Watching movies makes time go faster when waiting at the hospital . - AC adapter as well as USB available to charge the player . - Reads many types of memory cards . ( this is great for example when you are on vacation and you want to dump all of your pictures from your card onto it ) . - Fast file transfer ( except for some exceptions when using the software ) Cons : - Player freezes once in a while and have to reset it by removing the battery . Then have to wait for it to build the library again . - Battery life could be better - Battery symbol is always full until low battery message shows up and the player dies . Basically , you never know at what level the battery is . - No Blue Tooth or other wireless option integrated . - Accessories are hard to find and are expensive . - The integrated speaker is useless for music and movies . - No embedded games or options to download games . - weight - bulky ( especially at the gym ) I am pretty much satisfied with my player in general . I would have probably been a bit more disappointed if I had bought it for more than 400 $ .  
1	  Don't waste your time with this product . It isn't that the device is bad , it 's actually pretty good , but the software is the worst and keeps getting worse with every new release and update . To show you how bad this software is , Microsoft has an entire web site devoted to trouble shooting problems ! Instead of developing the web site , maybe they should should 've made a better effort on the software . If you don't mind headaches , wasted hours , and never getting the program to work correctly , then by all means buy this . Otherwise I suggest the iPod . The higher price is worth it .  
2	  I bought this unit off ebay for $ 40.00 in the door . I am an audiophile with more than $ 70,000.00 of audio equipment in the house and bought this on a whim for my girlfriends house who is happy with an AM / FM radio if you know what I mean . First she had no idea how to run an Ipod , smart woman just electroniclly challenged . Plugged it in , plugged in the ipod and off you go . Easiest thing on the plant , sounds great and would loose and arm if I tryed to bring it back to my place . Just bought another tonight for $ 36.00 including shipping . Oh ! This thing looks great and very well built . Beautiful black piano finish . BUY ON YOU WON'T BE SORRY .  
1	  The only way to power this mp3 is to plug it into a computer . If your battery is low , you must get your computer NOT another battery , or battery charger to fully charge the Network Walkman . The cost of running a computer for power of a Walkman is Madness . It 's cheaper to buy a lot of new batteries or a battery charger . It just so happens that the power company and the vga monitor , etc .. does not support the Bean . The sliding cover is difficult to control , since it acts as part of the charging , playback and hold options . The Bean design is to hold in your hand palm between fingers . If you put it in your pocket , there goes that sliding cover . So one should walk around holding the bean in their hand . When I charged the bean and left it unused for a couple weeks , it discharged fully and I needed my vga monitor , Intel processor chip , the mother board , USB port , power supply etc .. computer again . It also has a very unfriendly user interface . No neck strap ( except China model )  
1	  This case did not fit the Canon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera . It was too small . My son cut the top off for the camera to fit and clipped to his belt .  
1	  I would have given this a ZERO if possible . At first glance , I thought this computer was my dream come true as I am a law student with no money that was in need of a cheap but good quality laptop that was ultra light and portable . On paper it seemed I had found just such a computer , but as they say if it looks too good to be true it probably is . Buying this computer was like throwing money into the fire as I literally watched it fall apart before my eyes . The fan is extremely loud ( like my classmates turned around and looked at my loud ) , the battery only last at most 2 hours ( less if running iTunes , listening to a CD or watching a DVD ) and it gets extremely hot when used for more than 2 hours - both on your wrists while typing and on the bottom making it very difficult to actually sit in your lap . My internal wireless broke as did my CD burner in less than 3 months . Sometimes it also had issues reading CDs . Final Straw for me : I plugged in my computer and a spark shot out from the side of the computer and I smelled burning plastic or something . Customer service is horrible : hard to get through , long holding , often problems finding someone who speaks English clearly . Each time I have spent a min . of 45 min to 1 hour . Spent 3 hours last time over spark fiasco to finally talk to someone who tells me I have to send it in and they may or may not cover all of the above problems under the warranty . The entire time my computer was in the shop they could not tell me anything about the progress , not even if they received it . One of the only positives is that I did get it back quickly , but within 2 day the fan is extremely loud again , the CD burner still doesn't work , the internal wireless is spotty at best , and it still gets flaming hot to the touch . Finally I just decided that I couldn't handle it anymore and I needed something I can count on so I broke down and bought a new Gateway that actually works after less than a year of having this piece of crap . Bottom Line : Run Away ! * Update 1/06 : Two friends who had same model have both since had almost the exact same problems . From what I have read the trend seems to be they are great for about 6 months ( thus the shining reviews ) then start to self destruct .  
2	  Don't waste your money here , get it on Ebay , make sure its a reputable seller , like accessories4less , i just got this exact cable for 37 bucks with shipping , monster name , exact same one , very happy w / the quality and price .  
2	  it one of best products that i have bought so far and i also like it because it long . cdascoakvpaldVB vn MzfvlJOFGJQOJTGOQEJAVGAENBG ; HBJQP  
1	  Before signing and accepting delivery of any Toshiba DLP , be sure to check the screen to make sure that the coating on the inside of the screen is uniform . On mine , there was a circle about 10 " in diameter that you can see in certain lighting and even when the TV is off ! It will appear lighter than the surrounding areas at times and can be annoying . I called Toshiba and had a service man come out and even though he acknowledged that this is common , Toshiba will not replace the screen . I would have given them a negative 10 if it were possible just because of their attitude . So , look at the screen VERY carefully before accepting or purchasing . If you see this problem , refuse to accept it . Or else just buy a Samsung or Mitsubishi DLP to avoid the problem I have .  
1	  Having used one of these before which is still working , imagine my disappointment when this prroduct 's gteen light came on , then the red light followed by an explosion and burning odour . Before I refer you to my solicitor , tell me how a chap in the uk gets a trplacememt from usa !  
1	  This alarm system was bought to protect my garage . The install was super simple , and the unit worked well in the house . The reason for my low rating was because they advertise a 450 ft range for the sensors , but at about 60 ft it would not work . It all fairness , I was told by a local alarm installer that none of the wireless units will transmit through aluminum siding . If you have any siding besides metal I assume it would work .  
1	  I bought this unit several months back for my office . Its clock light is hard see unless the office light is office .. which makes it a bit hard to work . The tuner is analog and to small scale to be able to get any one station easily . I have not tried the CD player yet . I happened to see this unit on Amazon while looking for its replacement and decided to rate it . Very disappointing for a Sony product .  
1	  It is junk ! This was a " nearly new " used unit about a year old . The previous owner had run it only a few times before switching to another unit and mothballing this one . I ran it about 5 to 6 times before all control inputs , either via the remote or directly on the unit , froze . You can view the live video inputs , but that is all you can do ! From other negative user inputs on this unit , you get the idea that Samsung really put out a bad design in this unit . Stay away from it , especially " used " units as people are dumping them ! When it did run , the " search " feature was very slow , even with only a few days recorded . I experienced a lot of the same problems others experienced with the exception of the hard drive failure . You are fairly warned !  
1	  This is for a PowerMac G5 , or so the label says . I haven't tried this on older G4 computers so I don't know if this really needs a driver that 's built in a G5 or something . I got this for the heck of checking what it can do for me . Nothing really . 1 . First of you have to know that this adapter connects to the DVI port , not the old ADC port . What this means is that the Aluminum displays for the G5 model use DVI . This being the case , then you have a problem right there to fight over the port . Unless you have the high-end optional nVidia GT card with dual-DVI port , then the stock ATI 9600/9800 cards come with one DVI and one ADC . So I would think people with G5 have or are thinking of upgrading to the Aluminum display then you will be needing an ADC to DVI converter to hold the monitor and TV at the same time . That makes using the two " monitors " with respective adaptors . Why ? ! Unless Apple envisioned phasing out the ADC port soon , it makes no sense . And if they did envision to phase out the ADC then why release cards with the G5 that still have an ADC port if the new monitors use DVI and this adapter also uses DVI . Are they trying to make money selling adapters ? 2 . I haven't seen a perfect computer to TV interface from major video card manufacturers the same way Matrox has perfected it . What Matrox has done for dual monitors with one using a TV is that it automatically routes the video signal to the TV . If it detects your playing a movie file , it just brings it out to the TV as a full screen . No need to drag your windows into that screen and then making it into full screen . This adapter and the software interface doesn't do it . It just makes your TV into another monitor with extremely low resolution , naturally . The point of adding a TV as a monitor is to obviously put make multimedia viewing experience more enjoyable and hassle-free . If you play a QuickTime file or a DVD movie in your computer , you would want it to be played on your TV . Nope , not here . You will have to drag it then make it full screen . But it doesn't stop there . Try opening another application and that full screen on the TV monitors automatically switches back into one within a window . Very stupid and annoying . So I believe they should follow the footsteps of Matrox and create a custom software that will allow to do just that . Put a check box if you want your video automatically output on the TV , on a window , in the first monitor , second monitor , etc . 3 . The above suggestion actually works with Final Cut Pro application . But if you 're a video editor , you really wont even need this . You see once you connect your TV via this adapter then you can route your TV as your monitor which is good to check the actual picture quality on a TV screen . It is a cheap solution . However , if you are editing on Final Cut Pro then it would be natural that you have either a video editing card that can output to a TV / monitor while keeping your dual computer monitor active for editing . Or , you have a camcorder with FireWire output or some other similar solution that you can use to route from the computer to camcorder to TV . Using FireWire is actually a better solution that this adapter because it DOES NOT allocate video card memory to the TV via the adapter . By using the adapter to connect to the TV you are eating up video memory between the computer monitor and the TV . So if you have 128MB memory then 64MB goes to each . This slows down the video information and will be evident if you are using big computer screens . By using FireWire the video card does not interfere and allocates full memory to your computer monitor . 4 . The OS isn't even perfect with interfacing to the adapter . You connect the adapter and you 'll need to constantly restart the computer whenever you connect / disconnect it . Simply putting the computer to sleep and waking it won't work . Your video card still thinks the TV is connected despite having no TV nor adapter ( after waking from sleep ) . Shut down the computer , remove the adapter then start to make sure all video card memory is allocated back to your computer monitor . So unless you have a high end video card that can afford to split the memory and an interface that automatically routes the video signal to your TV , this is pretty useless . It 's just for fun to prove that you can output part of your screen to your TV with hassle and all . Skip until they improve the software .  
2	  I was skeptical about claims regarding bass reproduction , clarity , etc . However , once properly set in my ears they deliver astonishing sound . This is great if you have excellent source material . But any flaws in the recording that could in the past hide behind sloppy reproduction will be bright and clear . One caveat : I get the best sound reproduction when the ear buds are set securely in my ear canal . Sony provides silicone cushions of several sizes to accommodate the expected variation in anatomy , but they may still cause some discomfort for some . I find that if I wear them for more than an hour , I run the risk of this discomfort . For relief I simply remove them for about a minute . They also do a fairly good job of blocking out noise from outside-be aware of this if you find yourself in circumstances where you need to hear what 's going on around you .  
2	  Good quality . Works well . Excellent price . In my area we have nearly no " open " stations so I went to a direct feed cable . Still use in vehicles or rental cars that do not have a 3.5mm " in " or usb " in " . Out in the sticks where there are a lot of open frequencies it works fine . Update : As long as you do not live in a metro area like I do Chicago that has a lot of stations and little / no free channels . Does work fine in more rual areas . Actually have new vehicle with usb direct plug in so I 'm passing it along to someone else in the family who can use it .  
1	  very instabil product much packet loss , hangs often und must becold started , BUG : con not operate with hidden SSID !  
2	  The cards are exactly as described and work perfectly in our cameras . They have proven to be a secure place to store pictures for long periods of time .  
2	  We Bought this For Our Daughters Room , As we did not want to spend a ton of money .. to our Surprise this is an Awesome TV / DVD Duo ! ..  
2	  New revision ( Aug 19 , 2012 ) After a few years using this lens I can say that you get what you pay . It is not premium but performance is highly acceptable . 5 stars . If you are not a pro this lens will be a great acquisition and the VR is an outstanding feature , it really works . It is not in the super b lenses range but you can get sharp images and great contrast , the most important features are VR , light weight and price , do not forget the 1.5x factor , I mean finally you are going to have a 105-405 mm lens which is really an advantage when you are trying to capture wildlife . If your budget does not reach a 70-200 VR well this is a good option .  
1	  I purchased the mzm 1 for a major interview , but it 's worse than the camera itself . It claims that the rubber stops the motor sound . What 's a flimsy piece of rubber band going to do ? I have to look into other microphones like the canon dm-50 . Please don't buy it . I know it looks tempting because of its price , but just trust us on this . I did several tests by changing variables such as batteries , wind socks , and zoom / normal , but it just doesn't work ! If I could , I would rate it a zero instead of a one . I don't even understand why it got patented . It 's nothing !  
2	  I saw the small size of this case and was in love . It has plenty of space for dvds and cords ( though it wont hold large headphones unless they fold ) . It is padded enough for protection but not too padded to be too bulky . It 's Great . You wont regret it .  
2	  This GPS was given to my daughte for Christmas . She loves it .  
1	  Buying this camera was a terrible decision . I should have listened to the other negative reviews . We cannot get a picture and there is no sound - if I was expecting how difficult this camera was there 's no way I would have bought this one . I have a brand new computer and this camera is supposed to be compatible with it but obviously it 's not . I have also contacted circuitcity several times for help or to return it but they will not respond , so don't buy anything from them .  
2	  Great camera for portability . Fits nicely in a pocket , holder on your belt or in your hand . The picture quality is not Ansel Adams but then again I 'm not Ansel Adams . Good for work and random pictures anywhere . Would buy another one at any time .  
1	  This case is a complete dirt and lint magnet . It is not ideal for a woman who would keep it in her purse .  
2	  Thought I needed this part for a 2002 Nissan Pathfinder . Double check on Scosche 's website before ordering . The standard Diversity antenna is all you need . Ordering from Amazon with all my other car electronics needs has been a pleasant experience .  
1	  Do not buy if you have XP Service Pack 3 as this product will not work . After 1.5 hours on the ' phone last night with Linksys tech support they were able to tell me that I had to roll back to SP2 or to buy a different Linksys product . Not happy with this at all .  
2	  I bought these for my mother who has 50 % hearing loss . She thinks they are wonderful ; no static - said they are the best present I have ever given her . My father said I gave him a present at the same time since the battle of the competing tv 's ( sports versus Dateline ) had just been about turning the volumes on both TV 's up . ( Though you do have the volume on somewhat for the headphones to be effective . However , my father says he can live with that . ) After trying my mom 's , my sister who is at 5A exerciser would wake her 4 children and husband . Now that she has these headphones , my brother-in-law says the only thing that wakes them up now is her laughter when she watches Nick or TV Land comedies while doing her Schwinn Aerodyne . No technical knowledge here ( though I thank all those who left it in their reviews ) .. just a review on a stellar product .  
2	  Perfect weight . Pen side writes smooth the nub side is soft and accrue . Love it !  
1	  I used this card under Windows 2000 accessing a D-LINK WAP . Installation , setup , configuration , and speed were excellent . I was averaging about 70-90 % link quality and around 6Mbps transfer between PC 's . The DLInk was connected to a cable modem and speed was amazing . I just got an XP laptop and started using this card . Performance has dropped to aroun 20-40 % link quality and MAYBE 1Mbps data transfer . It 's almost like being back to dial-up . The drivers released for XP .. I 've tried reinstalling , using the config utility , not using the config utility , you name it . I have a small condo and I 'm about 50 feet from the WAP as the crow flies . I have a few walls between me and the WAP but that was no problem under Win2K . I 'm VERY disappointed in this thing . ..  
2	  I read a lot of bad reviews before I bought it , but it works great . Sure if you dont know much about mp3 players it may take some getting used to but works great .  
2	  Now I realy don't have to get off the couch . Life is just getting too easy and I don't have to miss my sniper shots . And no I 'm not a camper .  
1	  I bought these headphones for use with my macbook . I wanted something wireless and mobile to use in the office . The nice thing about these headphones is that they can connect directly to the bloothtooth on your macbook ( a previous bluetooth headset I bought only connected to its transmitter ) , and the play / pause , next / prev buttons work with itunes without any additional software . Unfortunately , the sound quality is fuzzy at best , and clearly meant for something less audibly demanding , like voice chat . My laptop speakers sound better than these !  
2	  This is great if you want to just use your TV as your computer screen at fairly low resolution ( 800x600 is the highest I 'd use for a 32 " even though it supports greater ) . If you want to have fantasic resolution , this is not what you want ( instead you should buy a media-center type computer or a graphics card that has tv-out ) . There is some definitely fuzzyness , but I don't mind , being a child of the 1970 's and 80 's - I have seen much worse . I had been searching for something cheap so I could hook a computer up to the TV and use it to play music and some games ( note it doesn't do audio - you just have to plug the audio stuff up directly from your computer to your TV possibly through your VCR or in my case an RCA audio / video switch ) . I just had to plug it up and it worked without any configuration . It is powered by USB that hooks into the computer - so make sure your computer has a USB port . The device doesn't look like the picture shown here . It is a small silver box ( roughly 5 " x2 " x1 " ) that comes with all of the plugs you need . A word of warning , if you are trying to hook your computer up to your TV don't do what I did the first time and by a simple adapter of VGA to s-video / rca video output . It was $ 5 so I said what the heck , but learned later ( by experience and reading on the web ) that adapter won't work unless you hook it to a video card that already supports TV-out and have that card output at a TV resolution ( and the whole point of getting it was because I didn't have a video card that had tv-out ! So instead , just either buy a video card with tv-out or a device like this . Another note , if you go the video card route , be careful . I almost bought one , but saw that it needed at least a 250W power supply . I was using an old low profile PC with 90W power supply , so that wouldn't have worked .  
1	  I just received this case and was intending to use it on a cruise that I am taking for underwater photos so I wouldnt ruin my $ camera . The plastic that it is made out of seems very durable but it is so thick and unmovable that my hands cannot adjust any of the controls on my camera . I just about fit the camera through the opening of the bag . There also is a lot of excess room in the bag ( once you get it in ) that the camera does not stay in place and you have to try to readjust it ( which is almost impossible ) . I have not yet tried to actually use this case for photo taking but I think that it is still going to be useful just to keep my camera dry while taking it to the beach and on ship excursions . I would recommend this bag to someone who wants to keep their digital camera dry but not for picture taking in the water .  
1	  I have had the television for 2 weeks and i am now returning it due to the poor picture quality . Contrast is not good on DVDs , i even tried S-Vid and Component but both did not change the problems . I used Schindler 's List , Lord Of The Rings , and Finding Nemo to try and calibrate the color and contrast . The opening menu for Schindler 's list looked horrible in contrast . You could clearly see three different shades of black and white , which should have blended together . In LOTR during the council of elrond the picture was either too grainy or fleshtone colors on the characters faces were too bright . Finally on Finding Nemo the television had problems finding a medium between making the bright colors too brite or too bland , again no easy medium . The television would also not turn on if i did not turn it off from the rear power switch each time . And after playing Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow for all of 30 minutes there was already burn in on the lower right of the screen . I got the television for 3000 , it might be cheaper than an HDTV but in my opinion its not worth it .  
2	  Unit did exactly what I wanted and freed up a big wire nest behind my equiptment .  
2	  I couldn't believe it . Without running the CD setup deal I was already on the Internet ! This has got to be the easiest setup around . Great signal strength as far as I can tell . Use Bandwidth Place and Speedtest . net speed tests , both show almost as much as my wired speed using wireless ( my one bedroom apartment and my neighbors apartment ( same floor ) two doors down on the other side of the hallway ) My neighbors one floor down , about two doors down on and on the other side of the hallway about 8 to 9 Mbps ( my connection is 20 Mbps ) Not too shabby for an inexpensive router , this replaced my old faithful WRT54GL ( I wanted N for some reason ? )  
1	  the laptop only recognizes it as a usb 2.0 . the actual speed is no faster than usb 1.1 . I 've tried burning dvds , uploading flash drives and ipods . the device did not accomplish the job any faster than my usb 1.1 . maybe i don't have the right driver . in which case , the driver cd they include also sucks . it is nothing more than a compilation of all of the possible drivers that work for this specific hardware . difficult to figure out which driver is the right one . also , the ac adapter is not included . the power plug included has a usb plug at the end . you 'd have to use one of your own usb to power the darned thing . if i am the one at fault for not using the device friendly , then these people are at fault for not being user friendly .  
1	  I should have known when the install disk would not execute on either the Vista or XP machines that this moght be a dud . The microphone on one of the cameras died after 3 uses . Unfortunately , an internet search on how to get rid of the screaching noise revealed that this is a common problem . The software interface for the camera makes it clear that this is not really a Microsoft product . They must have re-branded someone elses software ( and maybe hardware ) . Don't buy this thinking you are getting a quality product from a major company . It 's junk .  
1	  I purchased this item new for about half of what Amazon is selling it for . I thought I was getting a great deal . I found that inserting and removing my brand new SDHC card was very difficult . I checked the contacts of my card and found deep scratches . My conclusion is that the pins are either too stiff or too long . I have no idea why no other reviewer encountered this problem . I did not try any other memory cards with this reader so I can't comment on how it would work with other cards . I was however very disappointed and returned the product for a refund .  
2	  What a great way to show family and friends your pictures ! Sometimes its hard to carry pictures in your wallet & purse but this is an easy way to show off your pics and carry them with you . Had no trouble at all downloading pics to the key chain . Love this item and will be purchasing more for my family . Highly recommend !  
2	  Other than the actual memory card being so small that it would be easy to lose , it is a great product and easy to use .  
1	  I bought this machine to replace a VCR that died . I thought this would be easier than using tapes , but I have to say I 'm gravely disappointed . Pausing live TV is really cool , and skipping commercials is great ! But the unit itself does not seem to be very stable . I 've had it for only 24 hours now , and have already had to unplug it twice to reset due to it either locking up , or a loss of some basic functionality that was only restored with a restart . Maybe this was just a fluke - time will tell . But here 's the real kicker ; you can't use this thing like a VCR unless you sign up for the TiVo service . I 'm really not interested in downloading program guides , advanced searching , season pass recording and all that . I just want to be able to record shows , and watch them later . But the record function is completely disabled unless you sign up for the whole service . So on top of the price of the unit , I have to pay $ 16 a month just to be able to push the record button ! That 's ridiculous ! Who would do that ? The TiVo service is not needed in any way for me to simply record the show I 'm currently watching . That would be like buying a DVD player , and being required to pay a monthly fee just to be able to push play . I can understand if your life revolves around television and you want all the bells and whistles the TiVo service offers . But if you just want to record shows once in a while , you 're much better off with a $ 30 VCR . I had no idea this is how these things worked . Guess I should have done some research first .  
1	  it comes with 2 rech batt . only . 60 min chargr is for charging one single low capacity battery . very disappointed :(  
1	  Do not purchase this product . When I received the item and installed it the lamp lasted 10 minutes and blew out . I contacted customer service for Electrified ( where the product comes from ) and the rep acted as if this happened all the time and was not surprised . After being rather rude to me , she gave me a return authorization number . I had to pay to shipped the defective product myself . I guess sometimes it is worth paying more for better quality . Lesson learned .  
1	  Got mine shipped so fast . Thanks Amazon . The product quality is unknown . The filter glass seems to be intact , however scratch marks are definitely visible on the metal ring . part of of logo B + W is scratched . This item must be a refurbished one .  
2	  Solid design and construction , great speed and very good deal . I just upgraded this 2GB to a 4GB because I needed more space , but for anyone who just needs 2GB , this is the USB flash drive to have .  
1	  I am writing this review so no gets fooled and buys a " transcend memory card along with Sony DPF " the reason is if you have a sony camera it uses separate memory card which can be directly inerted into the sony DPF . I bought this Transcend memory card but there is no way I can save the pictures from my computer to this transcend SDHc card . This is complete waste of money for me as I have no other product I can use this card for . I also do not have a memory card reader . Please do not buy this card unless you have a compatible camera in which this memory card fits . Transcend SDHC memory card does not fit for any SONY camera .  
2	  This is a great little camera ! the photos are quick and clear . processing time is a lot less than my last olympus . This little gem fits in your pocket nicely for quick easy access while on the go . Great little camera .. love it !  
1	  Perhaps this category of transmitter works in a rural or suburban environment . In a city , NYC to be specific , it is unusable . There are no locations on the FM dial which do not have static .  
1	  The remote didn't work as I had hoped it would . It 's just not a reliable remote for even the simplest setup . For example , I programed the remote to work with my DVR . When trying to fast forward through the commercials , I was often unable to get the touch screen to react fast enough to stop at the desired point . This caused a lot of unnecessary frustration . The remote seems like it isn't quite production ready . I would consider the Logitec Harmony instead .  
2	  Samsung ML-2010 Toner reviewWhen I ordered this product , I was originally a little concerned about getting the right toner cartridge for my Samsung printer . I saved all of my online receipt info , just in case , because the price was so attractive . No other office supply store in town could come within double the price we paid . We ordered from Eforcity on April 1st , had the exact toner in place the next week as promised for the cheap shipping ( which I always love ) . The total price with shipping was less than what I would pay locally . This will be my toner source for now . Need the extra money for gas & food nowadays ..  
2	  This camera is awesome . I absolutely love it . It 's small enough to carry in my purse and yet has all the power of a big camera . It 's simple to use , takes excellent photos , takes great video , and has been a great addition to my list of doodads . :)  
2	  Not sure if this router is great for the " non " - techie , but for those of us not shy with trying other firmware . Load DD-WRT on this and you will be very impressed . What happens when everyone around you has a better signal than you ? Increase the gain ! on the antena , If you have trouble with signal 's DD-WRT should help you out . Definetly recomend this !  
1	  I was so excited to get this MP3 player , but have had several problems with it . It keeps freezing up on me which once caused it to overheat and then I LOST all the songs I had painstakingly put on it . I have used it two times since I purchased it at the beginning of January 2006 . I did not have a hard time putting the music on , it is just time consuming . When it works , it works well .  
1	  I bought this printer server partly because of the good reviews here . It works well mostly , but I did encountered a few problems that I feel worth mentioning : 1 . The manual says Internet printing ( LPR ) is supported , but in fact it is not . The related settings mentioned in the manual do not exist in the web admin interface . I am referring to the sections " Printer Tab - Internet Printing " and " Printer Tab - Logical Port " in Charpter 6 of the manual . 2 . A more serious problem is that whenever my printer goes into sleep , i.e. automatically powers off , the USB connection is lost . The only way to get the USB connection back is to unplug and re-plug the USB cable . This is a huge pain to me . I am using Brother HL-6050D .  
1	  This camera has a problem that might not show up for awhile . In my case it revealed itself after a year and two month . One day fingerprint like lines appeared on prints . They are invisible on LCD monitor but cover the picture area on the computer monitor and on prints . Search the Internet and you will find many similar complaints .  
2	  I tried this with my new desktop computer that 's running Windows 7 Professional ( 64 bit ) - it works . I bought this USB external floppy drive because the floppy drive in my old computer stopped working . That old desktop runs the Windows XP Professional operating system . The floppy a : drive would show in My Computer but would not work . When I plugged the USB external floppy drive into one of my USB ports , it showed in My Computer as Floppy b : drive . I was able to read and write to the floppy disks . It works .  
1	  First time I used this item , I was very happy , it did a great job . I blushed ou the hairs and oiled the blades and put away . A couple weeks later when I went to use it again , the blades weren't moving , and I can't get anyone to replace or reimburse me . Don't waste your hard earned money on this product , look else where .  
2	  After moving smudges from one end of my binocular 's lens to the other with a lens cloth , I decided to try something new . It was a good choice because this lens pen is awesome . The brush sweeps away any grit , and the little carbon pad eradicates greasy smudges through some magical voodoo . I give this item all the stars I am able to .  
2	  I purchased this item to extend the range of my Zoom X6 ADSL Modem / Wireless Router . I have used it only as a repeater . It was easy to install and has greatly improved the wireless signal strength in my home . The only draw back is that , in repeater mode , it is only compatible with WEP encrypton and not WPA encryption .  
2	  Pros : 1 . Long battery life up to 50 hours ! 2 . Small and light enough to carry3 . Easy to control with shuttle switch4 . Fancy design5 . AVS function which cares for your hearing abilityCons : 1 . No voice recording function2 . Clumsy detachable clip3 . A little bit expensiveWhat 's your priority when you choose this kinda cool gadgets ? The most important priority for me was battery life . NW-E507 lasts at least twice longer than existing MP3 players , which means you don't have to worry about the battery life when you listen to music . Assuming to play 4 hours a day , you don't need to recharge this for TWO weeks ! I use NW-E507 without taking it out from my pocket because the shuttle is really easy to control . One thing that many people mentioned in previous reviews is that the inconvenience of provided software . I don't quite understand why they are saying that .. It 's not that complicated to use SonicStage . Once you install it , you can transfer mp3 files from your computer to NW-E507 with ease . On top of that you can shrink the size of the original mp3 files so that you can store more songs than other MP3 players with limited memory . Also , there is no problem with recognizing foreign language ( such as Korean ) if it 's supported on NW-E507 . I guess the tip for installing Sonicstage is setting the area the same as the language you want to be displayed on NW-E507 . One annoying thing is the repeat button on the back of the gadget . The button is too small and hard to press when the detatchable clip is attached . I hope SONY improves this later for the forthcoming models . Overall , this is really a great player and I think this is worth $ 150 . I hope this helps ~  
2	  I just starting to use it .. just 12 hours of use in econo-mode ( about 24 real hours ) . It is just what I was looking for to have at home , very good imgage , even if there is some aditional light in the room , and the connection ports are great , it has all and some double ! I use it for movies and gaming ( mainly ) . User friendly , you can start using it very fast and its menu enables a very friendly configuration experience .. you just need to plug anything to it and it will find connection auto . And also for a very good price ! It will be interesting to realize if the lamp works for the expected life-period ..  
2	  gator is a great deal of high-quality product I am very happy to have the purchaseI 've purchased on Amazon . com because the price was low expensive than buying in a shop in canada actually I pay haffe price .  
1	  I installed the stereo with this harness and thought all was ok until I turned off the car an the stereo kept playing . I had a friend look at it and we tried the harness with another stereo . It did the same thing . I went to bestbuy an bought a different harness and the stereo works fine .  
2	  I love my land line phones and the phone is old but still works . The cord was wearing out so looked on line for a new one . I needed almond color . Got this 12 foot cord and it works great . Now I can hand the phone to my husband without having to hand him the base .  
1	  DI-624M is easy to install and provides good signal ( at least within the range of my flat ! ) . However , despite the fact that it is easy to install , it is a massive challenge to make it work efficiently afterward . It usually works okay for some time after installation and re-installation ( which happens periodically ) , but after a while it tends to do its own thing ( looks like this device has the mind of its own ! ) . It connects to the internet , but prevents many programmes from accessing it altogether ( with an exception of Skype , in my experience ) . Pros : 1 ) easy to install2 ) good signalCons : 1 ) settings change without any prior action and / or your intention2 ) settings change without any prior action and / or your intention3 ) did I mention that settings change by themselves ? If you are considering purchasing a router , it would , probably , make sense to try getting some other product . This may prevent you from pain of trying to work out how to make DI-624M function properly .  
1	  Tweeters arrived dinged & dented - considering they are THICK aluminum . Wouldn't even work , gave same result as if the negative & positive were touching . Both stereos in the house went into " Protection " mode when connected to the tweeters . Bought some $ 8.00 for ( 2 ) plastic horn tweeters that gave a nice , crisp high notes like I was looking for . Make sure to keep your packaging in considering to buy from this store - you just will need it for a refund . ABSOLUTE JUNK !  
1	  I just bought the Sony KV-27FS100 on Saturday after spending a couple of weeks researching other flatscreen TVs . In the end , it came down to this Sony model and the Toshiba 27AF43 . I opted for the Sony since I love my 32 " Sony XBR and I really wanted the 16:9 vertical compression mode for watching anamorphic DVDs . Unfortunately , my excitement for this unit was short lived . After physically struggling with the setup ( unit weighs around 100 lbs and is too big to move solo ) , and hooking it up to my digital cable , I powered on the set . Although the picture is great , there was a constant , annoying , fairly loud high pitched noise coming from the set . I turned down the volume , removed all the inputs , tried different power outlets , even turned off the TV 's speakers and the sound remained . After searching the web for " sony high pitched noise " I found other complaints about this same problem . The TV is unwatchable for me at this point , I can't even stand having it on for more than a few minutes ( might be a good thing long term :) A second problem is bad geometry at the bottom of the screen . When my digital cable viewing guide is up , you can clearly see that the bottom edge of the menu - which should be parallel with the bottom of the screen - slopes up from left to right . I could live with this , but the high pitched whine is unbearable . The unit is going back tomorrow . I 'll try a couple other units to see if the problem is just with my set , but will likely go with the Toshiba since the vertical compression wasn't as big a deal as I thought it would be .  
2	  My wife always hated our old scanner . She complained that it was too complicated to use , therefore , I did all the scanning . When it died she was joyous . This scanner is perfect for us . Push one button , it sends the scan to the printer . Now I can remain on the sofa staring at the football game while she does the scanning . Do I care that it 's a little slow ? No ! We don't have a lot of scanning to do . Do I care that it 's a little noisy ? No ! The TV is another room .  
2	  I found these headphones to be a big improvement over the standard Apple iPod headphones and Coby CV series headphones . I listen to a lot of hip hop and really enjoyed the extra bass these provided . However , the nice thing is that it 's not an exaggerated bass . You won't hear the deep lows when listening to Billy Joel , for example . The other great feature is that they come with earbuds in three sizes . I use the small size and they fit perfectly in my ear . I use these while working out and never have any problems with them slipping out . Finally , you have a nice choice of colors and can choose something other than boring white or black . At this price point , I would consider these an excellent purchase .  
2	  This is one of the best cases I have found to house the DVD player I ordered the same day . The player fits perfectly without being too tight to zip it up . I can always find just what I need at Amazon . com .  
1	  I purchased this because of the remote . Unfortunately , it is just not worth waiting for the dock to start . For the unit to start playing music , you have to wait for the dock to respond after you have connected the iPod . The dock takes approximately 3-4 minutes before you can use the remote to control your iPod . The video quality is awful . This dock is certainly not worth the price !  
1	  When I saw this I thought it might be good to place on my sliding glass door for when we are out . So I installed it and set it overnight the first night . I was wakened at 1am by the blaring alarm , too groggy to realize if there was an intruder or not . I dashed to the door , a sitting duck if there had actually been an intruder . Gladly , not . I reset it and was awakened again at 3am by another false alarm ! I can only imagine the 45 degree temperature had something to do with it . It has a little magnet fob that goes next to it , and when the alarm is separated from the fob , the alarm turns on . But two false alarms in one night ? I don't care to try it another night . I can't leave a device like this in my home unattended , it could false alarm while I 'm away , and actually announce to the neighbors that I 'm NOT at home . Into the junk pile , or to the returns desk .  
1	  Had I not destroyed the product I would request my money back . Terrible , impossible to use . I have receipt no product , when I removed it after trying frustatratingly to use it , it was inadvertantly thrown out . I would never buy this productWASTE OF TIME MONEY EFFORT  
1	  I , as a novice buyer , made the purchase for the first time this trading platform . Been looking for a cost-efficient ( up to U.S. $ 50 ) and a small video camera . Now , after three months of negotiations on the return of bad money with this seller , I will only buy the camcorder Brand name and only in the store . But not here ! This camcorder has come in the mail within 25 days . Good packaging , complete disk and user manual in English . Camcorder light only without batteries , they are very gain weight this device . Seen drawbacks : 1 ) video camera refused to work , if you insert a memory card of 2 GB . 2 ) The joystick to switch and select additional functions did not work . 3 ) Video quality - 640x480 pixels awful and poor without additional lighting . 4 ) Image Quality : 640x480 - horrible as the cheap Chinese phones . 5 ) In this unit there is no additional slots for its power through a network of 220 ( only works on AA batteries 4 pcs . ) . Informed of the deficiencies and the seller has decided to bring this camcorder as a device that does not meet the stated characteristics as nadlezhaschschego product quality . The seller was not against a return , but asked to send this camcorder for my account and checking the disadvantage this seller PROMISED offset all my expenses ( cost of its faulty camera + shipping ) . In the money that amount : Order Total : $ 39.74 + $ 17 ( shipping ) = $ 56.17 . Now I 'm trying to return the money spent , but the seller finds a lot of reasons to not return the money . He says that money back to me - but does not specify an amount , on my specific questions about the payment number , the date , the bank through which the return was - the seller to such questions is not responsible and proposes to require the owner of the money marketplace AMAZON ! This is a fraud ! It is unworthy of work of the seller " James Clutterducks " ! Every word I can confirm correspondence with the scammers ! Do not buy anything from him !  
2	  This camera has many benefits that just blow the competition away and makes it a great " prosumer " digital camera . The 8 megapixel resolution allows for pictures to be printed up to 11 x 14 at 300 dpi ( larger if you use 72 dpi ) . And the boot up time is almost instanteous ! Unfortunately it does pain me to mention that the camera does lack true spot metering and also it has a rather loud mirror slap ( not something I would like to use in quiet settings ) . The lens bundled with it is quite adaquate , but I would seriously urge you to consider the 17-85mm EFS IS lens for a larger degree of flexibility .  
2	  I was shocked to read the review by " doctormoon " . I bought the lexar media 1 GB jumpdrive 2.0 pro off a different internet site several months ago , and I have had no problems at all with filename length . out of curiosity , i just renamed a large jpeg file with a 50-character name , and my jumpdrive stored the file no problem . i 'm running windows 2000 . the model number on my jumpdrive is JD1GB-40-500 B. it has been working perfectly and is very fast , i 'd definitely buy one again . hope this helps your buying decision ; i just hated to see such a negative [ and seemingly incorrect ] review for an awesome product .  
1	  I purchased this printer because it was one of the first to get Vista drivers . I wish I would have waited . I have no problem with the printer itself . Its fast , clear , good quality . The software is the worst and they wont update it . I used the printer first wirelessly and then with the ethernet . both were failures , The printer icons would disapear off multiple computers every few days requiring me to reinstall the software . Support wanted me to disable their own printer detection services . Which didn't help . I have 4 computers in my house and I have reinstalled the printer drivers over 40 times in 6 months . Dont buy this if you like doing this . HP support is the worst too . I didnt get help until I figured out the CEOs name and sent him a email directly . BTW Im installing the drivers again while I write this review .  
2	  We bought this camera because our other digital camera ( SONY DSC-H1 ) was too large to carry around a lot of the time . We took it skiing with us ( Whistler , BC ) and it took some outstanding pictures , both of persons and of landscape / scenery . It is small enough that you can pretty much carry it anywhere , anytime . Others may disagree , but the touchscreen menu controls are easy to use and fairly intuitive . Fingerprints do get on the screen but you hardly notice them and they are easily removed ( or better yet , use the little wand they give you with the camera instead of your fingers , that doesn't leave any marks on the screen ) . To summarize : this is an excellent camera , very small size but with a large 3 " LED display , takes EXCELLENT pictures , and the touchscreen menu is easy to use and intuitive . Most people will be very happy with this camera if they buy it . The only negative thing is that this camera does not have a view finder , but unless you have very bright sun at your back this isn't too much of a problem .  
1	  Simple is often best . This was allegedly a simple product , which I purchased to perform a simple task : play DVDs . It tends not to do that . Although it frequently ignores discs , and has a special affinity at not being able to play Disney products , especially the Studio Ghibli flicks they released and the Pie Rats of the Carob Bean trilogy , that 's not the most critical problem . For a while I noticed this problem on the special features on children 's films . Maybe a short film , maybe a fun activity for kids . You know , unrated material . Please enter password . The parental controls , however , are disabled . Please enter password . It doesn't accept the default . You know , on account of the parental controls being disabled . I 'm the parent - I 'm the parental control for my kids . I don't need a piece of poorly coded software determining what does or doesn't meet some programmer 's - or disc creator 's - idea of what is safe for my kids to watch . Especially when it is , you know , safe . Veggie Tales . Disney . Kids stuff . So I can use the password to set the parental controls , but even then , at the lowest but not off setting , it asks and refuses to acknowledge the password I set or the default password . So why am I writing this , long after I gave it a quick one star , moaned and complained to Philips Customer Disservice , picked apart the software bugs in their website that prevented me from reporting it on the first try , ripped them apart in a survey because they wanted to know how my experience using their website went , and figured that was more than enough time spent on such a useless , non-functioning product ? I was just attempting to watch a brand new DVD on some nice , relaxing qigong . You know , an exercise video . Which is , conveniently , not rated G , PG , PG-13 , R , or anything else . So .. I get the STOP hand . And then I try to go around that , and I get the non-functioning password prompt . At least with most of the DVDs I can skip the opening few seconds of the movie and get them to play , but because this brings the password problem in for the entire DVD , not the features , it 's useless . And no , it 's not the DVD . It 's running right now , attempting to help me relax , played on the PS2 . Philips , I promise you one thing : you may have invented the CD , and I will continue to buy things based on that technology , but never will I purchase another product with your name on it . You 've made a lifelong anti-Philips consumer out of me . Great job ! Well , to be fair , it does play some DVDs some of the time . Curiously enough , most of the time it hangs up , it 's on that FBI warning . Perhaps I could involve the FBI in this ? Maybe I should give the field office a call each time it stops ? It would probably be more productive than contacting the irresponsible , incompetent manufacturer . And , hey , maybe if I was lucky , they 'd raid Philips and convince them to update the code on the product so it , you know , plays DVDs .  
2	  These Selectors are a fantastic way to organize your DVD 's . We have over 300 DVD 's which would be next to impossible to store in their original holders .  
1	  This didn't work . The program I am using it for crashes when I select the COM port that this thing is emulating . It 's better just to buy the PCI card with serial ports on it .  
1	  After several days of intense side by side testing , under a variety of situations I can say , without a doubt , this router is slower than the Linksys BEFW1154 v4 model I was going to replace it with . What stunned me was download tests and page loads across a WIRED ethernet connection . Netgear WGT624 V3 was consistently 50 % slower loading pages after doing 40 + measurements on both routers . I can't wait to return it .  
2	  Awesome features , but don't buy the package with the " kit lens " . The XTi is not an " L-Series Quality " Digital SLR , but with Canon 's unlimited choice of superior lenses for the XTi , you will shoot like a pro before you know it . Buy the camera body and decide which lens works best for you . I chose to get the inexpensive , EF 50mm f / 1.8 II , for starters ( April 2007 ) . If you want a quality lens for under $ 100 , this is a must-have in your arsenal . Sure it has a plastic housing and doesn't look sophisticated , but the optics are the same as the much more expensive 50mm f / 1.4 lens ! My wife and I have taken over one thousand pix already with this camera & lens since April . We couldn't be happier with the versatility and quality that this camera is capable of producing ! Thanks Canon .  
2	  It does exactly what it needs to do - keeps the controller clean and easy to grip . Not sure why there are studs on the front of the palm-rests as they don't seem to do much , but I don't mind them . Can't beat this price .  
1	  The item arrived packed with a few air pillows to cushion it from side blows . However , if the lens was dropped anywhere along the way , there is nothing protecting it with Amazon 's method of packing lenses . To test the lens , I took 25 tripod shots of a few scenes with this lens and the EF-S 18-55 kit lens under the same conditions and apertures . Apertures ranged from f / 4.5 to f / 11 so as to compare with kit lens . Quality was very similar with the kit lens winning by a nose about 50 % of the time in both my and my wife 's judgment . A big letdown and certainly not worth the $ . I assume I got a bad copy from the good reviews elsewhere .  
2	  BEWARE - when I bought this , the vendor said they only had the Canon mount not the Minolta / Sony . However , the lens itself has a good combination of reach , wide angle , and wide aperture . There 's a bit of distortion at 24mm so I try to use it not quite zoomed out all the way , but zooming all the way out to 135mm is just fine by me - half the time that 's where I shoot it . Since I 've got the DSLR crop factor to deal with , it 's not as wide as I might want indoors , but I tend to shoot candid-style so I use the 135mm from across the room all the time . I wish I could buy a 24-105mm constant f2.8 lens ; I could maybe give up a few mm of telephoto for f2.8 but I don't want to go all the way down to 75 mm maximum . On the other hand , 24mm is barely enough for me indoors on the wide side so 28mm would not be wide enough . So this lens remains the best compromise for me , short of buying a 17-50mm f2.8 lens and an A700 so I can crop more .  
1	  PROS : Great format supportGreat battery lifeBig , bright screenGood build qualityCONS : Meager internal memoryAbysmal user InterfaceAverage " sound quality " JetAudio is terrible softwareTroubles reading . OGG tagsPoor accuracy / resolution touch screenREVIEW : This seems like it should be a great player . However , using it is disappointing at best and frustrating at , um , ALWAYS . The touch screen requires two hands and your eyes to navigate , so driving and walking become life and death trials . Having used an iPod touch , I think the fault lies more with Cowon 's interface than touch screens in abstract . In the interest of brevity , let me just say you should buy an iPod Classic if the best sound quality is your bag . I know the anti-Apple crowd are sharpening their knives , but hear me out : 1 - The best way to have a great sounding DAP is to have great source material . An 80GB hard drive allows you to encode at very high / lossless bit rates and still carry around huge collections . Sure , the D2 has an SD card slot , but at current prices you 'll double the purchase price of the Classic to acquire the D2 and 5 16GB SD Cards . Furthermore , the iTunes ALAC encoder is much faster than any FLAC encoder out there ; the same goes for the AAC encoder vs . LAME . And as for the vaunted sound quality advantage of Cowon players vs . Apple , it 's simply not true . All I will say is that it sounded roughly as good as my Sansa Clip , better than a 16GB Creative Zen ( the current one , it has NO OUTPUT STRENGTH ) , and as good as my iPod Classic I bought after returning this beast . Good files + good headphones = good sound .. OGG is better than AAC at any given bit rate , but the D2 can't read the tags right and botches track numbers . There goes that advantage . JetAudio is bloated , ugly software ( some might say " so is iTunes " but that 's another review ) . Using this player is like eating spaghetti with a spare tire . It 's no fun . Avoid at any price .  
2	  Junior may not be the best name for this head . While it is by no means BIG , it is not small and light weight either . I got the Bogen version for a really good price on here , and I have spent some time testing it out . It is very solid , holds like a rock , and for me , it stays out of my way while shooting . One of the reasons I chose it was the small adjustment knobs . I am a big guy , and getting up to my viewfinder with the handles of other models can be a bit tricky . This head solves that problem . Best thing about it though is when you lock it down it stays locked down until you choose to unlock it , unlike some other heads I have used . The one downside for me is the lack of a quick release , but I have already ordered an adapter to solve that issue .  
1	  I purchased two of these copiers at the same time . one works fine . The other has a paper jam sensor bad . Warranty work has to be brought in to the repair facility that is 39 miles away through heavy traffic . Or else I have to pay the freight to and from the facility . This seems wrong when it comes out of the box not working . Amazon 's warranty says it can be returned if the box is not opened . How can you check to see if it is working without opening the box ? I will most likley not buy from Amazon for any product that is a working piece of equipment . I will not recommend to anyone of my 1500 + clients to buy from Amazon .  
2	  First of all I bought the actual card as it was a gift for my husband but we have bought the online codes before and they 've worked out well for us . This is also a great place for me to buy points for my xbox because I can't buy them online from my actual xbox . My xbox is registered in Canada and I moved to the US and can't set up a credit card to my xbox now so buying point cards is the only way for me to add points to my xbox account .  
2	  Philips DVD players are my most favorite for two reasons , 1 . they are cheap and 2 . they can play DIVX and can be made region free gracefully . I am user of DVP642 for last one year and even though I enjoyed the flexibility of playing all sort of DVD / DivX files thru it , I never liked the picture quality / menu browsing much . Now , with this new model , menu browsing is much faster , discs loads way faster and not too mention picture quality also improved greatly . To add to my pleasure , there is a nice little USB port in front of the player , so for me , no more burning huge divx movies in CD 's / DVD 's . I just copy them in a USB thumbdrive and plug them in to my DVD player .. voila ! On a not so brighter side , the player does nto support DTS out of the box . But a quick upgrade of firmware fix that problem . Also , lack of S-Video out / Optical out can tick off some users . Overal , an excellent purchase for the price .  
1	  This so called car reader is completly defective . Before it , I used the " gray " version ( SimpleTech Bonzai USB 2.0 Mini-Drive , killed by the washing machine ) with excellent results . This " black " version ruins two new 1GB SD cards , including a 512MB long proven one ( used effectively with the " gray " version ) . Large files are corrupted , it is impossible to copy two or more files in a single operation ( by multiple copy and paste ) . I don't recommend this product .  
2	  Belkin always makes an excellent product . In striving to get an ethernet cable that is more than just a mere cable , Belkin provides a product that goes a bit beyond the norm and serves to satisfy .  
1	  all the effort you go through hooking up the serial cable to your computer is not worth the bad quality photos you 'll get from this camera . before you buy a digital cam think first - " what do I want to use the pictures for ? " . Go with a camera that has a flash and 640x480 resolution ..  
2	  I have had a lot of good reviews from people who have used Sangean products in the past , so I decided to go for a SG 622 . The radio is great and the broadcast reception both SW and FM from stations is terrific . BBC and Voice of America . I cannot afford cable news so a radio does well for my needs . I am here in ABU DHABI , UNITED ARAB EMIRATES , MIDDLE EAST . The cost here is around US$23 / = and is available in most shops . I think the price also makes a good and quality gift .  
2	  This is an awesome MP3 player for the individual that wants to use it to walk , listen to the radio , use while cleaning the house , etc . You can also put pics on it , but its WAY simple to use and load . User friendly and friendly for tired eyes :) I received one for Christmas , then bought one for hubby , my sister and brother in law . They all use and enjoy it . Excellent value for small investment !  
2	  This is a great thing to have for any sony device , especially that psp . it is super useful and , in the neon green color , a fun piece of hardware , not to mention hard to lose . I think that all sony device owners should have a piece of technology like this one .  
1	  No firmware upgrades yet available as of 3/19/05 . The expert that I chatted with on Linksys was a smug loser who asked me questions like , is it plugged in ? After answering his ridiculous questions and explaining the same thing 15 times he finally told me that I should get my router replaced .. sounds like the wrong advice , since many people have the same problems . I am guessing with a new unit I will have the same issues . Internet connection will drop out periodically . Until they recall it or update the firmware . Will a firmware upgrade fix the issue ? Maybe . When will it arrive ? I will probably be taking mine back . Might give AT & T one more attempt to keep me as a customer by calling their help line . But they may go the way of my former Lingo service .  
1	  My review will continue along the same vien as the rest : JUNK AFTER 90 DAYS ! Warning to potential buyers - there are power problems with this tv - the power light comes on for a nanosecond than fades and the TV does not work after several months . If don't mind losing $ 175 in Vegas , this tv is for you . I would not buy this TV / DVD combo .  
2	  Am happy with the performance of this router so far . Have not had any issues .  
2	  I manage the wlan at work and test numerous cards . The Cisco 350 series is what we rolled of company wide for for employee use . The Client software ( ACU ) included with the card is straight forward and provides great info on the current connection and link status . One thing you can do with this card that you can't with others is modify the transmit power for the card . The primary difference between the Cisco 340 and 350 series is the transmit power . On the 350 you can change this from 1mw to 100mw ( the 340 series peaks at 30mw ) . This feature is especially handy , especially when taking my laptop from work to home ( you just don't need 100mw of transmit power in a 1200 ft . apartment ) . The hardware is great ( Cisco acquired Aironet around 97 I think ) , the software is intuitive , and is fully compatible with many authentication methods other than wep ( i.e. , TLS , MD5 , EAP , LEAP ) . So why did I give this card a 4 star rating instead of 5 stars ? Three reasons : Client side software does not roam between discontiguous networks when using advanced authenticationClient side software does not include any kind of sniff feature to see what wireless networks are within range . I have to use third party software for that . Cisco cards do not do true rfmon passive packet acquisition . Cisco ( and I think Lucent ) diverged from the prism 2 chip , so i keep my Cisco card for work and keep a linksys wpc11 ( prism2 chipset ) for " network analysis " . Hope this helps . Peace to all wifi junkies out there .  
1	  I have purchased 2 of these cameras from kodak and The battery door cover cracked on both in the same exact spot . It is very difficult to use now . I duct tape it shut but it usually does not work . I would NEVER EVER buy from Kodak again .  
1	  This item was terrible the songs would sound very choppy , when you played the video the words would come way after the lips ended moving . I suggest you get something name brand for maybe 20 or thirty dollars more . Maybe a Samsung mp3 video player i bought one shortly after way way better .  
2	  I bought these to replace a pair of vibe earphones I previously purchased a while ago at Costco . That pair 's wiring had pulled out of the plug but this new design resolves that problem . The sound is clear and vibrant , the wires are sturdy and the cable manager is very handy . It comes with black and white earbuds in different sizes and I use the white one for the left side and the black for the right . The fit is great .  
1	  The camera is o . k . I purchased this camera because consumer reports gave it a good review . Every picture I have taken with the red eye reduction flash on everyone still has red eyes . I am very disappointed with this feature  
2	  This receiver definitely upconverts analog to HDMI - I have an TiVo Series II ( among other things ) connected to it via S-video - with only a single HDMI cable to the television . I am also sending sound to 3 zones - and getting great results ( Polk RTi speakers ) . Performance-wise , it is everything I hoped for when I bought it . It is a complicated unit - I used a professional installer . Additionally , the remote control is ridiculous - replace it with a Universal Remote . I never planned on using the remote that came with it , but rated it only 4 stars instead of 5 because of the remote and the level of complication involved in setting it up and understanding it .  
1	  One could argue the PIXMA line of printers are made for solely printing digital photos , and it does so exceptionally well . The colors are nice and the photos come out looking great . If you 're looking for a printer that prints just digital photos , then you 'd be happy with this one . If , however , you 're looking for a basic printer to print and scan documents ( emails , receipts , etc . ) , you 'll be sorely disappointed . The main issue here with the PIXMA MP500 is with the ink cartridges , and believe me there are plenty ! You have your typical CMYK colors plus an extra black for cartridge for black & white printing . Count them . There are five cartridges to purchase , and they 're not cheap . And they 're small cartridges ( except for one large black cartridge ) that go down so fast you 'll swear you 're changing out a cartridge or two once every 20 print jobs . It 's painfully obvious printer manufacturers are making their money from these expensive cartridges , and you will fork out a fortune to keep up with your printing needs . It gets worse . The PIXMA MP500 has some dumb , frustrating logic programmed inside it . If one of your color ( CMYK ) cartridges runs out , you won't be able to print black & white using your black cartridge ( remember , there are two blacks : one for B & W ; printing and one for Color printing ) . One would think as long as you 're not printing color , you should be able to print B & W ; , but the PIXMA MP500 is so smart it won't let you print anything unless all FIVE cartridges are full . It gets better : Not only can you not print if ANY OF THE FIVE cartridges are empty or reporting an error , but you cannot even scan documents ! That 's ridiculous ! Also , the printer is buggy . I have a near new magenta cartridge I just put in a couple weeks back , and the thing is sometimes reporting it as empty and the other times reporting it as being a duplicate color ! Ugh . That means until I replace that cartridge , I cannot use the PIXMA MP500 to print , copy or even scan ! THE BOTTOM LINE : I don't believe I 'll purchase another Canon PIXMA printer / scanner . I give this printer a very low two stars , because although it does a great job printing color photos , it 's too expensive to operate with its five pricey cartridges that run out of ink way too often . And when a cartridge runs out the printer / scanner is rendered useless because it won't operate until you replace the cartridge .  
2	  This tool kit has everything that you need , and it is so portable . I am really impressed with the quality !  
2	  This slices and shreds EVERYTHING , even the hardest food , in seconds with no whatsoever effort . I use it to shred any sort of veggie , including really hard stuff such as yam , which is so hard that I can barely cut with a knife .. it slices it so easily . Comes with 4 cones , thin slices , thick slices , zig-zag slices and shred . So easy to clean as all the parts in contact with food are removable . It is really safe , which is something really important for a tool this powerful . I could not find one single bad thing about it .  
1	  I bought this modem because there was a $ 30 manufacturer mail-in rebate and because so many on this website praised it . Here are the problems I found with this modem : 1 . When I send a fax using the Rapidcomm software included on the CDrom , after a few hours I find nothing works ; I cannot send another fax or even connect to the internet . errors " no dial tone " or " the port is already open " . Worse , I cannot kill the offending processes because they pop right back up . Tried switching off / on the modem . Not even a computer reboot would do it . I actually had to power down / up the computer to make it work . 2 . It would often disconnect me from the internet ( my ISP is MSN ) . 3 . The Internet update wizard meant to update the modem somehow cannot dial the 3Com server . So I went to the website usr . com to see if I could download upgrades but found the inf file for this modem is o . l . d . ! ( 1998 ) . I could not believe it . 4 . What is worst is when I called technical support ( case # 1728933 ) , I was on hold for one hour and hold your breath - there is no toll free number provided - it is a long distance call . 5 . The uninstaller does not remove all files eg . file ' usrwiz ' . So when you reinstall the Connections software , you have to know the specific file names to delete otherwise a reinstall will not work .  
2	  I mean its a cord that plugs in a cigarette lighter socket what else is there to say .  
2	  I have had this player for a couple of weeks , so I feel I 've used it and familiarized myself with the controls enough to write a review . This is my second MP3 player . I already own a CD based player made by IRiver that is excellent . I bought that player in 2002 and I have not had any problems whatsoever . By 2006 with the market saturated by the more portable hard drive and flash memory based players , I decided to make the switch to something more portable that could also hold a substantial amount of music . I 've always been of the line of thinking that it is a ridiculous thing to carry ones entire record collection with them . My collection however , is quite large . The 20-gigabyte hard drive the Zen Sleek Photo is equipped with was surprisingly a comfortable fit . I used to carry a CD wallet full of Data CDs formatted for my old player but now I 've transferred most of the songs on those discs to the Zen player . The portability of this player is one of its best features . It is small , light and well designed . All of the hard drive based MP3 players currently on the market are made for casual use , but it does seem that this player can stand up to constant use better than it 's counterpart the Ipod . The Zen 's controls are awkward at first , but it does not take long to get used to the vertical touchpad . The touchpad 's sensitivity can be modified by accessing the player options through the main menu . Once songs , albums and playlist have been loaded , it 's a breeze scrolling through the various names to access any song ( or group of songs ) that 's wanted . One of the drawbacks of it 's scaled down simplistic control system is the inability to make playlists , edit or change the order of songs directly from the player . If you want to make any revisions to track information or even change the sequence of a playlist , you must rely on the software that comes bundled . The software , while it 's easy to use , is a taxing application when it 's loaded onto a computer . If you have a newer system with a processor in the 1.5 to 2-gig category you should be fine . If you are like me however ( with a processor of less than 1 gig ) , then it can be a little sluggish . Running this program is similar to starting Musicmatch 's jukebox application . Once the program is running , navigating through it is simple . Even those who are novices to this type of technology will find a user friendly environment that makes it easy to access the content on the computer hard drive , load the player and put it to use . Another one of the player 's best features is it 's battery . This is the thing that is the most dramatic improvement compared to my last player . A 2 hour charge will last at least 12 hours ( it lists as 15-20 ) . When I put this in contrast with my other player 's 4 hour battery time it is significant because once I charge the new player , I generally don't have to charge it again until the next day . The feature that turns the backlight off when it is not in use probably contributes to the long battery life . File types also factor into the equation . MP3 's are the easiest to play , while WMA and WAV files are a little more demanding on the battery . The sound quality is superb . The player has an extensive EQ system that allows users to choose a preset ( ranging from hip hop to classical ) or customize their own settings . The smart sound feature will take all of the distortion out of songs encoded at high ranges and keeps the songs at a general levelness as far as loudness is concerned . This feature does affect the sound quality a little bit , but it can be side stepped almost entirely by turning the volume up a few notches . The headphones included are of average quality . The phones get the job done nicely and are a comfortable fit . I do wish that the padding that covers the ear buds were of a little more quality . I 'll probably be in need of new padding ( or new headphones ) in a month or two . The photo viewer shows crisp ( miniature ) replications of the photos loaded onto it . The quality drop when loaded onto the player is noticeable but not drastic . As a portable viewer , it is a good feature to have and it is the main reason for the player 's color display . The ability to partition a section of the hard drive for storage is also a useful tool . At the moment I just have 512 megabytes set aside to use for school work but you have the option of up to 16 gigabytes . Overall , the ZEN Sleek Photo is an excellent MP3 player , with great features ( microphone , FM radio , limited organizer , photo viewer , drive storage ) . It does have a few functionality issues but these don't warrant any great complaints and usually just require a tad more patience . I 've enjoyed using this player and I would recommend the Zen Sleek Photo to anyone looking to buy a quality player of this class .

2	  This is a great little player , but I bought it from amazon . com in January 2004 for $ 160 and now I can get it for $ 100 , but hey , that 's just how things work . Some people complain about the software and it 's ease of use ( or lack thereof ) I actually taught myself in about 20 minutes and I didn't know ANYTHING about MP3 players ( although I am experienced with computers ) . The sound out of the MP3 player , with the supplied headphones or any other decent pair , is AWESOME ! I haven't used the voice recorder , I have no use for it . The FM tuner is as good as it gets . By that I mean that all portable FM tuners aren't that great if you 're moving around just a little , but if you 're in the right spot and you have good reception there , it 's good , and the recorder is a nice feature as well . The battery door is a little hard to open , but not to bad . All in all this is a good unit and I would recommend it .  
1	  I looked forward to getting Energizer-branded batteries for my Nikon camera , so I bought three of these batteries . But , they aren't Energizer . They 're made by a company called Technuity and are licensed under the Energizer brand . After a few uses , they quickly died out either refusing to take a charge , or taking a charge but running dead within minutes of starting to use them . If you want a quality battery , find one made by Nikon .  
2	  I bought this to replace a Belkin Unit that burnt out in less than 2 years and my speeds are the same . If you need an inexpensive router that works than Linksys WRT54GS is a wise selection .  
1	  This item broke within the first 30 minutes I recieved it . I pulled out the cords to see first how long they were and how it worked and was used . So I pulled both sides out and it pressed the retract button to have the cords go back inside then it got stuck . I somehow mnaged to get them back in but when I used it later and had to pull them out then this time the cords didnt go back in . So now my retract button doesnt work and the cords are hanging out . But other than that the item works fine , Just have to be careful with the cords .  
1	  .. that stopped working after 48 hours . I set it aside for two minutes and when I picked it back up , the power was off with the lens extended ( bad ! ) . After changing the batteries a few times , fielding dumb questions / suggestions from supposedly-more-knowledgeable MEN , setting it aside for a day to let it " rest " , etc . , I opted to exchange the camera through Amazon 's 30-day policy . I just received the second camera , so we 'll see how this one works out . For now , I 'm giving this product 1 star , just because of the bad ( fluke ) experience I had with the original camera , that just happened to occur with my birthday present as I took my birthday vacation . ( Wonderful ! ) I 'm sure the rating will go up as I get more time with the second camera . * knock of wood *  
1	  I tried this unit with both the alkaline batteries and the companion charging cord ( which works fine ) and found the FM transmission to be so weak as to make the unit practically useless . I discovered that by pulling over , remaining stationary with my arms in a certain position that I was able to get " three star " audio levels , but that was it .  
1	  If you are looking for a driveway monitor , keep on looking for another brand besides GE . Mine averages a pair of C batteries every 3-4 weeks . When I contacted the manufacturer ( Jasco Products , which makes GE 's consumer electronics ) , they first suggested that some sort of interference - or just vibration from the wind - was causing the sensor to energize and run down the batteries . So I moved it to another location , this time sheltered from any wind . A couple weeks later , it suddenly began giving false alarms every 5-10 minutes . Another call to the manufacturer to complain about the false alarms and battery life , and the rep essentially said , " They all do that . " Funny thing is , my parents have another brand of driveway monitor in the same price range . While it does give false alarms from time to time , usually in very windy weather , their sensor is on its original batteries after about 4 years of use . At this point , I 'm trying to decide whether to toss the thing in the trash or invest $ 30 in a charger that works with C batteries , along with several rechargable batteries .  
1	  I bought this video card 6 months ago . It worked fine for 4 months . After that my computer used to restart automatically after 20 minutes of usage . I had a tough time figuring out the problem . The problem finally turned out to be this horrible video card . After I removed it from computer , it started working fine . I reinstalled it and updated the drivers and did all possible tricks but it does not work . I finally had to throw the product  
1	  We are on our second one of these the first one the DVD stopped working right after we got it and we returned it to the store . The second one has started doing the same thing within a few months . My grandson was so pleased when he got this and it is so cute in his room but at this point it is nothing more then a nik nak ! Disney should really take away their name from this product .  
2	  I just upgraded from my trusty 35mm to this digital camera . After researching for almost 2 weeks , I decided to buy this camera . It takes such sharp , crisp pics - even in low-light the pics have not been grainy . It 's easy to use - very user-friendly , especially for someone like me who has just bought their first digital camera . I am so glad this is the one I chose . The video is great and the sound is clear . I really like the fact that you can get rid of red-eyes on the LCD screen before you develop the pics .. there are so many great features - and for the price , you feel like you 've stolen the camera . :-) And Amazon delivered much earlier than the timeframe they gave me - 5 stars for them , too .  
1	  is too small for canon a620 , about 1 cm of the body of the camera stays outside of the case . So , save your money , buy another a little bigger . Nice quality , useless .  
2	  This is a great printer . I 've had mine for about 3 years . I 'm moving , so I 'm now selling it . I Googled it to see what the used prices are for it and tripped over this review page . The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I used it for graduate school , and I printed a lot . It had a tendency to jam up pretty often . However , I learned fast to ruffle the paper a bit and that stopped most of it . It still jams from time to time or takes two pieces of paper where it only ought to be taking one . However , it 's a great scanner . It 's also a great fax . I live abroad and , from time to time , I have to fax documents home to the States . This makes it easy . Also , having a copier at home is just convenient . Now I write for a national paper and do other freelance writing assignments . I also teach , so being able to take work home and work efficiently is great . Being able to scan , fax , copy and print at will from home makes what I do very easy . Basically , it 's affordable and makes things flow seamlessly . When I return home to the States I might even pick up a used version of the same printer . That 's how pleased I 've been with it . ( Reality kicking in .. when I get home , I 'll probably get the newest HP multifunction printer . )  
2	  They are a little bulky . It would be nice to have a retractable cord . Sound quality is good and isolation is great if you put the right earpiece on .  
1	  First of all , it took over 2 1/2 weeks for the item to arrive from Hong Kong . When it finally did , the packaging was half open . The cord itself was severely damaged , missing large sections of the rubber coating , which had exposed the actual wiring inside . Needless to say , the cord doesn't work and is complete junk .  
1	  My sister and I both want one of the Fur Real Friends , but we can't find them anywhere in our area . Mom and Dad where going to surprise me with one for my birthday in Decmeber , but told me there are none to be had . I 'm really mad because my real cat died last week and this would have been the replacement for my cat . So someone please tell me WHY there are none to be had , if you can ?  
2	  So probably the reason why you are reading the review for these exceptional speakers is one of the following : Rather high price compared to the Logitech products , Rather Simple Design , Lack of Subwoofer . I would like to say , Dont worry about it ! As a frequent music listener and who use my Laptop to stream movies a lot , I highly recommend these speakers for those who are looking for a basic , simple installation , taking up little room , has aesthetic beauty , and good sound quality speaker . Yes it is a little pricy , but these speakers with its design and its mediocre heaviness makes sure that Bose has brought something exceptional for your use . As an owner of the Bose Quiet Comfort series as I do frequent flying , I enjoy the sound quality that Bose has to offer . I do recognize that some may argue that Band & Olufsen ; and Sennheiser have a better sound quality .. but this is a simple laptop / desktop speaker we are talking about ! If you are looking for sound quality , I recommend the higher level speakers such as those recommened by the reviewers below . BUT , if you are looking for a speaker around $ 100US that perform well and fit firmly into your desk and possess easy portability compared to other speakers with same quality of sound , this is the answer . Enjoy listening . P.S. ALWAYS LOOK FOR " Amazon verified purchase link " under poster 's name ! Haters gonna hate =)  
1	  Every other cd on my spindle has had an error when writing to disc . Maybe I just got a defective pack , but my trashcan is now full of unusable cds . If you need 50 cds , buy the 100 pack so you 'll actually get them .  
1	  Stay away from these , get a higher quality cable . The BlueRigger High Speed HDMI Cable were fantastic , and only six bucks each . Or get the mediabridge ultra series for only ten dollars . Just stay away from this cheaply made junk .  
2	  I work in hot glass and have a ventilation system that sounds like a jet engine , plus the torch , a noisy concentrator for oxygen and my parrots are in the building also ( fumes ARE exhausted for all you pet lovers ) . The parrots love the noise and try to outdo it . My poor ears ! I tried working without the headphones and I just couldn't concentrate and my tension levels skyrocketed along with sore back and shoulders etc . I put these on with my little Sansa and listen to classical , soft pop / rock , gospel and radio shows and I LOVE LOVE LOVE them . I am relaxed when I am through torching . My ears do not hurt from wearing them for hours . If I ever take a transatlantic flight these will be my best friend on that journey . I recommend them highly . Lorraine ChandlerRed Bluff , Ca .  
1	  Well , here I sit , a day too late , reading 87 ( soon to be 88 ) bitter reviews of this contraption I 'm at loath to call a ' machine ' . I got this POS 8 months ago , and while pleased with all the nice features and the likes , it was annoying having to clean the printer heads constantly . I did not use the printer that often and for small projects at that . The scanner was nice and worked well . Recently , I had problems printing ( only a scattering of blue and yellow would show up on my page , fine if you 're just printing a low resolution picture of Big Bird and Cookie Monster ) , and even though the levels of ink were shown to be about 15 % , I figured maybe they were low and was at the root of all the problems . I shopped around and found that to replace the ink Im looking at over 100 of my Canadian dollars . I instead spent $ 50 at a refill store in the mall and walked away feeling satisfied at my savings . Anyway , things worked even worse than before I took out the cartriges and topped them up . A few head cleanings did nothing but use up HALF of the ink I just bought this morning with nothing to show for it aside from the sickly feeling you get when you realize you might have wasted money . I am absolutely disguested and annoyed , especially when I read ( after wasting money and effort ) all these comments that are EXACTLY the problems Ive had and continue having . It seems the printer nozzle things are jammed right up . I will be writing to Epson and hope for an exchange or some other similar action to save a customer . Currently , I wouldnt buy another Epson product for $ 2 . Shame on them for having such a low quality product on the shelf . Shame on me for not looking into matters sooner . Could have saved me some money :(  
1	  I agree with the recent reviews . Mysteriously , my printer stopped printing all of a sudden . It still scans and reads my media card . It will not print or run a self test . I contacted Epson and , after waiving the $ 9.95 fee to continue the phone call , they instructed me to clean the heads which did nothing but drain my cartiridges . I , too , went out and purchased all new cartridges . Still no improvement . I am in need of a new printer now and am tempted to buy another Epson only to get my money out of the new cartridges but I 'm sure I 'll buy a Lexmark instead . As a side note , before it quit , it did print beautifully .. photos and text .  
1	  I read many of the reviews with the general consensus being poor and bought it anyway because .. I wanted to protect the Nike + receiver and the connector on the nano . I didn't see any similar products that offered a design for the Nike + attachment . This fit ok but is much bigger then it needs to be . It is difficult to adjust . I can't adjust the volume and can't see the display . I don't really need to see the display but changing the volume would be a nice addition . Good news for me is that I left this in a hotel so I was forced to buy a replacement . This armband has been upgraded to one with a display but I went with a different manufacturer . The Sports armband from incase . This is a smaller armband but is more comfortable , it is easier to get on and off and I can see the diplay and adjust the volume . Run away from the Nike offering .  
1	  Kodak 8324154 KLIC-8000 Li-Ion Rechargeable Digital Camera BatteryHorrible : The batterys do NOT hold a charge . After @ 2 weeks in the camera , they lost all the charge . The same type batterys that came with my camera hold their charge for many months .  
2	  First off , I have the current shipping version consisting of Hardware Version B1 and Firmware 2.00 . From day one this thing has ran like a champ providing a constant 130Mbps connection to my laptop . The unit itself runs super cool and isn't even warm to the touch ( I imagine this is due to the new hardware version ) . My only complaint is the USB port doesn't work to allow me to connect to my Buffalo USB hard drive . I can see the drive but cannot access it . Hopefully a new version of the Shareport from DLink will correct this . I can honestly say I am glad I didn't wasted any more time with Netgear or Linksys who seem not to be able to make a decent residential router .  
2	  This item plays music from the ipod GREAT ! The sound quality is perfect , and up to CD standards . There are no problems in that department . The fact that it comes with a remote is also great , even if it is way to small . The main problem with this unit is the radio capabilities . The FM radio is overall bad quailty , with only a few stations coming in clear , the rest are fuzzy and horrible . Plus the suppsoed " antenna " ( which is merely a 3 foot piece of plastic coated wire ) does little to help . If you 're looking for something just to play music from your ipod I would reccommend a much cheaper product called an iBlast . If you want to play ipod music , with an alarm function an have a product with overall style and good looks , I 'd reccommend this product . However , if you actually want to hear the radio , I 'd buy an iHome or iBoom .. they are more expensive but work much better .  
2	  Product was delivered on time and no issues with the cable , it is working fine  
2	  This lens came in a box with a bubble-wrap . It had a gray filter on it instead of a lens-cap . It gave me err99 for the first few shots , which told me this lens wasn't used for a long time . After a few more shots and with my " secret " cleaning technic without opening the lens ( for the aperture ) the error message gone forever . Right now this lens is working perfectly with excellent results . Consider how much I paid ( $ 179 ) , I feel lucky :)  
1	  For something that was touted as being " international , " I was surprised to find out that it can only accept a maximum of 125 VAC , which would render it useless in other countries where the appliances are predominantly 220-240 VAC .  
2	  i had this for awhile and it serves me good still . i can fit 2 cameras in there , Nikon N80 and a manual Canon , with 2 lens . enough pockets to store few films and such and even a small p & s digicam . i dropped my bag few times and bumped it against few things while shooting in nyc but nothing happened to the cameras . strong bag . ONE downside is that , perhaps because i had so many things in the bag , that the top part of the cover ripped while i was carrying it by the handle . i just stapled it back . other than that , it 's really good .  
1	  I bought these in April after an extensive search for great sounding headphones . I used Sennheiser at my workplace , so I was eager to get these phones . The sound has been great , and they made my commute much nicer as l listened to my music on the bus . However , I noticed that the plastic coating the wire was no longer attached at the jack . I tried to remedy this with electric tape , and this worked fine .. until today . When I pressed play on my ipod , I was devastated to only hear sound from the right phone . I love the Sennheiser 's sound quality , however , these are not the most durable headphones . I used them everyday and I am not sure what would cause the coating to detach from the jack . Needless to say , I am very disappointed .  
1	  I usually don't review , because I 'm lazy . But I felt compelled to review this product as it is extremely frustrating . Sound quality is great , but for only a little while as they 'll soon break . I 've bought a few of these thinking that I 've just worn them out , but each one seems to lose their quality and break more quickly than the last . Go with something else .  
2	  I bought this to watch TV , so I don't have the auto-off problem . The overall built quality is decent except the really annoying background noise . To minimize the impact of it , you may have to change your position to find a right angle . Because it has no " cups " to cover your ears like many other headphones do , it is easy to fall and hurt your ears .  
1	  I got this for my daughter for Christmas . She opened the box . She loved it . Then she tried to get it to work . Then she asked me to try to get it to work . Then we called iRiver telephone support . Then we got an RMA and returned it for a new one . When we got the new one in the mail we opened the box . We were glad it came . Then we tried to get it to work . We found that we needed to phone iRiver telephone support . We did as they suggested . Then we had to phone iRiver telephone support again . We are very sad . If you want to listen to music on a portable device you may want to get something other than iRiver . On the other hand , the iRiver telephone support people were very understanding .  
2	  i just recieved the natural multimedia keyboard and it works quite well . the IntelliType Pro 2.2 software allows you to customize the top multimedia buttons allowing you to start up your favorite programs at a touch of a button . the buttons feel nice and solid . i dont like the soft feel ones because it is too sensitive and i keep on pressing keys that i don't intend to press . the keys feel like a Dell Quietkey keyboard ( its those white ones , not the stealth black ones which are Dell Enhanced Quitekeys ) . i like a little resistance in keys so i don't accidentally press keys . the right shift key however , was a little too hard to press so i just popped it out and added some grease and replaced it and now it works just fine . it also didn't take much time to learn how to type on this kind of keyboard than standard keyboards . in addition , like the main goal of this keyboard , i dont feel any more pain in my wrists ! the 6 key i don't really care about which side its on ( if you are such a good " typist " then you should be able to learn and get used to it ! ) ..  
2	  The DV4500 is hands down the best money I have ever spent ! It has been trouble free and easy to use . Recording video and taking pictures is a one touch operation , and I love being able to take my MP3 's with me without a separate player . Using it on Windows XP is also as simple . I can even transfer the pics and video to my Mac . I read the review from the Guest in Norfolk . I beg to differ . Aiptek does not need to USB 1.1 Drivers on XP ! Windows provides the drivers . You only need drivers for the webcam mode to work . Check out $U$ for some help if you need it . Thanks for another sensational gadget Aiptek !  
2	  I bought this for work audio recordings , and it works very well for a great price . Logitech quality and excellent product reviews makes it a great buy for a standard mic .  
1	  The case has room for only the GoFlex Satellite HD with no room for the accompanying cables , which defeats the purpose of a storage case , since we now have to keep things in 2 places . The mesh pocket on the inside , which I assume was designed to hold power and connector cables , was torn and essentially rendered useless .. moot point since this case has only enough real estate for either HD or cables . The only reason I got this is because the case from Seagate was sold out when I order the HD . Save yourself the disingenuous experience and avoid this offering .  
1	  I followed the directions and hooked it up in the correct order , MULTIPLE times , never could get it to see the keyboard or mouse and never would pass signal to the monitor . I tried hooking up to different computer and still the same problem .  
2	  Like some others , we wanted to get our 4-year-old daughter a camera to keep her from asking to use ours . Little did we know how much we would love her pictures ! She 's having a great time with it , has mastered all the controls / buttons , and has gotten some really great shots too . We haven't printed or downloaded any photos yet , but the picture quality wasn't terribly important to us . The camera runs on 4 AA batteries ( we 'll be getting rechargeable batteries for this ! ) and she inherited one of our smaller SD memory cards for her camera . Batteries & SD card are accessed with a screwdriver - a bit of a hassle , but part of the kid-proofing . Sound effects are fun , buttons & toggle easy to use , and the camera is a nice size for little hands . The only thing we don't like about the camera is the display . We 're accustomed to lining up a shot with the display screen on our camera , not the viewfinder . The display on the Kidizoom has a significant lag , you have to hold it very still for a few seconds until it catches up with the image in front of it . On the plus side , the two-window viewfinder on the Kidizoom is pretty cool . I 'd definitely recommend this camera for children ages 3-7 + !  
1	  This is not intended for publication . But it seemed a way to express my disatisfaction : Though , the listing said that this adapter would be the correct one for our model of Casio keyboard , it absolutely was not and cost us a rehearsal . We ordered another , the correct one , through Guitar Center .  
2	  If you 're looking for a good Universal Remote then this a good one to have . It has a number of programmable options . Sleek with a nice design .  
2	  I'n not certain what is going on here , but this cam should be priced $ 100-$125 USD . There are other sellers on Amazon that you can compare with , along with many other online marketplaces . Currently listed as $ 357.99 , this cam , sold by this seller , is unbeleivablely overpriced . Buyer beware !  
2	  This is a great product overall . Music sounds really good and it 's awesome to be able to charge the ipod at the same time . I 've been listening to some podcasts of people just talking and the static is much more noticeable . It 's a bit distracting at first , but you get used to it . I would recommend this product . Signal becomes somewhat weaker ( more static ) near bridges , overpasses and tunnels obviously .  
1	  I bought the Okidata used and that was a mistake . The Okidata that I bought couldn't be programed . Oki support stated it was defective . I was told to send out for repairs . Seller wouldn't refund the item eventhough nothing stated on add & # 34 ; As-Is & # 34 ; Next time I will buy new . My first bad experience on Amazon .  
2	  I bought this backpack for travel / vacation purposes . It worked out great ; the bag is not too small , and not too big . I was suprised how many lens and accessories I could jam in here . I put my Rebel XT w / Tamron 28-75mm lens . I also put 3 additional lens in the bag : Canon 28-135 IS , 17-55mm , and a 50mm . Oh , and a 430 flash ! That was all fitted in the bottom section only . You still have plenty of room up top , for accessories , CF card , lens cleaning kit , etc . Also , it came in handy as a shopping bag ! Of course , I didn't carry all lenses with me at all times , just the ones I was gonna use that day . The bag is very comfortable to wear , due to the fact that the shoulder pads were made of gel . All in all , it was a very balance backback , that was versatile , and looks great too . The only negative thing I have to say about this backpack , is that , if you want to get to your camera in an instant , forget it . You have to take of the bag , set it down somewhere , then unclip and unzipper it before you can get you camera out . Then again , your camera is very safe in here , and if you want fast access , get a sling backpack , or wear the camera around you neck !  
2	  This is by far the best laptop I have owned or used for reasons other reviewers have expressed . Normally I 'm just thinking functionality when I buy a computer , but I was influenced by the attractiveness of this Vaio . It is a pleasure to use in terms of functionality , but also because of how it feels and looks . However , I do have a couple of complaints about ergonomics . The two USB ports ( and three other ports ) are on the front of the right side , meaning that anything plugged into them ( including the connector for a wireless mouse ) is an obstacle in using a mouse , at least the way I use one with my laptop . The DVD drive opens on the left front side , which is an issue if you are a right handed disk inserter . A note on VISTA : try it before accepting other people 's negative opinions about it . There are some compatibility issues , but this isn't unusual for a relatively new operating system . I 've been using my Vaio for four months .  
2	  OMG , why did i wait so long , this is the most incredible and fun computer i have ever owned . you just plug it in and it works perfect , the screen is gorgeous , i dont see how i can ever go back to my PC . I love my 6 ipods and have been waiting to try a mac and finally took the plunge . My only regret is not doing it 3 years ago . If you are thinking about it , dont , you will love this machine . I would have gotten the 24 inch but they did not have it in stock . A totally amazing machine , that is also fun , and i dont have to worry about viruses . It even set up my home wireless system seamlessly and shared my itunes music from my pc just like that , i did not even have to click a button . most impressive  
1	  I purchased the keyboard just THREE MONTHS ago and the space bar is starting to malfunction . It either sticks and won't create a space or , as in the sentence above , sticks and creates too many spaces . This is with only average use . I have two other computers , an office desktop at work and a Toshiba NB205 . The keyboard on the Toshiba , comparatively , is excellent and has lasted well through two years of constant , vibrant use . Other keys on the Microsoft " product " also gummy now . Poorly " Mad e in China , " under the Microsoft label / gi mmick .  
2	  For the price of $ 40 , why not ? This lens fits my Nikon d90 well . Comparing this lens to the 18-105 mm Nikkor lens , this lens is actually smaller . I use it as a zoom lens . The only draw back to this lens is putting it on the d90 body . It 's backwards . Whenever I change my lens , I forget that I have to spin it backwards to snap it in . It 's not a big deal but I get what I paid for .  
1	  Too small to 16 inch arm . not a great quality and looks much better on the picture than in real life . Not really made especially for nano - it 's bigger than supposed to be .  
1	  i bought this machine it said it would read vcd 's and svcd 's jpg 's and mp3 's only on dvd blanks it would not read any iof the pre recordered cd-r 's or cd-rw 's i tryed every brand dont waste your money .  
1	  First one ear stopped working then the ear piece fell out of the headphone housing . This happened only after very light usage . For the price of these headphones I expected them to last longer than a month .  
2	  I recommend this product for canon holders especially 720 , u can record lots of movies with it  
2	  I recently purchased this ink as a replacement for my classroom printer . Works just the same for hp deskjet 940c as hp ink . I am more than thrilled to have found ink that does not break the bank and is afforable . Fast shipping and awesome quality . Will definitely be purchasing again . Highly recommended !  
1	  Our computer power supply died . My husband did a search and found this one which states it is compatible with Toshiba Satellite models P15 . WRONG ! The plug that inserts into the computer is not quite long enough to maintain contact and the output is not enough to keep the computer up & running . Long story short , we ordered a new battery , had the computer in the shop for about 3 weeks , and come to find out , we needed another correct power supply ! DO NOT purchase if you own a Toshiba !  
1	  Cynicism warning ! I consider printer manufacturers to be just this side of snake oil salesman in honor because of their continual efforts to screw you after you buy their printer with exorbitant costs for ink , etc . These labels are just one more exhibit in a long line of crimes by printer companies ! An analogy to illustrate my criticism and frustration with these rolls . In a bathroom , a toilet paper dispenser is screwed into the wall . When the toilet paper runs out , you remove the roll from the dispenser and you are set . Imagine your frustration if you had to replace the dispenser and the roll as a unit ! Well , guess what ! That is how these rolls are designed . The black plastic roll holder cannot be pulled apart for roll replacement ! Which means they can charge more , and they can try to rope you into buying only their rolls . I bought these rolls , and they work fine . I also bought just a roll without the holder from Eco-nomylabel that works very well .. [ .. ] Eco-nomylabel gives you help , listing 4 or 5 ways to work around the Brother dispenser that is inseparable from the roll . ( I cut the dispenser in two with a bandsaw , and I can replace just the roll now . ) Thumbs down to Brother for this scam .. Thumbs up to the quality of the labels ( to be fair ) ..  
1	  I bought this product at a major chain office supply store . Tried to install it but was unsuccessful . Reason being 2 of the 4 bolts that hold the monitor to the mount broke . Went to the local hardware store and bought more of the same bolts . Finally hung the monitor on the wall and the mount sagged . Tried to tighten the mount so the monitor would stay level . This time a major hex bolt broke . The product is made of inferior metal and is very difficult to be useful . I tried to contact the company who made this product since it comes with a 10 year warranty . The company is no longer in business . I would not buy again nor would I recommend to others .  
2	  If you were unable to get sharp pics with this camera , then you 've done something wrong . Pics are VERY sharp . I 'm formerly a professional photographer who has used some of the best cameras ever built . The Z1 is a CONSUMER camera packed with a lot of features for the money . Construction is fair and this is not a TOUGH unit like a Canon G3 or G5 . The lens is of very good quality at this price point and can deliver crisp images fully zoomed in . I 've zoomed in to 40X with the digital kicked in and gotten sharp images HANDHELD . But the truth is that even with image stabilization extreme zooming is hard to keep steady . The fellow who said you need 4 mp or more clearly knows little about cameras . You can crop fine at with a 3.2 , unless you have a printer that does posters ! Focus works great on manual settings as well , but the camera lacks a focus light which can give it some trouble . The Z1 can also shoot good quality video , above and beyond what most others can do . It has a great display , among the best I 've seen and is easily balanced . B & H ; sells them every day for 329.00 and it has utterly replaced my G5 for day to day shooting . It 's an amazing value . I 'm sure Minolta will come out with a better version soon .. and I 'll probably buy it !  
1	  I purchased this for a cross country road trip . Here are the cons and pros : Cons : 1 ) Doesn't work too well in cities . I lived in chicago , and when I used it there , many times the satellites couldn't locate me . I 'm guessing it 's because of the tall buildings in the loop . So I wouldn't recommend it for people in manhattan , either . 2 ) Now I live in Orange County , California . About 50 % of the time , it 's giving me wrong verbal directions , telling me to turn right / left .. I don't even . So I 'm getting off on the wrong exits when I should have stayed on the freeway . 3 ) A lot of times I get the feeling it 's giving me longer routes , just so I use the highways , rather than small roads . But the fact that I dont ' trust it anymore on California highways , I 'm constantly telling it to reroute . Pros : 1 ) Worked well in Ann Arbor , Michigan and Denver , Colorado . Overall , I 'm disappointed by how many times it 's given me wrong turns , but then again , Cali highways are complex . Anyhow , I 'd recommend try something else if you live in Cali .  
1	  Learned the hard way not to try to save $ by buying no-name replacements ! Sony battery charger does not even recognize the battery to indicate charge level nor indicates when fully charged . It is worth paying more for original replacemnet equipmemnt in my experience .  
2	  what can be said , this does what it says it will do .. period . bottom line , i only bght 3 , wish i had bght more , and will do when again on sale .  
1	  In a week and a half , both sides of these are blown . Not a quality product . Should be able to handle my mp3 player 's volume better than my $ 4 headphones , and even my $ 4 headphones arent blown yet !  
1	  Actually I expected more than 2hrs ' using time after full charge . But the usable time was about 1 hr 30 min . I do not want to recommend this product to other people . You can buy another battery with similar performance at much cheaper price .  
1	  I actually like the product , it works very well .. BUT it has major overheating issues ( my best guess ) . I get about an hour of operation from a cold start then it cuts out and I get the static / snow screen on my tv . If I let it cool for a couple hours I get another hour out of it . Maybe I just got a defective item .. I hope so , atleast I can return it and get another .  
2	  Easy to mount ( running the wires through the wall and under the house to the stereo inside was the hard part ) , and now I have music outside without having to turn it up super-loud inside . They sound great !  
1	  I purchased this as a radio boombox , but the fm is only pulling in one powerful radio station . My 40 year old 9 transistor pulls in 15 stations-go figure . AM works fine , speakers are loud enought , but on the flat side .  
1	  I was hoping to have a good quality , very portable digital camera to capture the precious moments of my babies ' early years . After 3 months it was dropped and I sent it in for repair ( covered under warranty ) and it was returned good as new . We 've used it a lot . Now I charge the battery , insert it into the camera , and the camera turns on for a second , then turns back off . Unresponsive . Dead . Tried new battery . Nothing . Repair costs more than what I paid . It was a great camera .. I was just hoping it would last more than 2 years .  
1	  Ordered it , took about 5 days to get to me , and it 's corrupted and cannot format itself and cannot put files on it .  
2	  We use thes to hold our DVD 's , it takes up much less space to put the movies in these cases then to have stacks of DVD containers on shelves .  
1	  The spec of this PSU looked quite good , but this particular item was dead on arrival ! So I can't say much more than that ! Return for credit went fine , so nothing to complain about other than some wasted time .  
1	  This book was incredibly long without needing the long drawn-out pages upon pages of desciption . I honestly think 100 pages could have been cut out without damaging the plot in any way . The title has nothing to do with the story and neither does the creepy doll head photo on the cover . I kept waiting for some chuckie-like character to be introduced to explain the hideous cover . Now I know why this book was in the bargain bin .  
1	  It was a pity when I tried it and didn't work . any Ipod or Iphone can't be charged with this device . The speeker doesn't work either , so you can't listen your Ipod music . The only thing working is the wire to conect with an external device , it 's the only way that the speekers work . The worst of all I can't give it back because I am abroad U.S.A and the charges would be more expensive than buying a new one . It was a bad transaction for me .  
2	  Works great , faster than the 4GB model . Keep the extension cord with you because it may be too fat to fit next to your other USB devices .  
2	  I liked these headphones . Sound is really good and clear . But as some people have already said , it 's a bit low volume . One more good thing is the cable is long . You can even lie down while listening to music or watching movies .  
2	  The Harmony 880 remote is the best ! It saves a lot of time with the push of one button to start everything . It only took about 15 minutes to get the remote set up . It 's sharp looking . I bought this for my husband for Christmas and we both love it !  
2	  Recently bought this unit as an upgrade . I really prefer a multi-disc changer with a random function , versus a single disc player , as a way to mix up some favorite discs . The audio is simply excellent . I am hearing all the detail I would expect in a high-end single disc player . I note very little noise from the unit as the discs change , and silence through the speakers as this occurs . As others have mentioned , check the dimensions on this one relative to your cabinet , because it 's a legit 17 " x 17 " .  
2	  I purchased this 5 disk changer when my old one went out . This one by far exceeds expectations . It will save your place on each disk . You can go back to any of them at any time . I would highly recommend this to serious movie watchers .  
2	  Thank goodness Philips was one of the first companies to trim the fat on the older vcr chasis box size standard . Also , commendations for including large heat vents on the side of this and other various Philips vcr models . After all , a large percentage of vcr equipment failing within the first 2 years or so is due to poor heat and air ventilation ; heat kills , end of story . This particular model makes one wonder if it 's even worth spending another ( $ ) or so for the S-VHS version ( not offered currently on Amazon . com ) . I 've compared both and found little difference unless you 're a heavy recorder . The S-VHS quality closely resembles the original recorded source but don't expect dvd calibre . On this regular hi-fi model there is a tad-bit of red color bleed ( look at objects or letters in red and notice the artifcat known as dot-crawl ) . Color bleed is when the electronics of any video medium , to certain degree in error , allow reds , some blues and greens to seep out of the objects ' or images ' edges causing a sort of smeared-edgy look . The audio hi-fi portion is very clear and dialogue is also very articulate . The hi-fi audio level is quite exceptional . I once owned a hi-end , reputable brand name vcr where the hi-fi audio was horrendous . It suffered from low sound level . The highs were lows and the bass had no " punch " . Dialogue was nothing but babble and the video always had a muddled and streaked look ( regardless of cleaning the heads or not ) . As for price , it 's almost average or acceptable when you compare buying a low-end dvd player for about ( $ ) . I would not spend more than ( $ ) for this vcr model . Also , previous reviewers who mentioned their previous / serious problems with this model , I too believe you . While this Philips model I purchased does not suffer ( yet ) from any problems , I have owned more expensive brand named vcrs and were shocked they did not last past 3-5 years under normal usage ( then , again what 's normal ) . In total sum , nothing more irritable and inconveninent than purchasing from a reputable brand name and having the unit fail you .. So far for me this has not been this case with this model ( and yes , I 've had it for quite some time ) ..  
1	  You look at the review stars and it doesn't look half bad , until you read them all and notice that the 5 star reviews are from people who haven't used the contract yet .. everyone that has , had nothing but bad experiences .. this convinced me NOT to buy the contract . BUYER BEWARE  
2	  Good tuner for me . Picks up all channels in the area and only one of those freezes occassionally but that could be the source . nice price  
2	  I use this to hold my Nikon D80 . I hike a lot and chose this bag because I can wear a full backpack and carry this bag at the same time . It allows me to have quick access to my camera and other lenses . It also works great off the trail it is not too bulky or flashy .  
2	  Pros : High and mid-range sounds from the cubes are very crisp , especially during gaming . System has a good all-round sound for the xbox 360 , dvds and for music but fall short of excellent . The cubes deliver an amazing sound volume for their size and look great on the top of the piano . Cons : Bose should make it clear that the bass module is not a powered sub-woofer . It does not deliver any where near the lows of a powered sub . This did not matter to me because I planned to add a sub anyway . Bass module is not all that easy to hide . Other Thoughts : I 've read many negative reviews about these ( positive as well ) . I would rate them an 8.5 to 9 on a scale of 10 . I played with these quite a while during set-up . Wiring , placement and amp quality are huge variables with this system . If the buyer expects subwoofer lows from the bass module , it won't happen . The bass module is not easily driven , a weak , low current amp won't adequately drive it . I replaced inferior speaker wire with high quality Monster Cable and it made a significant improvement . Lastly , the bass module provides PLENTY of ( non-sub ) bass when wired and placed correctly .  
2	  Great case , very durable and stylish . I would recommend to anyone looking for a long lasting product that works .  
2	  these do all they say they will do and more . blocked out 99 % of the backround noise on several recents flights i have taken . compared to 3 other pair on the same trip and they were far superior  
1	  Simply a failed product . When I received this product I could only get audio though one side . I tried multiply devices but to no avail . I had to contact the manufacturer , Sennheiser , and that was just pain in the ..  
2	  Mount secures well to the bike and the new battery door attaches firmly to the garmin . Works just as it should .  
2	  I love this radio . I have had others and none have been so easy to set and play . A little pricey , but worth it if it lasts . Easy to change stations , set the time to automatically turn the radio off . Just all around a good bathroom radio .  
1	  While there are many mouse designs that are specific to a right handed user , there is no indication in the marketing of this mouse that it was designed only for a right hand . Some websites for this product has the following line : " Recommendation : for all users " Not so , it is only for right handed users . For those that think this is no big deal , try using scissors designed for a left hand and try cutting something as simple as a piece of paper or a bag of potato chips . It is a big deal . Designing the product for a specific hand should be clearly noted ; certainly the photos could have indicated that design structure , yet , by my eye , it looks like it is ' a general two handed ' design . I would not have purchased this mouse if Macally had been more forthcoming in their marketing . Most mouse products that I reviewed stated clearly that is was right handed vs . an ambidextrous ( as most are , in my research ) design . I find the scroll wheel to be slow ( compared to , say , the Apple Mighty Mouse ) even when the setting is on ' one page ' which turned out to be faster that the ' faster ' setting . It is nice that there are two channels for the transmitter / receiver and it is a nice touch that an on / off switch is part of the design . It is nice that the receiver is also a battery charger . It would be nice if I could use it comfortably . My comments in no way reflect on distributors of this product ; they apply only to the manufacture Macally .  
1	  The reception is poor , the number of stations is small , and the ear-pieces aren't that comfortable . Might as well pay twice as much for a [ money ] no-skip CD-player , or [ money ] for a radio reciever that actually transmits .  
1	  I bought one of these from Tech Geek . This cam does not have infrared capabilities . The 6 LEDs are actually blindingly bright white lights . When I finally got a response from Kinamax , they say thet the cam will work in the dark . Well , so will my other one if I hook a flashlight to it . Ok cam for the money , but working in the dark and infrared are two different things . Drivers can be found at kinamax dot com  
2	  I bought this as a scratch and dent . It was fairly inexpensive , but I was worried it wouldn't work with the new digital changes coming up . Some feedback was that the instructions to install were difficult . Mine did not come with instructions , so I downloaded them off the web . I 'm am totally technically challenged , but I CAN READ ! I had it hooked up in about 10 minutes ( back and forth to the computer ) We 've had no problems with it , and if it doesn't work in 2009 , OH , WELL !  
2	  I love the iGo system . It really works great . This tip works great with my iPod classic , 1st generation iPhone ( before I sold it ) and now my current iPhone 3G wireless phone . I use it with the iGo home wall charger , car charger , and battery quick charger . It is a good system . Highly recommended !  
1	  The set up was easy , and the sound quality was decent . Then it just stopped working within 2 weeks . Went to the Logitech website , but was unable to find a trace that this product ever existed . It 's one thing that every product have a life cycle , it 's another to deny the very existence of a product . You can tell the difference if you look at Logitech 's website . What a shame .  
2	  I bought this Zen for my 11-year old daughter for Christmas , and she just loves it . The menu has been very easy to use . She learned how to manuever around the menu even before we entered anything on it . It is just the right size , works great , and has enough capability ( pics , music & video ) to keep her busy .  
2	  I was extremely happy with the Tamrac 5273 - holds everything I have and offers great protection . It is easy to carry and when you are able to stand in one place for a while and experiment it acts like a easy access protective tray for the different lenses and filters . My first camera only backpack and I am really liking it .  
1	  These things don't work . We have had them before and they were wonderful and did the job but these do nothing and we are out the money for 2 of them .  
1	  When you advertise a branded GE Cordless Phone Battery ( TL26400 ) - then that 's exactly what you should be shipping - not a JASCO 26400 - if you 're going to make substitutions then there should be a clearly worded caveat to that effect somewhere . I don't see one do you ? Might be a perfectly good product . Doesn't matter - this is dishonest !  
2	  I bought this 1GB memory kit for my Dell Dimension E310 . It was very easy to install and now my computer works better than before . If I have went with Dell 's memory , it would have cost me more than $ 100 plus shipping .  
2	  I am often hesitant to purchase 3rd-party parts for important equipment , wary of compatibility and reliability . But this battery performs well , holds a charge for a good long time . I will wait to see what it 's lifetime proves to be ..  
1	  Avoid Cannon . Build quality is horrendous . No good reason caused this camera quit working . I bought the Panasonic LX3 as a replacement and will avoid any and all Cannon products . I remember how popular the AE1 was and what a horrible camera it actually turned out to be so I should have known better .  
1	  We bought this antenna as a test to see if we could HD or any stations on a spare HD LCD tv . We live in the Boston area and there are HD and regular stations available . Followed the simple instructions and this thing didn't work at all .  
1	  The color printed is very vivid but a little off the true color . However , the prints often have streek lines at the borders that can not be fixed . The so-call " technical supports " which provide services over the phone ( sounded like someone contracted out from India ) is not very helpful in solving the problems either .  
1	  Does not work like it should . To much time trying to figure it out and then you get very minimal results .  
2	  I admit I am a novice for the most part when it comes to cameras , but this is something everyone should have ; Mainly for the case but also for the extra battery . I was climbing a wall in Florence to get a picture and dropped my Sony DSC-200 ( while it was in the carrying case ) from about 15 feet up and it came through without a scratch . Even if you are always carrying it around in a purse or bag , the padding around the carrying case is great to prevent scratches or damage . I know you can get carrying cases for less but the extra battery is great addition for anyone who is taking it on vacation or is worried about running out of battery power and is worth spending the extra money .  
1	  I purchased this system in Jan . 2002 . It is now Jun 2004 . The DVD player no longer works . Also the system always had an annoying habit of producing loud " pops " during DVD playback along with visual stutters . I will not buy from Daewoo again .  
2	  Let 's quickly move past the outrageous prices that your local store charges for an HDMI cable . ( The cheapest no-name one at my local Radio Shack was $ 30 . ) Making that comparison is not a fair fight . But given that this cable appears to have good build quality and works perfectly well connecting my 1080p laptop to my 1920x1200 external monitor , how much " should " it cost me , given the seller 's cost to make it , pay Amazon as its retail channel , and ship it to me ? $ 10 ? $ 12 ? $ 15 ? As of now , they are charging $ 2.09 with free shipping . That is dumbfounding . How can they not be losing money ? Whatever - I 'll take two , please , the one I actually need plus another to have as a virtually-free spare lying around .  
2	  Sandisk 4GB MicroSDHC ( MicroSD High Capacity ) Memory Card ( SDSDQ-4096-E11M , Retail Package ) Works great with my Sprint Mogul nothing to do but insert and add your favorite videos , pictures or music and very quick shipping thanks again  
1	  Avoid these headphones at all costs , especially if you would buy these to listen with while you work out . Mine lasted for about a month and a half before the cord started decomposing . The material used is very poor , the white turns yellow and then disintegrates just through normal use . If you are considering these for working out , don't buy them , they will not stay in your ears . That is assuming you sweat when you workout , these will slip out and just become more of an annoyance than anything .  
2	  The product was useful to me and less expensive . Both cartridges worked properly . I 'll look forward to buy this type of combo always .  
2	  It works great and also you service was great . Thanks a lot . Berta  
2	  Purchased for use in a small room which opens out to a larger area . The system performs admirably in " encapsulating " the experience and has enough power and quality to be used at lower volumes while still providing theater-like sound . Easy set-up , including volume balancing . Everything I was looking for , and priced nicely .  
2	  I 'm sure most people will agree that the earphones that come with the iPod are horrible . I have bought and returned 3 or 4 sets , and , for the money , the Sony MDR-EX51LP Fontopia Headphones are BY FAR the best . Not only is the price reasonable , the sound is amazing , they stay in my ears , and they don't hurt !  
1	  My interest in this product was only to provide a high quality stereo audio link between a TV and amplifier - distance of only 20 feet . I never looked at the video transmission capability but found the audio link unacceptable due to interference from both a wireless telephone ( 800Mhz ) system and wireless LAN ( 801.11g ) also operating in the house . I returned the unit for refund .  
2	  I always either use bouce flash or something on the flash and this one is small and simple enough to use . Direct flash is just not what I want .  
1	  This printer works well , was reviewed well online , and does exactly what it is supposed to . The problem is the software , it 's a NIGHTMARE . I always have to fight to get it to print . Either you let windows install the printer , or use the driver on the cd , and when you print you just get an error message , and have to reboot the computer to get it to print , OR you install all the unnecessary software made for servers , send it to print in the " paper port " program , then have to tell that program to print it . Either way if you buy this printer you can no longet in 1 quick step print your pages . Oh and by-the-way , I use windows XP Home so nothing outdated , but noticed it works a little better with XP Pro .  
2	  I 've always liked panasonic , I feel you cant go wrong . We just sold our 2 year old 5 disk dvd changer , we would of purchased the newer version but we wanted the HDMI which it did not have nor did it have the optical which I cannot understand , but anyways we are happy with the picture it looks much better than our old one and our old one looked great , but this one looks even better . I can't tell you how it compares to any other dvd player but I can tell you that you will not be disapointed . I hope this helps  
1	  If this worked , it would be great . Unfortunately , it doesn't . Even with the unit placed on top of the radio ( a high-end JVC - some reviewers have mentioned that reception was dependent on the quality of the FM receiver ) , it was still filled with static , and sounded cheap ( which admittedly , the iPod is ) . I don't know if it 's worth the postage to return it to Amazon . From all I 'm reading , it might work well if you 're in an uncrowded FM area ( but I wouldn't bet on it ) .  
1	  The item did not work in my location , so I returned it in it 's original package as per instructions . I hope that I get the credit back as I used my credit card to purchase it . I returned it last month .  
2	  I have a B.S. in Photography and have turned my nose up at most cameras in the less than 2 million pixel range . As the 2 megapixel camera prices have dropped , I started taking note . This one has an excellent price to performance ratio . I looked for a camera with High Quality , low cost , very simple to use , and flexible storage and transfer features . This camera has it all . I especially like to take pictures in natural light with the flash turned off , as it has an excellent meter and great color range . Sometimes it favors the flesh tones in the same way that Kodachrome did in the good old days . The USB transfer is EXCEPTIONAL , plug in the camera and with one touch it transfers and erases at the same time . Very fast transfer with 16 high quality ( one mb ) images transferring in about thirty seconds . I was used to a much slower transfer rate and this camera really makes it easy / fast to download from . The pictures speak for themselves if you have a decent printer , like an Epson with 1440 dpi quality , it makes excellent 8 x 10 inch prints . Hard to tell from film . A 16 mb smart card holds about 18 high quality pictures . Great overall !  
2	  I purchased a [ $ ] " Etherengine " card from a different vendor and had nothing but headaches . After spending hours and hours re-installing sofware and downloading patches for Windows 98SE , I finally gave up and bought the Microsoft card . Within 20 minutes I was up and running ! The software is fool-proof and the manual is easy to understand . This card is worth it 's money .  
2	  Product was received quickly and professionally wrapped . My family and I are absolutely , 100 % satisfied with this product . Works just as advertised which leads me to conclude that this provider is an honest and dependable seller . Strongly recommend .  
2	  SanDisk 4 GB Cruzer Titanium USB Flash Drive with U3Excellent Thumb Drive . But lose the U3 software - it does not always work well with some computers . I do enjoy the durability of the Drive !  
2	  I use Google Talk quite a lot with friends and family so I was looking for something affordable yet good quality to replace a cheap standing microphone I had . The Plantronics . Audio 450 headset fits all my requirements . It is light , stays clipped on to my ears and I don't have to bother with leaning in close to or holding the microphone any more . I highly recommend this to anyone on a budget who needs a headset just for basic chatting and video calls .  
1	  its says titanium but guess what i got BRONZE POS .. ik it is sturdy but .. so what i wanted titanium and they gave me bronze !  
2	  When I purchased this stereo as a gift for my wife , I was concerned by some reviewers distaste of its appearance . One even returned it because , though he said it sounded awesome , it looked too ugly to keep ! Shockingly , my wife loves the look of this old-school-style beast ! SO , now about the sound .. It can get LOUD ! The speakers are really great quality and can punch it out without sweating . Cannot find the distortion level because our ears bleed before we can get to it ! Some of the other components may last or may not . Disk tray seems flimsy , as well as cassette door . This seems typical of any stereo put out these days . Will not know about reliability until a few more months / years down the road . I would assume that something will go wrong with this stereo eventually . They don't make em like they used to in the 70 's folks . Overall , this stereo has some real kick to it . It might not look like the high-end stereos from the 70 's , but it sure can sound like one ! This stereo was the perfect choice for us .  
1	  Product was dead on arrival . Not only that but the door in the back is poorly designed . I imagine that the door would come off for good after having in my pocket after a week . Super flimsy .  
1	  When I bought the Harmony 880 remote , nearly a year ago , I was impressed by the fact that it could replicate all the controls for my varied audio-visual set-up . I was also lured by Harmony 's promise that , because the remote normally rests in a charging cradle , you 'll always know where it is . There have been over 600 reviews of this product carried on Amazon , and I don't need to repeat all the detailed complaints about it that have been registered . Before buying , though , I recommend strongly that you click on the " See all reviews " button on Amazon 's main page for the 880 , and then , when the review page comes up , you have it list the reviews according to " Lowest rating first . " My main complaints are discussed in more depth in those reviews , but for the record I 'll summarize the main ones here :( 1 ) CONTROLS : The remote is much too small for my hand ; the buttons are not only too small , but they are not well differentiated from the " frame " of the remote ( I wasn't able to try one out before buying it , but you should if you can ) ; even more challenging is the button layout . You would think that the main controls ( volume , channel , menu , etc . ) would be more prominent than the seldom used buttons on the remote , but unless you have a better sense of physical memory than I do , you 'll have to turn on the backlight each time you make a change and check to see that you are choosing the right function . My hope that I would become used to these short-comings over time proved not to be the case . ( 2 ) CHARGING CRADLE : As others have pointed out , this remote won't recharge unless it is precisely placed in the cradle , something harder to do than you would imagine . If you keep it on a small table next to your chair , it will beep and run its useless slide show every time you touch the table . ( 3 ) CONTROL OF COMPONENTS : About 90 percent of the time when I press the RADIO function key , my remote turns on the TV system , not the radio . I 've gone back many times to the ( deplorable ) Harmony owners ' site to reprogram the remote . After chasing through the various " menus " ( they hardly deserve the name ) for half an hour , I finally came to the biggest cop-out " help feature " I 've seen anywhere : the Troubleshooter 's advice was that " if you think you know how to fix this problem , go ahead and try . " Maybe the problem was caused by something I did wrong , but if so then why does it sometimes perform the correct function ? I have no doubt that some real electronic geniuses designed the intricate software for this remote . Too bad the other people in Harmony 's design process seem not to understand that such products are meant to be used by real human beings .  
1	  I was so disappointed with this printer 's performance that I finally just threw it out the window . I 've had it for a few months now and when it wants to work it does an okay job but about 50 % of the time it won't cancel or delete print jobs . When you restart your computer it decides to print the job you tried to delete the day before . It decides to go through an " alignment " process and print out a color sheet every time the ink cartridges are adjusted . If you decide to cancel the alignment it still prints fine but it tries aligning on its own anyway .  
2	  This little gem makes a super mini travel pod . I removed the entry level ball head and replaced it with a mid level ball head . I also installed a small hook on the bottom of the center post to hang a stuff sack with a stone in it to help steady the tripod . Using the above modifications I was able to use my Nikon D2H with relative safety . This is a real photography tool , not a toy .  
2	  I 've been using this cable for a year . It snaps into place just fine for me and has worked without problem , even after 2 moves .  
2	  I upgraded my Compaq Presario V5210US with a total of 512mb RAM , replacing the two 256mb units with a couple of these 1gb modules . The difference was immediately obvious . Start up has never taken less time & multiple internet pages , even streaming media , are no problem . My only complaint is that from the time I ordered until the time of shipment , the price on this & similar items fluctuated by the day . At one point , the Kingston model went from $ 12 more to $ 7 less than the Crucial I went with . That would have saved me $ 15 on my order !  
2	  Forget the $ 50 + cables at other electronics retailers and get these . Absolutely perfect cables , no issues , great picture ! I would definitely recommend these ! I use two of these cables in my current setup and love them ! Best $ 2 - $ 3 bucks I ever spent . Quit reading reviews of Monster Cables and other super pricey cables and get these .. NOW ! These easily saved me over $ 100 and you 'd never know the difference .  
2	  We are a new daycare and this has only been used a handfull of times so far , but it has been easy to use and works great !  
2	  I bought these to use in my 1999 Luxus LS400 . They work great , just like orginal equipment . And they are not $ 80 each !  
1	  The included IR Blaster does not work with the Motorola QIP-2500 STB . You can only record from the channel you are watching . This seems to be just fine and dandy with Hauppauge . Apparantly Hauppauge does not consider FIOS customers worthy of support and don't really want to hear from them . Haupauge support states that there is no working code . They also state that any resulting inconvenience is the fault of the customer for failing to verify that this " state of the art " device works with current technology . How foolish of me to assume it worked with a small , rinky dink , bit player like Verizon . Hauppauge does not have any support at all on their USA webpage . There is a UK page that has a good forum , but nobody over their has FIOS so there is really no support . Hauppage phone support consists of them arguing with you . Email support is non - existant . They just deny any problems or blame the customer . You cannot get past the stonewalling . Even leaving messages for the USA distribution companies owner doesn't work - they just don't call back . This is definitely a company you want to avoid .  
1	  Began great , decent quality and decent fit . First the plastic earbud covers fell off , and i used the extras . After losing the ones that fit comfortably , i order some replacements . About the same time , I noticed that the portion of the green earbud that connects to the ear would disconnect from the back piece . No a big issue , I could pop it back in and worked fine . The replacements stayed on but eventually the disconnect happened and the wires broke . Will not buy these again .  
1	  Destroy my 500GB hard disk . Cannot recognize a few 250GB hard disks . For the hard disk that it can recognize , the transfer rate is very slow . The Amazon picture is different from what I received . The one I received is made in China . I bought from [ .. ] the same Sabrent SBT-STDB in 2006 which has the same picture as on Amazon and it is made in Taiwan . It works like a charm with all my 250GB , 500GB and 1TB SATA hard disk . I order it despite others ' negative comments because I see the same picture as the one I have and have good experience with it . But I received a different product which is made in China and which not only does not work but destroyed my hard disk with all its data . Highly recommend not buying this product .  
2	  An excellent camera , good for close-ups . Takes a while to master the great variety of options , but it is worth the effort . And it is simple to just start using it . I prefer this version , which comes with a viewfinder in addition to the display panel , to the one with display panel only . Call me old-fashioned .  
1	  After fairly thorough and methodical experimentation , this product used together with a wrt54GL running Tomato firmware provided no increase in range or signal strength when used as a directional antenna .  
1	  Amazon lists this as better together with the Garmin C330 . It does not work with it and the Garmin C330 from amazon already comes with one . Completely worthless .  
1	  I have this book and Wagner 's book . Many of the designs are unusable for a wide variety of reasons . Plus you can get more info in an old issue of Speaker Builder magazine - check ebay or Audio Amateur Publications . More up-to-date and practical information can be found in audio forums . I have built ESLs and they are not that difficult or costly to build . Do a little research and add a good measure of common sense !  
2	  I am satisfied with the product and the shipping time was less than one week . Price good . No instructions of course . I have been happy with all of my purchases thru amazon .  
1	  The sound might be great if they could fit in my ear . If you have small ears do not get these . The buds are even larger than the buds that come with your ipods . Since the buds just barely fit the sound was tinny .  
1	  I tried to / make / it fit , but this sleeve was just too tight for my laptop - and the trying left me with several zipper scratches on the top of my poor baby .  
2	  The same ipod you all know , but still missing the FM radio . I like iTunes a lot too , but it makes a mess when you have . wma files  
2	  Being a minister in south Texas , I am often asked to officiate weddings out doors . That 's fine in a pastoral setting with a few people , but if you 're in a town square or city park gazebo battling background noise or if you have a crowd of over 100 people , I found myself having to talk louder than was comfortable quite often . At a recent wedding , it was rather hot outside and they had rented a couple of large fans to keep the air moving . I mentioned that it would be difficult to be heard over the roar of the fans . It turns out , the bride 's father works in the insurance field and gives benefits presentations to employee groups . He asked me if I had ever used a " voice saver " and when I told him , no , he quickly went to his car and got his for me to use during the ceremony . It truly saved the day . After the ceremony , I spoke to some of the people sitting in the back and they said they could hear me loud and clear , so of course , I immediately bought one for myself . I 've used it a couple of times since then with wonderful results . I used to teach in an adult education setting and one of these would have been great for that . This is a great device and very affordable for those instances when a little bit louder would be a whole lot better . It 's very compact and comfortable to use .  
2	  The design of this desktop set is excellent . The keyboard is compact and light , and the mouse feels good in the hand , and the symmetric shape makes the mouse for both righties and lefties . The USB receiver can be tucked into the mouse , which is another good design point . Maybe the batteries that came with the desktop are specially made , and they have lasted for a month already ( since this is my first wireless desktop set , i don't really know what the average battery life should be ) . However , it would be better if the keyboard were lighter . The " docking " of the mouse into the keyboard is a great idea , but the round bottom of the mouse makes it rather a challenge to dock it properly , and I have had so much trouble getting the two spurs " clicking " into the mouse properly . The keyboard and the mouse goes to sleep after a period of inactivities , which is good for the battery life ; however , they could take a while to wake up , which can be annoying if you are in a hurry . The USB receiver sticks out like a sore thumb , and I am always afraid that one of these days , my feet will snap it into half . The signal seems to be weak - I have to plug the receiver to the front USB port , and operate the KM within 30 - 40 degrees , no more than 7 feet away . The package boasts that no line-of-sight is required , but I am not convinced . My furniture arrangement may have something to do with it . Also , from time to time , key strokes would either repeat itself for several times , or missing . As other reviewers noted , it is not suitable for heavy-duty typing . I am only using it for my entertainment box , so the keyboard is rarely used .  
1	  Been looking for a decent replacement that would last . THIS IS NOT IT ! The seam between the base and the cloth started splitting within a week of using it . Save your money and look elsewhere .  
2	  Okay , so you have about 100 cds at home from which only some of their songs are your favorites . What if you are given the chance to combine all of them together in one electronic wonder ? I promise you will not stop playing with it . It has evertyhing you need and more ! You can even store notes and b-day reminders . The games included are also very fun . Check it out ! Its size and handsome looking features make its price well worth it !  
2	  Simply the best and easiest digital SLR camera I have used . I have just purchased one of these last week - an upgrade from the 300D - and I have to say that the speed and accuracy of the XTi is fantastic .  
1	  This is a useless product . When I first used it gave out a white foamy liquid . I tried using 2-3 times after that but same thing happened , thought selected a bad product so did not wish to return .  
2	  I just bought this for a camera for the kids to use . We have a Canon Rebel ( which I wont ' let them use ) and they use their ipods for photos and I was so tired of the low quality photos on the ipods , I decided we needed a second camera . I was tempted to get something with higher megapixels that was cute and pink and compact and I am SO glad I did my research and chose this one instead . The pictures have a great quality . The 10 zoom is fun to use . I will update as the kids have had more time to use it . The fact that the camera is now 10 years old and it still works so well really says something about the quality . Many of the reviews I have been reading about the newer compact , higher mp cameras are having issues where they stop working after a few months . I have also been comparing the pictures taken by the reviewers and the ones for this camera were really impressive . So if you are contemplating trying this camera , I say take a chance ! I found mine on CL for only $ 30 . What a steal .  
1	  This camera takes great pictures and is easy to understand and use . It has a MAJOR drawback though , and I may be returning this camera and buying a different one . The drawback .. It EATS batteries ! A set of Heavy Duty Alkalines will barely last 20 minutes ( even with the LCD display turned off . ) ! I bought two sets of 1200 MA rechargeable batteries from Radio Shack plus a quick charger ( $ 60 worth ) , and can barely get one set recharged before the other runs down . Don't count on being able to fill up your 8Meg flashcard AND download pictures on the same set of batteries ! A second NECESSITY is the AC Adapter . Without this accessory , battery life becomes even more of a problem . This should be a standard feature with this camera . We own a Toshiba and a Sony , and neither one of them consumes power like the Olympus .  
2	  I upgraded to this body from the D50 . I was torn between the D80 and the D200 , but after making the purchase , I have absolutley no regrets . The amount of control over settings , and easy use of controls is great ; though there was a learning curve . Pictures are BIG sharp , the 5fps is amazing , and it 's built like a tank .  
1	  I purchased the Toshiba DVD SD-3900 player and within 20 hours of play , the sound started fading then the picture went blank . I reset the unit by unplugging it and plugging it back again . Unfortunately , the unit was unable to play another DVD movie stating disc error . I tried the same DVD movie in other DVD players I have and the movie played just fine . My new Toshiba SD-3900 DVD player " Ran Out Of Gas Fast " . I returned the player for a full refund .. I 'm sure the company makes quality players however , I doubt it if I will purchase another Toshiba DVD player .  
1	  My stepdaughter had her mind made up that she needed to have this Barbie MP3 player for her happiness . I highly suspect that her stepsisters convinced her that this was the truth . After seeing one in person I couldn't really bring myself to spend over $ 50 on this cheap trinket . I tried to convince her that another MP3 player would be far more useful and durable , but of course that wasn't the point of this object , was it ? She had already ventured upon the virtual Barbie world online and this also influenced her choice / need . Upon opening would not function and had to send back after customer service determined the base must be faulty . This christmas present is still not replaced as of 1/20/2008 . I am hopeful for a positive result but what a hassle for junk . Mattel has been great about not adding any additional cost for me like shipping , but I did have to print the shipping label and spend time to have it repacked .  
1	  I bought this at a sports shop for about $ 9 . I then took it cross country skiing , so not a very rigorous activity . The radio couldn't stay on one station - rather , it would switch from station to station on its own , even ones that were just static . It does not do what it 's supposed to .  
2	  The unit paid for its ' self on my 1st two trips during my 1st thirty days . I turned around and gave one to my grandson who attends college out of state .  
1	  I purchased one of this company 's products and I have NEVER encountered worse customer service . The 800 number rings and rings and when it finally answers you are on hold forever . When you finally get through to the tech support department , there is an operator who takes a message under the guise that someone will actually return the call . When someone finally called me back ( after I repeatedly called them to check the status of the callback ) , the person could not have been in a bigger hurry to get me off the line . When I followed his instructions , my computer locked up and then he said he could'nt wait for me to fix my computer so he hung up . He actually hung up on me ! I could'nt believe it . When I called this company to find out the name of the President , the person answering the phone was reluctant to provide it . When I asked for the President 's e-mail address and address so that I could send a letter , this person refused to provide it and also hung up on me . If you are stupid enough to purchase this product after my experiences , all I can say is that you better know what the hell you are doing because Linksys certainly will not help you .  
2	  Save your money ! Something I learned a long time ago when working for a appliance store that also sold T.V. 's , cheap antennas work just as well as the fancy ones . I no longer could afford the cable company 's " Bundle " so to my surprise I found out by hooking up an antenna there 's a whole bunch of channels for FREE ! I 'm saving $ 115 a month and much happier .  
2	  This is great for the novice or one with slots to spare . However , just a thought , giveCables To Go - 28300 - DB9M Serial Add-A-Port Adapter with Bracket for Intel Motherboardsa look . Connects to your COM port on the motherboard , bet you didn't know you had one ( fits only one way ) , and removing the two screws from the bracket allows you to mount anywhere you want to transfer the two hole pattern to drill , or if shame is not an issue , just feed the ribbon to the outside of your case and let the connecting begin .  
2	  The product shipped on time and the product is just as good as advertised . The card is fairly fast and works very well on my A200 . The only negative point was the ship tracking ( USPS ) that was not available until the product was actually delivered ( when I didn't need it anymore ) .  
2	  The Kingston 2 BG Mini SD card is a quality product and it was sold at a very reasonable price . Mini-SD cards can be harder to find than regular SD cards or even the Micro-SD cards but this one was shipped super fast and has performed very well in our daughter 's well used Christmas HD Camcorder . I highly recommend this product from this seller .  
1	  Was excited to get this printer , set it up , it has a hardware failure in its WiFi access according to Lexmark support . Typical offshore tech support , everything takes longer as communication is more difficult , don't know state abbreviations used in addresses ( since I already provided a zip code you would think they could decode city and state without needing me to spell it slowly .. ) . Needed me to fax proof of purchase ( from earlier this week ! ) but could settle for forwarding copy of Amazon invoice . Hassle , hassle , hassle . Now I wait ..  
2	  I bought this CD-RW a month ago and I was quite fasinated at the ablilty of this writer . One thing for sure is that the burn-proof system is done so well that I am able to burn music CDs at * 12 , but there is no problem in the sound whatsoever . It 's a pretty good buy for such a writer at such a good price .  
1	  There is no way to program the keys . I bought this based on the advertising that said I could program the keys . They advertise that you can program the keys , but that is not true . The ability to program keys is only available in your game 's options menu . There is no inherent way to program the keys on this this key pad . The keys are locked to specific keys on the keyboard . Take heed . Otherwise the game pad works great . The " s " key 's odd shape sometimes makes backing up difficult though .  
2	  I took my MP3 player into the store with me to check out earbuds . Eveyone I tried was terrible ; so I ended up buying online . I read all the reviews , especially Amazon reviews ; because the people know what they are talking about . I have bought 5 pair altogether for friends , and they love these buds too . The music I listen to ranges from Tupac to Vivaldi , and everything in between . My MP3 player has 9 EQ settings ; I keep it on new age most of the time . The price is right , and the sound is the best . " Product Update 3/28/11 " Well my earbud died today , and I 'm going to order another pair of these totally sick Bling Blings . It 's even cheaper than when I first bought them . These earbuds are the best , nuf said ! PS they lasted 5 years  
2	  I am happy to finally get the adapter for my camera and at a reasonal price . I used it right away . It is hard to get Kodak digital camera asseccories in a store . Now I can do more with my camera .  
1	  I purchased this router for a relative of mine . I recently opened the package to find that I received a USED router . There were scratches on the top of the router and the " install the software first warning sticker " that normally is covering the ports was off and stuck to the inside of the product literature . Someone also had scribbled on the product literature with a black permanent marker . I am not happy about this . I expect more from Amazon and Linksys . I 'm guessing I received a return , refurb , or something along those lines . A new item does not look like this . This is the second time in a few months this has happened to me with a purchase coming directly from Amazon . The first issue was with a computer subwoofer from Logitech that had a large scuff mark on the top of it . My guess is someone was resting their shoes on it . It is very noticeable .  
2	  Does what it says it will do . I really can't measure if I had any improved performance by installing the extra memory . I just got my imac and it seem very fast out of the box , but because I want to install CS3 later and thought by having 2 gigs will help boost the performance somewhat .  
1	  I bought this product by reading some of the great features mentioned about this online . Also , I had earlier Dlink product which gave me little trouble but overall worked satisfactorily . But this product purchase is worst ever buy . This always gets disconnected and I have to reboot the router at least twice a day . I called the DLink company and their customer service is absolutely horrendous and junk . I called them thrice to get the problem resolved and those * holes just closed the call saying it is a problem with my internet service provider . If you are wise enough don't ignore my review and never try your luck against these Dlink products . It is just trash and I wasted my money on it .  
1	  While the drive itself appears to be fine , the cheap 28 gauge USB cable that ships with the unit is insufficient to properly power the device . I attached this unit to 3 types of laptops , 2 types of desktops and 2 types of servers and it did not work on any of them . When I replaced the cable with a Y-cable or a lower gauge cable , it works fine . The problem is that the device draws too much power from the USB hub and the cheap cable cannot handle it . Calls to Western Digital were met with " You can purchase an alternate cable . " That is ridiculous . The unit should ship with a suffiecient cable to power itself .  
2	  I have an HP Pavillion 5700 computer that started shutting itself off after running for only 10-15 minutes . It did this EVEN THOUGH it was plugged into a wall outlet and the power light indicator was green . I took the computer to a repair shop and they talked about over-heating mother boards , etc . , and offered a ~ $ 600 repair bill . On a lark , I decided to simply replace the battery . That solved the problem ! Now , the computer runs for hours . I guess that even when the computer is plugged into a wall outlet the power must pass through the battery , so if the battery is dead the computer still won't get power . Also , the indicator light obviously doesn't mean much . It is also work noting that the battery was about 1/4 the price here than directly from HP .  
2	  This device works great for downloading songs and pictures for safe keeping , but is too big for some mini camcorders , and mp3 players .  
2	  Reason for purchase : I wanted a solution to dealing with changing tracks on my ipod touch 2g while driving because it was too distracting dealing with the " slide to unlock " , etc . Setup Pros : I didn't need to look at directions . Strap the remote to steering wheel and plug the receiver into ipod . Setup cons : None . Audio Pros : Audio quality is unchanged as I 'm going from my ipod headphone jack to the car aux in . The RF receiver doesn't get in the way of the headphone jack at all , nor the cradle I use to hold my ipod in the car . Audio Cons : I 've noticed that sometimes sound doesn't output from the headphone jack if the audio cable is plugged into my ipod before the RF receiver , but if I unplug and plug the audio cable in again the sound is back . It seems odd that it happens , I 'm guessing it has to do with the way the ipod touch detects the receiver ? No big deal though , as I simply got in the habit of plugging the RF receiver into my ipod first , then plugging the audio cable into the ipod headphone jack second and I never have a problem , and since it doesn't take me any more time to do it one way or the other I don't see this as any inconvenience once I sorted out what was going on . Remote Pros : Easy to strap on and it stays in place on my steering wheel just fine , but I wonder if it might move around some on a smoother steering wheel ( haven't tested in other cars ) . Remote Cons : In the dark I can't tell which button is which so I sometimes push the wrong one . If there were a nub on the play / pause button so I could feel where center is that would be great , but it 's not the end of the world . I give a 4 out of 5 for ease of use because of that . Over all this is an almost perfect solution for what I wanted .  
1	  I loved this little , unit unit . I 'd like it to be louder , .. but WHen I bought it it seemed to be Well built , intelligent design . and I liked it so much , when it developed a problem ( Which I thought was my fault .. ) I went out and bought another one . . The problem was .. I was using it outdoors at art shows . I heard a serious static .. wondered if I damaged it soehow .. got it wet ? No , I don't think so .. but what could have happened ? THis problem , coupled with the fact that it didn't play very loud , seriously interfered with my plan . I got no where in inquiries . I bought another . It developed the same exact problem ! and the unit costs much more .. I do not recommend this unit any longer .  
2	  What a great deal , I 've been looking at this model for a year now . I was a little worried about spending so much over the internet . But WOW . I saved over $ 800.00 from what best buy was asking ( the same day ) . My new TV was delivered in less than 1 week . The colors are great , Blacks are Blacker than I 've ever seen . The ONLY con so far is that the sound is not all that good , but I matched it up with a new Sammy home theater .  
1	  The battery are getting hot after charged . It is not used often . Battery life is definitely short after 1.5yrs ( they claim this is NiMH ) . I bought Energizxx , more reliable and energy . Don't waste money in this .  
2	  Firstly I was a little annoyed of the color of this machine , it is a little lighter than it appears in the photos . But , I soon got over the initial reaction . It really is a pretty little thing . Extremely thin and light . I download and burn onto cd video files of various type and codecs . It has played everything that I have placed into it . A few things that could be improved .. The usb function works okay , the slideshow function is tediously slow though . The remote is rather cheap but I am able to use the one that came with my new tv instead ; ( Samsung HL-S4666W 46 " DLP HDTV , highly recommended ! ) Not used the hd upscaling function . But considering the price I would recommend this product .  
1	  broke 30 days after the warranty , and they don't stand behind their product surprise . how many of us in the real world can make something that last for 13 months and have a job . if it was a fluke it would have been fixed .  
1	  This router was not working when i received it . When i called Net Gear to see if they could help me set it up they told me it would cost $ 40 to configure it . Totally disappointed . TWO THUMBS DOWN !  
1	  This is an extremely poor product - especially considering the high cost . Every time we lose power ( electrical storm , etc ) , the unit stops working and it takes forever to get the connection back . I would not recommend this product at all .  
2	  We have used several different types and brands of these in the past . I did alot of research before I purchased this set and I read alot of reviews to compare all the sets out there on the market . This set is well worth your purchase and I think the best out there . We are using them for my son and my husband while hunting . After we purchased the first set , we purchased a second set so I can listen from home which is about 9 miles from where they are hunting . As all sets and brands state you have to have optimal conditions to get the milage range that they are rated for . My husband and son are in the mountains with lots of forest terrain and I can still hear their conversation 9 miles away !  
2	  I bought these speakers so I could listen to my XM radio in my garage . They plugged right in and work very well for me . Although they are low cost , they have very good sound . Excellent buy !  
2	  Just the best Christmas present . FABULOUS ! Picture perfect at a good price . Delivery prompt . Unpacked by shipper to see if damaged . Again good . Price great and no shipping charge and no taxes . Easy set up . No questions of manufacturer required . Just ready to go . Reset on standard color and not showroom vivid . Regards Dave Wise Florida  
2	  I use this camera on all my outdoor adventures so mud and water sometimes factor in . It 's a great camera however , it really needs a lens protection cover . Other than that , I do like it .  
2	  First , I have to say Amazon isnt lying when they say the price on this TV is a ' great deal ' considering I just bought this exact TV from [ store ] for about 400-500 dollars more . I went through all the Plasmas and LCD 's in [ store ] before deciding on this one . This TV was one of the best looking and one of the more unique ones in the store . The TV has a circular base which lets you move it as far right or left as you 'd like so no matter where you sit you can tilt it - But its so huge you probably wont need to .. You should definitely have this delivered considering the huge size and weight . Its 40 inches and its a widescreen . The TV is fairly easy to set up considering all the different features . It took me less than 10 minutes . You can connect a PC , a camcorder , and the standard things like DVD . It has everything . You can change screen sizes , freeze moving pictures , Daylight savings time , etc .. If youre looking for a very large TV with a good picture and reasonably priced then buy it . Try to buy it from Amazon and not the store because you get a better deal here . Overall , good value for the money and Highly Recommended .  
1	  Item was purchased as is w / no guarantee at a terrific price . Most of the time you do get what you paid for . Item arrived with broken lid and was inoperable . Some you win , some you lose .  
2	  This is low power , but works well at keeping a disused battery charged at 50-80 degrees F  
1	  Despite that Altec Lansing promotes that the IM9 is compatible with iPod Nano ; be advised that it does NOT fit the 2nd generation Nano model ( with the aluminum case ) . This misleading information left me wishing I could have given the product a zero rating because the omission made the product unfit for it 's intended and advertised purpose for me . It might be a great product but I was unable to judge it 's performance because I don't own an iPod the IM9 would accommodate . If like me , you have a 2nd gen . Nano , you 're out of luck . I 'm surprised to find only one review that mentions this incompatibility . I returned the IM9 to Amazon for credit .  
2	  The Garmin eTrex Legend CX had been highly recommended to me byfriends in a local prospecting club and the instructor at a map andnavigation course I recently completed . Those recommendations wereproven to be true , true , true when I purchased my own Legend CX andused it up here in the Colorado Rockies . I won't repeat all thepositives others have written about as I found them to be accurate . I have not found any negatives , yet . My wife loves it and says it 's easy to use and plot way-points , and we get a strong fix on satellites even out in the backwoodsunder heavy canopies of tall pines . I don't measure battery lifein hours as we take the Legend CX with us on prospecting trips thatlast several days and don't have to replace the batteries ( we don'tuse the CX as an entertainment center so battery life will varywith how you use the unit ) . We almost exclusively use way-pointsto plot our trips and trails so cannot talk about the coloredmaps other than they are clear and much easier to read than theblack and white maps I had on the training GPS unit used during mymap / nav course . Where we go the way-points are more practical thanmaps . This is a well-built , easy to operate GPS .  
1	  My MDC3500 was sitting on my desk one day , when I noticed it move . When I picked it up to see what had caused it to move the batteries fell out . The catch that holds the door closed had just broken off . It is now held shut with Scotch tape . Other then that the camera works fine .  
1	  The only good thing about this camera was that I didn't waste much money on an unused gift !  
1	  Samsung support is virtually useless , and this unit will still not play Dead Man 's Chest . Samsung says there will be a firmware update in a couple weeks . Up till now I 've always considered Samsung a very good company . This BD-P1200 fiasco has changed my mind . So BUYER BEWARE if you are considering a Samsung BD-P1200  
2	  These work as they say the only problem I have is that they occasionally fall off because they are not stick enough to stay on . that 's my only gripe .  
2	  I am a bit perplexed by the odd reviews this camcorder has gotten .. Personally , I am very happy with mine .. no real problems .. of course , I don't profess to be a geek ..  
1	  This may seem like a good value , but in reality it is simply works like one of those cameras you can get at a drug store but just to take digital photos ( and poor photos at that ) . The zoom is 1x or 2x and nothing in between and the LCD isn't a good representation of what you 're actually taking . I had to actually download photos onto my computer before I could see if the photo was any good . My suggestion is to go with something a little more higher priced . When the accessories easily add up to more than the actual unit , you have ask yourself if its really a value or cheap for a reason .  
2	  This mouse works great with my MacBook . It 's the perfect size and took 4 secs to get it up and running . I really like that the mouse is all plastic and does not have the rubber garbage that a lot of mice add nowadays ( that stuff ALWAYS ends up slipping off with a lot of use and it 's nasty ) . Logitech is the way to go ! ( Other BT mice I saw were running $ 79 plus )  
1	  I purchased the XM home docking kit and tuner under the impression I could use the tuner in a portable device as well as with my home stereo system . It turns out that most , if not all , of the portable devices out there already have a built in tuner and come with a home docking station . Therefore it only makes sense to purchase the home docking kit and tuner if you don't plan on buying a portable receiver . Luckily Amazon customer service is awesome and they are taking the device back . Thanks Amazon , great as always !  
1	  This is my second purchase of In-ear-headphones . I have a hearing problem and find buds more comfortable than the standard head phone but the soundwith these to me is close to nothing . The first ones are OK . I checked these against all the headphones I have and I suppose that is just the way theyare . Price was OK and that is about all . Reviews on Amazon were a little mixed on these .  
2	  This completes my 515 . No software to download . You just plug it in and it automatically adds the software to the Palm . The pictures are very sharp and presentable when they are uploaded to your pc .  
2	  I have a 15 " Macbook Pro , and I weary of how this was going to fit because of all the complaints in other reviews . Figured what he hell if I have to modify it I would . But didn't have to do a thing besides snap it on , the screen tilts back just barely less than without it , but it is negligible . Very satisfied with fitment , and it will protect my computer which was the main reason I purchased it . The only thing that worries me is heat being trapped on the underside , it will be about as bad as having lay flat on a table . It is easy to remove the casing if need be . anways great product , perfect fit , protects , and looks awsome .  
1	  My Infinity BU-120 sub-woofer is dead . The amplifier S53AMI blew and from what I have been able to learn on the web this is not an uncommon problem . Infinity can't help me since the company that manufactures the S53AMI is no longer in business . I hope Infinity has learned a good lesson but I 'm not going to buy from them or their parent company Harmon Kardon to find out .  
2	  I use three of these in my digital cameras for both still images and video . They never fail to perform flawlessly ! Trust Transcend !  
1	  This company discontinued their support for their older , but recent , products , rather than offer drivers for 64 bit systems . They do not stand behind what they sell .. no matter how good a product is , if support dries up , it becomes so much useless junk in a hurry .  
2	  Awesome price first of all . I have shopped at every store in my area that sells electronics and I have seen shorter cords that run $ 20 or even $ 30 so finding a long one at this price was awesome .  
1	  This card would not work in my computer . I was running windows XP and it worked for a few minutes , thenit gave me the blue screen of death . I had to remove it .  
2	  I received the case yesterday and took it on a hike in pretty heavy woods today . I got fine reception . And you can manipulate the controls OK . Screen covered by plastic to protect but that was not a problem . FYI - I ordered from Amazon and used their free shipping option . They bluffed and said 7 to 9 days . I said OK . I actually recieved the order by UPS in 23 , yes 23 hours , after placing order !  
1	  Maybe because I am using comcast Blast ! and IPV6 , the router cannot tolerate my speed ! I think the router is quite broken , it get rebooted automatically after days , maybe because the heat when the cpu was busy . I then bought another router more than $ 100 , it was quite good . So I think I don't suggest buying DIR615  
2	  I bought this camera over a year ago and I have been nothing but pleased . I 've never had any problems with its function . It produces some amazing pictures . I 've never so much as noticed the battery getting the slightest bit low . I like it so much that I 'm shopping for another Exilim to give as a gift right now .  
2	  Great little camera . This is my third digital camera and my first Canon digital . The image stabilization feature is what sold it for us . We purchased this as a replacement for our stolen Sony DCP-100 . We liked that camera a lot and looked to Sony for a replacement . But after reading reviews and handling the Sony 's we weren't impressed at all . In looking back at the photos we had taken with the Sony we realized how many of them were blurry . So we went with the Canon as it was one of the only cameras in our price range that had Image Stabilization . We have already noticed a difference in our picture quality . IS is an excellent feature for a camera this small as the slightest movement of your hands passes directly to the camera . Battery life seems good so far but we haven't really stressed it yet . All of the hatches for the various compartments seem a little too delicate for my liking , but I thought the same thing about the Sony and it never failed . I don't like the fact that I have to remove the battery from the camera to charge it . thats a lot of moving seemingly delicate parts just to charge the battery . Why can't it charge through the USB cable ? The other issue I have with the camera is the finish of the front of the camera . It is VERY delicate and scratches VERY easily . I suggest buying a case for this camera ASAP . I delayed purchasing a case and now have scratches on mine . Our previous Sony had scratches too but only after two years of use and still weren't as noticeable as these after just two days . Overall we are very happy with this camera . The menu is easy to use and set up for your preferences . The big 2.5 " screen is bright and works well even in bright sunshine . The buttons have a very solid quality feel . It takes better pictures than the Sony it replaced and we were very happy with that . The macro mode could be better as it doesn't allow me to get as close to a subject as I would like but that inst a deal killer as I don't shoot that many macro images . Overall a great point and shoot camera that anyone should be happy with .. from first timers to professionals just looking for a pocket point and shoot to carry around . But then again it should be for $ 400 . There are better values in this category ( i.e. Panasonic ) but this one had the best mix of features and quality for our needs and wants . PROS : Small sizeImage StabilizationLCD displayFast start up and easy to useCONS : Delicate hatch coversMust remove battery to chargeDelicate front surface finish scratches easily  
1	  DONT EVEN THINK TO BUY THIS . ITS probably 20 times or even 30 times bigger than your ipod .  
2	  Flawless picture and sound , no problems at all . If you need an HDMI cable go ahead and get this one , you wonr be disappointed .  
1	  I bought this product twice and the same thing happen . - Dont last long - One side stop workingDon't recommend them at all  
2	  Very nice product , everthing works well and the itens is just the same as in the photo . I 'm very happy with the product and with the seller .  
2	  I was thinking between the Rebel XT and 20d . I didn't like the plastic body of the Rebel XT . Also the XT size is like miniature SLR or a crossbred between point-n-shoot and SLR , it just didn't right in my hand . But , the 20D fits like the gloves in my hands . The 20d is a litle bigger than XT . It 's metal is rock solid . I like to travel and take a lot of pictures of people . I thought if I have to take pictures , people will notice me of my shootings , I might as well carry the best camera that I could afford which is the 20d . I just bought mine about 3 weeks ago and I 've been taking more than 3000 pictures . I use Canon EF 28-135mm f / 3.5-5.6 IS USM len ( Made in Japan len ) . The IS ( Image Stabilization ) feature of the len is a must . Most of the my pics are very sharp . I 'm still playing around with this camera . Some of my pics are blurred because I used third party flash Metz Mecablitz 45 CL-4 , and it did not synch correctly for right amount of flash needed . I shot mostly in automatic ( P mode ) TTL flash . Since I 've spent a good amount of money on the camera already , I thought I might as well invest in a good flash . I just ordered through Amazon ( which prices are very competitive to Beach or Adorama , B & H ;) the Canon 580EX flash . I hope this flash will do the trick . To sum up , so far so good . Very happy with my Canon 20d . The battery that comes with is amazing ! I took more than 1000 pictures before I realized I need to recharged , just in case . Also the full recharge of the battery takes less than 2 hours . I plan to get the Canon BGE2 Battery Grip and extra battery set . It 's not that I really need it , but I just like the beefed-up look of this camera and made me look like a pro . I 'm glad I picked this one over the Rebel XT-I don't think the XT would have the extension of the battery Grip like the 20D.One more thing . Amazon . com reviews influenced me to buy this camera . I 'm very happy with prices and services which makes Amazon my one stop shopping and reading reviews on books and all electronic gadgets .  
1	  I have had this camera for six weeks . It works when hardwired . I have had several emails from Ly Seang , the company trouble shooter . His replies are short , not specifically responsive to my clearly stated issues AND his replies have not helped . I have learned that this product cannot be managed except on some XP machines and it cannot be viewed except by Internet Explorer on some machines set up with restrictions . Therefore it is NOT a true IP Camera . I would have given it NO STARS if that had been an option .  
1	  did not work with my ipod . had to go to best buy and spend $ 20.00 for one . will not try cheap parts again .  
1	  I bet some people do buy this for $ 60 more than the newer , better 5.5 generation ipod . Why does amazon feature this product when it 's obviously a rip-off ?  
2	  I purchased this item initially because of the price , compared to the IPOD 's . I LOVE it ! My husband has the video IPOD and his battery needs charged every day . I have never had to charge this MP3 player yet ! It goes for 50 hours - I ordered the mini sony speakers for it so I can listen to it at work on my desk or anywhere . The only downside is that Sony quit making the armband for it so I am having a hard time finding a holder for it . It fit my needs perfectly -  
2	  worked great right out the box . love the touch screen . the voice commands are on time and clear . if you miss a turn it recalculates quickly . the only down side was that it does not come with a usb cable or wall charger .  
2	  Having owned multiple D-Link DI-624 's and wirless access cards ; gave them all to family members who needed wifi . I did test out and compare this to a Linksys WRT610N , but won't post the speed tests . Others have already done so . Linksys has the edge in raw speed , but I found this D-Link DIR-655 to be a better value , and easier to use . It 's also less power hungry than the Linksys . My unit is h / w version A4 , and runs cool to the touch under load . I have it wall mounted in my basement , but have no dead spots throughout my house . Green technology powers down ethernet ports when not in use . You can configure wireless to power down on a schedule too . I didn't need the included CD to set this up at all . CD and website include a pdf manual - but we never RTFM ! Set up static ip for my wifi HP printer . Gave my Ooma voip hub preferential treatment in QoS . Set up a workgroup so my DirecTV dvr can access the Public folder on my computers , and my NAS drive . Set up a separate guest wifi for visitors so they could access the Net , but not my protected network nor storage drive . Pros : - 802.11n fully compliant firmware vers 1.21 and up - fast , reliable , super customizable - setup via wizards is super easy ; despite feature complexity , manual setup is not difficult either - runs very cool - ability to swap out antennas , manipulate for best reception ( unlike Linksys WRT610N ) - " Shareport " allows you to setup USB drive as a NAS - configurable QoS - works great with my XP , Vista , and Windows7 machines in all modesincluding G-only , mixed mode , and N-only . Slight Negatives : - not dual band , but so what ? Have no less than 14 neighboring wifi networks , their cordless phones , but NO interference or reception issues .  
2	  You get more than you pay for . Yes , the Tamron AF 18-200 is not the best all around lens out there , but for less than $ 200 , you get a very good lens , that can be used for pretty much any situation . Perfect fit for my Canon T3i and also ships with a lens hood . Taking very nice pictures thus far and will get the majority of my time , with using my T3i .  
1	  The player itself was on the thicker side , but with this case on , it made it just rediculous . on top of that , the case was loose and din't fit right , and it made things look kind of ugly , and i couldn't take it . i took it off five minutes after i put it on . I hated it . I couldn't figure out how to put the belt clip on , and there were no instructions to tell me how .  
2	  After I read some reviews on this site I was kind of scared to buy the product . I live in NYC and would be doing a lot of walking and what not with it and skipping would be a big problem . I bought it anyway and am definately not sorry . I walk all over New York and up and down the subway and it has never skipped once i don't even have the ESP on . I keep the player vertical in my jacket pocket and walk freely with it even if it is jarred it won't skip . I updated to firmware version 1.12 and really enjoy the new features such as directory hierarchy and resume . It has always read every file i have put on disc and has read every id3 tag . I am VERY VERY happy with this product and am looking at buying one for my spouse as well . Buy this and you won't be sorry .  
1	  I bought this product because on the discription it says for ipod Nano second generation , but when i got it it was abvious that it wasn't ! .. its only made for the first generation nano , so becareful and don't waste 12 bucks like i did .  
1	  I would rate this ZERO stars if possible . We got this free as well from an IBook purchase , and since it worked with the Airport express , seemed like a good solution . It literally worked for TWO DAYS PAST THE WARRANTY date , if you can believe that ! Like all the others on this post , I purchased MULTIPLE sets of ink thinking it was the ink itself . Tech support advised to clean the heads-no help . I think I 've tried that procedure about 100 times so far , to no avail . After spending about 200 bucks in ink packages , the only color that prints is blue . Nothing else . Do not waste the money on this . Even if it is free , it is a huge waste of money because it runs out of ink so quickly-in the year it DID work , I think I replaced the ink about eight times entirely . Really bad piece of equipment .  
2	  I like the earbuds so much that I replace my previous original IPOD earbuds . Its pink color bright up my spirit easily . Sound quality is decent too . Two cons : 1 . the silcon parts sometimes fall off , tough to find them . 2 . after half a year since I used it , one earbud does not sound any more . :(  
2	  I was enough impressed about these earbuds that I bought another set for a friend . I know some people cannot stand the feel of an in-ear earphone , but , if you can , this product will certainly please you . It comes with three sets of seals - small , medium , and large - and with the correct seal , the sound response is amazing ( there IS bass lurking in your iPod ! ) whether you are programming in front of a computer in a noisy office or just flying in an MD-80 . Here is what I compare these to : the original Apple on-ear set never sat on my ear properly and never gave me the bass response I wanted ; Panasonic on-ear headphones with noise cancelation at close to the same price ( which seem almost as good as the much more expensive BOSE QC-3 but much better than my old cheaper noise-canceling SONY 's ) get rid of more noise and give a little better bass than these but will not fit in your shirt pocket next to your iPod . I never did try the $ 300 to $ 400 sets , and I don't think I need to .  
2	  Best SD card I have ever owned . Significantly faster then several other so called " high Speed " cards I have tried . You get 4GB of capacity for less than $ 40 . A great value !  
1	  Sangean radio . So far I like it very much . The sound quality is excellent , as is the base enhancement feature . I 'm learning slowly to set the memory function . So far , so good ! I tend to be technologically challenged , but am persistent ! Frances VandervoortChicago  
2	  Very happy with rhis sub . I searched around to find this one and im glad i did .. it pounds !  
1	  Does not work with my Canon i960 , despite hours of configuration attempts . Following the instructions Tech Support emailed me three days after I reported the problem did not work . The Tech Support number provides access to a perpetual busy signal . Why won't Hawking Technologies simply publish the list of compatible printers ?  
2	  Before purchasing this camera , I read and studied reviews and product descriptions . I have had it about 3 weeks and I love it . I haven't spent much time learning all the features , just figure them out when the need arises . I have made some great photos without really reading the manual . These include a lot of indoor shots made without flash . Pluses : ease of use , rotating lcd , inexpensive batteries , andgreat photos .  
1	  If you 're the kind of user who can always carry the ( included ) carrying case , then my comment will be irrelevant ; enjoy the earphones , as they 're as good as EX71 . However , I usually keep my earphones wrapped around my iPod , and unless you are super careful , the over-the ear hooks make it susceptible to tangles . The same hooks also make it cumbersome to untangle . Also , the hooks make it a bit annoying to use the earphones while I use my sunglasses or my eyeglasses . It 's doable , but it tends to push the earphones out of my ears . Finally , the white color goes well with the white iPod models , but after a few months , they tend to show the grime all too well . My advice : I don't think that any ( claimed ) audio improvement over EX-71 is worth the extra hassle . If your heart is set on this model , get the black one .  
2	  Head phones are good , sound is a little lite , but the fit is what I was looking for . Very fast shipper too .. Behind the head , comfortable and easy to use . Recommend this buyer  
1	  The keyboard lags terribley . It will barely work if you have it too close to the wireless reciever . The Mouse lags terribley . You absolutely cannot play computer games with this or you will want to break your computer . Maybe I just got a bad one though .. other than that , everything else is fine .  
1	  As many camcorder fans , I was excited by the Canon Press Release about Canon Optura 40 Camcorder , pre ordered it and received it late May . After opening the box , the camera looks great : compact , slick , nice looking lens . However , after a couple of time trial shootings , all these nice impressions were gone for good ! A few Major disappointments : 1 ) Poor video image . The video image has too much " digital " jaggies both in regular daylight and lower light environment shooting . When you play back on the TV , you see the " fluttery " effect all the time . When you pause the image , the jaggies are very obvious and horrible . This is even worse when you shoot in the low light environment . 2 ) Noisy zoom lever . The zoom lever on the top on the camera body was not a well made ( or designed ) part . When you zoom in & out using the lever , the noise is very obvious and annoying . This noise was clearly recorded heard from the tape when you playback . 3 ) The still camera quality is less than a regular 2.0 MP digital camera . 4 ) The strap that holds your hand of video filming is not in the right position to make your hand comfortable . 5 ) The 2.5 " view LCD screen has too much info displayed and this made the small 2.5 " LCD very noisy . I contacted the Canon USA for my questions . No clear answers were given about the image quality . I compared Optura 40 with Panasonic PV-GS200 , the Panasonic has far more better video image quality . Big disappointment for me .  
2	  excellent well made good quality material holds all the camera gear I need and with an Canon SLR 550D and separate flash As I said excellent .  
1	  To be honest , I was highly disappointed with this item ( when I did own it ) . Things that irked me : The screen was crisp , but it was black and white and had no backlight . It did not have a 5-way directional pad . Certain games didn't work with it because it only had 2 buttons . Planning things was quite a task with the tiny screen and sub-par handwriting recognition , so I ended up not using the calendar more often that not . One thing that I did enjoy using it for was catching up on tech headlines with AvantGo . However , seeing as there are ridiculous holiday sales going on , I may upgrade to the Zire 31 . I do find humor in the fact that whoever stole my Zire 21 is probably kicking themselves in frustration right now :-) .  
1	  I recently purchased these headphones and must say that I am dissapointed with their sound quality . While the range and volume is fine-bass response is ok and highs play without distortion-the overall sound is muddled . The sound is not crisp and clear . Rather , it sounds as if my music has already passed through some heavy object before reaching my ears . There is no problem understanding the music , don't get me wrong . Compared to the Coby headphones ( bought at around the same price ) that I was trying to replace , however , these headphones are simply not very good . I think Sennheiser makes good headphones , but I wouldn't waste any money on these . If you want a pair of Sennheisers , pay a little more to get one of their better models .  
1	  I purchased this item a month ago and if you only need to listen to audio for 3 hours at a time , it 's OK . I guess my sour attitude is related to the disappointment ; the unit is really well built .. both light and sturdy . The concept is interesting , but is executed poorly . If you take the time to fully charge the internal battery , you might get an hour out of it . Then take a newly charged battery and place it in the battery pack and you might get another two ( this is far shy of the 6.5 and 10 hours promised ) . And if you want the unit to listen to audio books , it will prove frustrating . If you pause for more than a few seconds , it will turn off ; leaving you to start the chapter or the book over . Whatever .. I 'm moving on to something else . You might think twice before wasting your time on this one .  
2	  Having a cap over the plug I think is safer than the retractable models . The automatic installer was familiar and easy to use ( I like it better than my similar Sony drive ) . It 's survived going through the wash 4 times also . Good value for the $ .  
2	  A couple of months ago I was sat at a UK airport waiting for a flight to Germany . I decided to stroll into the airport electronics shop and immediately noticed a cute little number sat on it 's cradle - I 'd fallen in love . I swiftly pulled out my credit card and purchased the Sexy Silver Compaq iPaq H3650 . I 'm a Psion man myself , but ever since that chance meeting in a remote airport , I 've never looked back . The iPaq is more than just another PDA , it a MP3 player , a picture viewer and a ebook reader plus more . One thing I like most about the iPaq is its ability to synchronise perfectly with Outlook . Psion products I 've had in the past always seemed to miss information or were difficult to setup . The iPaq was easy to setup and synchronisation through the serial or infrared ports is a breeze . I 'm left handed , but still find the handwriting recognition software extremely accurate . I would recommend the iPaq everytime - If you can get your hands on one .  
2	  One of the highlighted reviews gave this product 2 stars is because of what it isn't . I think it more fair to rate it for what it is . This is not a VHF antenna , but all of the stations in our area brodcast over UHF . That may change , but why pay double or triple the price to deal with some remote possibility ? This antenna works extremely well near Boston . Picks up 13 channels in crystal clear HD while sitting behind a stereo cabinet . If we put this on the roof , I bet it would pick up many more . This is a quality antenna that has amazingly strong reception at an incredibly cheap price . Just make sure you have an HD tuner , because it is absolutely useless without it . You cannot use it with an analog tuner or a digital converter box . It is meant for an HD tuner , and that is what you should plan on using it with . Buying this product will NOT make your analog TV into an HDTV .  
2	  Yet I have not bought or recieved a Zune yet , I plan on getting one . I have used my friends , are it was awesome . The sceen was so much bigger which made it easier to watch movies or music videos . Yes , it has very few accessories , but come on it just came out . I have already found a case I want for it and everything . If you compare ipod and Zune prices , Zune is a much better choice . A 30G ipod costs about $ 300 . A 30G Zune is about $ 250 . Now which one would you choose ? I have used an ipod before and it was much harder to control . Although it doesn't have everything an ipod has , I still think it is a much better choice . Not very many people would choose a Zune since ipods are still very popular , but I would . I did alot of research on Zunes and ipods , and found that I would feel alot happier with a Zune .  
2	  Man . Where to start . Reasons why the zen rocks the ipod . 1 ) the color screen is simply AMAZING . 2 ) all high quality movies gotten off bittorrent are 90 % divx and xvid . meaning you dont have to go through thedemeaning process of converting videos . 3 ) And for the ipod , if you do convert your videos , they are restricted ( quality wise ) to the point that apple forces you to buy their videos off itunes to avoid stabbing yourself . 4 ) Battery life . Conpared to the Original Zen PMC ( 12 hoursof video life ! ) the zen sucks . But against its current opponent , the ipod , the zen wins by 2 hours . Thats one more movie / 4 more episodes of family guy . 5 ) The shortcut button is an excellent idea . P.S. Sadly the only reason people find the ipod as a excellent mp3 player is that apple advertises the hell out of it . The ipod is actually a good mp3 player , it just isn't excellent like all of apple 's herd of sheep think it is ..  
1	  This unit stopped working after about 5 hours of use . It was never dropped or abused . Do not buy this unit !  
2	  OEM Epson inks are the right product for your inkjet Epson printer , as long as you care about things like color fidelity . Of course , that 's equally true if you use a different brand of printer . if you use lasers * and * dont care about color fidelity , you have more options . this seller provided current , legitimate Epson ink at a good price . thanks !  
1	  The first thing I tell people when they ask me what sort of digital camera they should buy is : " Make sure you buy one that doesn't use a proprietary battery . " In other words , if you can't walk into a drug store and buy batteries for it , keep looking . Any battery can go bad , even rechargable lithiums ( all it takes is one out of the three to die and you 're out of business ) . I 'm a big fan of rechargable AA batteries . Take two sets with you on vacation and if something goes wrong , drop into a drug store and buy replacements until you can find more rechargables . I have , however , found that Olympus makes the best digital cameras I 've ever used . The D-550 3-megapixil is superb and it uses AA batteries . One of its best features is in the Camedia software that comes with it . It corrects for the distortion found in ALL single lens digital cameras . If Olympus goes to propriatary batteries , they 've lost me as a customer . I don't want to be out in the middle of nowhere and suddenly have my battery go down . Nor do I want to find out , three years from now , that my battery is special order only and goes for an exorbitant price . I 've got a laptop computer by Lexmark in my closet that I could still be using , except the proprietary battery 's no longer being made . Finally , while the Olympus Stylus 410 4MP Digital Camera renders very nice photos , it has minor annoyances like " noise " - digital interference that pros can spot as coming from a digital camera . In low light , it also suffers from a slight purple cast in dark areas , neither of which my D-550 has . After batteries , quality of photos is my next big buying point . This camera is capable of taking great photos that are frameible , but you 'll have to add Photoshop Elements to the purchase to boost saturation and change color casts . The camera 's the right size . Anything smaller and it becomes unweildy .  
1	  this arrived totally dried and useless , I couldn't retrieve even a tiny bit of glue , very disappointing . Even tho ' inexpensive I was waiting for it so I could work on a project , and had to drive 40 minutes for another source . That 's why I was using Amazon in the first place .  
1	  Bought this camera 12/2005 . I was thrilled with this camera . But alas 15 months later the lcd started to go blank . By 18 months dead as a door nail . Contacted Canon . They said they were not aware of any ongoing problem with this model , but , they would fix it for a starting fee of $ 99.00 . This fee would be half of what I paid for it .  
1	  When I first received the product I was very pleased with its usability . The layout with the trackball and mouse keys is great . However , I could never use it to login , in would only work once I had logged into my Windows XP Pro system . After about two weeks it stopped working entirely - would not sync up between the keyboard and the receiver . I tried it on 3 computers using two different operating systems , none worked . I then tried contacting Adesso . My email was returned with useless instructions to check the FAQ or chat or call . I had already checked the FAQ . I repeatedly tried to chat and call during posted support hours and neither would respond . I returned it to [ .. ] - they were great about the return .  
2	  This is a great docking station , and nice little boombox . The sound might not be the most epic , but for the price it can't be beat . In comparison to other iPod speaker systems a great deal for the sound it does put out . Our family has four iPods , and absolutely love the convenience this radio offers . We have two of these units now , a blue one and a pink one , and never regretted out decision , not for a minute . If your looking for an economical and inexpensive charging / speaker system , look no further . Not only that , but its stylish , and keeps the iPod protected while docked , which most docks do not do . What more can you ask for ? Maybe better sound quality , but your not going to get that for this price point .  
1	  I like this amp but it causes my TV ( Sharp Aquos 42 " LCD ) to lose synch whenever the video has a sudden white flashes ( NFL sports transitions , War of the Worlds death-beam blasts , Drawn Together transitions , explosions , stuff like that ) . The synch loss takes about 5 or so seconds for my particular TV to recover from , which is pretty annoying . When I had the problem I searched the web and found that numerous others had similar problems with this and other Onkyo receiver models , but Onkyo doesn't seem to acknowledge the issue . It 's a good receiver , but if you buy it save the packing for a few weeks just in case it causes problems for your TV as well . Given that these problems seem to have been around for a good year or more and Onkyo isn't fixing them , I can only give this 2 stars .  
1	  I sent a message to the supplier and Amazon asking for information about returning the product . Although the product was listed as in stock in California , and I live in California , it took one week for delivery . I received no reply on my request for a return .  
1	  I used this on my 1500 watt straightener according to the directions and within 4 minutes there was smoke coming out of my straightener . This product is junk .  
2	  The motorcycle club I belong to uses C.B. Radios to communicate with each other while riding . Several of the radios used by our members cost nearly $ 1000.00 . This little handheld Midland 75-822 will perform and serve the same purpose as the expensive radios and in many cases out performing them . You need to install an external mobile antenna of some type . I use a mirror mount from Radio Shack and a cheap Firestik antenna and I have plenty of power , so much that I have to keep the radio on low power . I love the memory function and the channel lock function . If thunderstorms brew up the weather channels come in handy also . This little radio is small but mighty and can be used easily in all kinds of vehicles or out of the vehicle . It 's compact size allows me to put mine in my motorcycle tank bag right in front of me or put it in the trunk . Used with the 22-540 headset with boom mike for hands free operation , this inexpensive combination is hard to beat .  
1	  I received the Metal frame from Amazon . Apart from the really poor PC software , it worked fine except the pictures ALWAYS show in RANDOM order ( whether you pick RANDOM or SEQUENTIAL ) ! After a couple of emails and phone calls , Philips " Customer Service " agreed to replace it . I had to ship it to Philips at my OWN expense . After waiting over a month , I have received a replacement . It 's the Wood one - I wanted a Metal one ! I called " Customer Service " and they said they probably didn't have any Metal ones in stock . Anyway , the killer for me is that SEQUENTIAL photo viewing does not work on this one either ! I have 400 photos on my SD card and they can only show in RANDOM order - that is ridiculous . I have bought Philips products before but this will be the last that I buy ..  
2	  LaCie 301156U 1 TB Ethernet Big Disk Network Attached Storage Hard Driveis doing everything as it is described in the product description . I Have a wired network consisting of 8 devices , PC / Printer / etc . Even Linux it works . Have since , ordered , received , and install the USB version only , and it also works great . 500GB for 99 bucks , how can you beat that ?  
1	  this was the wrong cord for the product i purchased i returned it for a full refund .  
2	  I doubt that for the money there is a better built , better functioning , set of headphones on the market !  
1	  Junk .. It work but is very very limited . No power control just excessively bright useless light . The only way to get a good photo out of this is to bounce the flash off a wall or diffuse it multiple times .  
1	  Ive only had this cord for 30 days and already doesn't work . It has come apart at the end of the cord going into the plug . It lives in my car and is almost never touched so I don't think over use is the issue but just a poorly made product . It worked great for the first 30 days though .  
2	  As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book " Take Me To A Circus Tent " and a former radio disc-jockey ( That worked in several electronic stores ) , I am often asked to write and or discuss various audio products and recordings from the 60 's and 70 's . TEAC AD500 Combination CD / Cassette DeckIf you are looking for a very good unit that will play both CD 's and tapes , this is a wise choice . Teac has a strong reputation and quality for those that don't see the justification for spending more then 215.00 to 225.00 . There are a couple of terrific features included in this unit . The headphone jack has a volume control and the tape deck has pitch control . If you have ever found a tape sounding too fast or a bit on the slow side , you can adjust the pitch for normal playback . The entire AD500 is under twelve pounds . As always try to use quality tapes such as Maxell or TDK for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment . Dirty heads will give the playback muddy results . Enjoy the music and be well , Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book " Take Me To A Circus Tent "  
2	  The subject modem was easy to install and the enclosed CD software made setup a breeze .  
2	  I LOVE this printer ! I 've owned one since a few months after they became available , and bought a camera ( HP 618 ) well-matched to it . Here 's the good , the bad , and the ugly - and I 've experienced all three but still love the printer enough to be getting a new one right now . Beautiful quality pictures , great features , easy install but drivers for XP may be challenging to find . Can be used to make prints without the aid of a computer . Front panel with LCD display and all controls available to select paper and quality options , multiple copies , etc . Big 45ml ink tanks seem to last a long time . I saw another reviewer say 50 to 75 8x10 color prints can be produced on a set of ink tanks , and I 'd say that 's probably pretty accurate . If you do a lot of general everyday printing of webpages and letters & stuff as well as photos , you 'll get many more pages , especially if you use draft mode when you don't need the high-quality pages you get from the default settings . Can accept type I & II memory cards , and uses USB or parallel port to connect to a computer . Also can use infra-red data connection IF your camera is HP JetSend compatible , but this is difficult to find in a camera now , even if you get a camera from HP . Now for the bad . Some documentation as well as directional symbols on the printer make it easy to insert envelopes incorrectly resulting in upside-down orientation . Paper jams can be tricky to clear , and may cause frustration which in my case possibly led to more printer damage . Difficult to operate 4x5 special photo tray , which can contribute to paper feed errors if not positioned correctly when not in use . Ink cartridges ( when they do finally run out ) can be expensive if you use the genuine HP cartriges , about $ .. for the tri-color , and $ .. for the black . Cheaper ones are available in smaller volume ( HP genuine , half filled ) , and substantially cheaper full-size refills ( from Staples ) are available for about half or less these costs . And the ugly : If you start getting frequent paper jam errors , good luck getting this printer fixed since it has been discontinued and parts are unavailable . I didn't have paper jam problems until after a couple of years and probably around 2100 pages . The test print you can run from the front panel shows my total pages printed to be 2985 . I tried to get repairs from two local authorized HP service centers in Toledo , OH as well as from HP customer service , and the best they ( a local place ) could do for me was to replace the printer with a reconditioned one at about $ .. HP could only offer me - get this - a reconditioned unit for about $ .. OR a swap for over $ .. ( ? ) . Their replacement parts page lists a " printer replacement " option for over $ .. ! What 's up with that ? They recommended a " trade up " to the 7150 photosmart , a terrible idea to me since it has none of the features of the P1000 - no IR , no memory card options , not standalone , smaller ink tanks - for around $ .. " Trade-UP " must be a reference to the money THEY will make from more frequent ink purhcases by consumers . Plus , instead of a tri-color and a black cartridge , the 7150 uses a tri-color and a " photo " color by default , and if you want to do a lot of black they expect you to buy an " optional " black cartridge which you swap out with the " photo color " cart . I guess the P1000 line just had too many nice features for HP to allow it to survive , so if you want one get it while you can . Even with the problems I 've had I want another , it has EXCELLENT bang for the buck !  
2	  One might think it is impossible to review a cable .. However , feel compelled to add that this cable is compatable with the Zire 72s . Therefore , if you are looking for a second cable so you can synchronize at home and work , this is an acceptable one .  
1	  cheap you can hear the wind on the cord while just walking have to turn sound up high so you don't hear noise I read this in other reviews and didn't think it was a problem it is . had a set of v-moda 's before that sounded great but had a bad plug arrangement , but i 'm not sure about the company now . not worth the money . read all the reviews  
1	  I have a new pioneer in the mid range of models and when you turn it up distortion big time . I was told a amp may help but think twice before you try to save money with these .  
2	  I recently purchased this camera for my wife .. well it was a Mother 's Day present , but it quickly became one of my favorite toys in the house .. Anyway , this is our second digital camera , this one replacing the family 's Sony DSC-P71 3.2 MP . The Fuji blows away the previous camera that we had , image quality far surpassing my expectations . Although an avid photo taker of my children , I had really never had professional photo training .. with this in mind , I did some research , and came up with the Fuji S5100 as the best camera for my budding photo craze .. I am very pleased by the camera 's Look , feel , and overall weight balance . Image quality is exceptional especially for a 4MP camera , I have found it takes photos at the quality of a higher MP camera . Price was incredible .. $ 314 on sale at Best Buy + $ 50 rebate from Fuji = $ 264 .. a steal , considering that I resold our last camera for $ 140 .. overall net cost to me was $ 124 . Again , this is our first more serious digital camera , and love it .. at thisi point would definitely buy another Fuji product ..  
1	  The firewall is useless if you have more than one machine behind it . The port forwarding does not allow ranges of internal IP addresses , and if you specify more than one the the port stops working for ALL addresses . For example , want to open TCP / 123 for NTP synchronization ? Have more than one machine ? If you don't forward the port , you can't connect to the NTP server . If you forward one IP , it works , but if you forward both IP addresses , neither of them are able to connect to NTP . There appears to be no support for RTP / RTSP streaming ( e.g. , QuickTime ) , though there is a mysterious ( and essentially undocumented ) " port triggering " feature . Absolutely no idea how this is supposed to work ; the docs are nearly useless and there is nothing on the Linksys web site . In spite of the claims in the data sheet , it could not connect to the common IPSec VPN my company uses . It does not offer the option of logging firewall violations , so troubleshooting is very difficult . I 'm using the latest firmware 1.40.2 .  
1	  Chalk me up as another who wished he had read the reviews before this purchase . It works when it is being charged , and won't work otherwise . Also , for the price and look of it , the images are not impressive-not very clear compared with less expensive models . Here it is 2 days before Christmas and I bought 2 of these and now have to find replacements . ( In case you were wondering , yes , I had the same problem with both ) .  
2	  Not only did Apex come through for me in a TV situation I found myself in , Amy one of their Cust . Reps . picked up the pieces for me . She was knowledgeable , patient and courteous . Right there every time I needed help . I would highly recommend APEX for any and all of your electronics . Check it out for yourself . Go ahead . " Thanks Apex and Amy " . moolie  
2	  I bought the second one as a gift . I have spilled drinks on mine and I have been able to easily take it apart and clean it . Still works perfect . I really like the choice of light color for the background . I 'll buy another for myself when and if mine wears out .  
1	  I bought this to replace a similar model I had that had gotten old and was wearing out , but this one has terrible sound . I don't know if it 's just the connection of the wire or the device , but there 's just constant background static . I had to go back to the old one .  
2	  Have used these cards for just about everything ; Pentax digital camera and now a Canon Power Shot . It also works perfectly in our Sony digital camcorder . I use these cards for all of my trail cams , and I have several different brands . They have lived through excessive moisture , heat and extreme cold . As far as I 'm concerned , you can't beat these for the price .  
2	  I bought this for my wife to use on her laptop . She has small hands so this was a perfect mouse . It tracks well and has a short cord which stays out of the way . If you want one for your desktop system get something else as the cable is VERY short .  
2	  Having stepped up to thumb drives , external hard drives , and all the " new age " goodies for my computer , I ran across some older ZIP disks with important information on them . But my drive had log ago disappeared . Found just what I needed , the order was fulfilled in short order and I 'm back in business again retrieving info I had believed was long lost . I even found several boxes of brand new Zip disks I can utilize . The unit is self sustained , loads it 's own driver , is VERY portable as it connects to a USB so that means I can take it with me anywhere . I highly recommend you purchase one of these units if you have such a need .  
2	  Some people have found this Linksys printer works fine , others think it 's junk and that Linksys support is poor . I have a complete Linksys wireless home network linked to wireless broadband ( the best option here in rural New Zealand ) and it works extremeley well - including this little print server that handles the printing from a desktop PC and two laptops that print from anywhere in the relatively large house . So why do so many people report frustrations ? The problem with the whole Linksys wireless range is that the instructions don't cover Windows network setup features that may be needed to complete an installation . If you 've installed this print server using the Linksys CD and get a ' failed connection ' message fron Windows , you probably need to do these additional Windows-specific steps . Go to Start - Programs - Print Server Utility - Print Driver Setup . Ensure printer and Linksys print server box are connected and powered up . The Printer Port Setup box should appear , showing the name of the Linksys print server device and the port number and name of your connected printer . It 's useful to note these down accurately for a further step below . Go to Start - Control Panel - Printers and Faxes - File menuIf your printer icon is there right-click the icon and delete the printer . Then force Windows to get it fully connected again by going to the Control Panel 's File menu and selecting Add Printer . On the Wizard , select ' A network printer ' , then ' Browse for a printer ' . If the Linksys print server with connected printer aren't found , select ' Connect to this printer ' instead . Enter for example \\ LK90B8AF\EPSON Stylus Photo R900 where the first entry is the default print server name printed on the back of the Linksys device ( unless you changed the name during its installation from the Linksys CD ) and the second entry is your printer 's name . ( These are the details from the Printer Port Setup stage above . You don't include the port number from the Printer Port Setup stage . ) You may then be asked to allow the driver to be installed , which Windows XP should be able to do automatically for any modern plug & play printer . Your printer should then appear in the Printers and Faxes Control Panel with Windows ' little ' pipe ' icon attached , indicating its a network printer . Right-click the printer icon and under Properties - Advanced check ' Print directly to the printer ' ( instead of spooling ) , as not doing this often causes a connection failure . I 've found Linksys support to be excellent for product-specific issues but ( not surprisingly really ) they 're not so good at carrying this through to Windows-specific tweaking that may be needed if a basic installation hasn't worked .  
1	  I 've had fairly good luck with amazon products but this one didn't work out so well . I went to install a car stereo in my brothers ' 1994 ford ranger and neither of the products that I ordered from amazon worked for his truck , even though the website said they fit . I triple checked to make sure they were compatible . This kit wasn't even needed . I just slipped the CD player in , it clicked and I was done . I hate wasting money .  
2	  I originally bought this remote to control my family room satellite box and AV receiver from my patio . I have a tv in the patio that is connected to the satellite box from the family room . I was concerned that the remote would not work , since I had bad luck with a radio shack rf / infrared solution . The remote works as advertised with great range . It was easy to program . It controls everything I need to for only 79.99 . I would have paid 200 bucks to get this performance . I liked it so much , that I bought a second one to control a tv in another room . I did not even have to connect the flashers . You can't beat this remote for the money .  
2	  After reading some negative reviews on another after-market brand of battery , I bought this one due to its price and better than average reviews . It performs as well as the Sony battery .  
2	  Great lens at a great price . Used as a replacement for a simmilar lens , and can't say enough about it .  
2	  I have been using this camera for about two years , and I have a long experience in creative photography . I can say without any hesitation that the Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera is on of the best cameras in the market today . It has all the sophisticated functions that any professional photographer may need . The only thing that I did not like is the lens ; I changed it to a Sigma 14 - 200 mm , which is equal to 28 - 300 mm in a conventional SLR . It gives me the ability to zoom from a wide angle lens of 28 mm to a telephoto lens of 300 mm in a second , which is a great advantage in many situations ,  
1	  This was a great player until it stopped working . It all of a sudden quit playing out of one earphone .  
1	  I bought this to use in my new Asus 1005PR in the SD slot for ReadyBoost . It failed the speed tests not matter what I did .. and I did everything from full format NTFS , to setting the SD driver for increased performance to compressing , all of which others on the web said might get a non speed conforming SD card up to ReadyBoost standards , all of which failed . I suppose this is a good price for an SD of this size , but if you are looking to use this for ReadyBoost you need to go with a higher speed memory .  
1	  The product is probably fine , however , I didn't know when ordering that my TV had to have the correct plugs for it to work properly , my set is probably 15 years old and I don't have any plugs I can use to connect the earphones . Probably my own problem as my tv is so out of date with all the new technology . Your product information should maybe say something about what is needed to make a connection . Hopefully , I 'll be able to use them if I ever get a newer TV .  
1	  This product works wonderful . I bought it for my epson printer and I have no problem with it .  
2	  The camera is amazing . Especially considering the price . The pic quality is good . Its light weight . The lense cover turns the camera on as well as protects the lense from dirt and dust . 5 ( x ) digital zoom is surprisingly clear . The Cammera didn't need drivers to be installed for it to work on Win 2000 . As soon as the USB port was plugged in from pc to camera Windows installed the Cammera as its own drive . From there its as simple as drag and drop . The few downfalls with the camera are that it is a bit to big to throw in your pocket . No optical zoom . The USB cable isn't the standard type , so this particular cable is the only one you can use to transfer files . Over All , Definatly a very nice product .  
1	  I love HP . But i would never buy one with a PP processor . PATHETIC PENTIUM . LOL . everybody that has one doesnt amount to my 1.4 amd pavillion . Oh .. it could be a decent computer though . Perhaps it was dropped . I dont like the idea of having one shipped to my address . I work for ups and not everything is handled with care . We do try though .  
1	  Easy setup , great at first . Then it started dropping connections and acting flaky . The problem was not my DSL provider ( SBC ) , because a direct connection to my PC always works perfectly . Then , about three weeks after the warranty expired , it stopped transmitting any wireless signal . Thanks , LinkSys !  
1	  How many single user pc 's are this security conscience ? Per Targus , this device cannot log you into a network and there are NO PLANS to make it work with a network !  
2	  The material is not as high quality as Apple 's chargers , but frankly , $ 0.46 ? Who cares ? It gets the job done ! My iPod Classic didn't burn or explode or did anything dramatic , as some reviewers hinted it might happen - it just charged normally . Great purchase for such little money .  
2	  1 ) The wire is copper and the color is exactly as pictured . 2 ) The wires split easily ( by pulling apart , no scissors need ) and they strip fine . 3 ) The PVC insulation is sufficiently thick and very pliable4 ) The wire is as strong as any other I have used . I cut of a chunk and tried to break it with my hands . Sure , the insulation stretches a little but it IS plastic after all . 5 ) The only legitimate complaint I read is that the gauge is smaller than 18 , and I would agree that it is actually 20 . If you were using all 100 ft , you 'd be talking about 1 ohm resistance versus 0.65 ohm ( could be significant at HIGH current draws ) , but how many people are doing a 100ft run with large speakers ? For a 15 ft run , it is . 15 versus . 1 ohms - negligible .  
2	  The Raynox M150 is a very cost effective way to get up close to bugs and flowers . I use it with a Nikon 50mm AF-D and a 55-200 AF-S . I 'm sure that a dedicated Macro would be better at some things but , for what I do , the Raynox M150 is great .  
2	  I 've tried a bunch of FM transmitters , and this one is hands down the best .  
1	  I bought two sets of 2 speakers so I could add them to my patio and am disappointed . I have 2 of the four that have crackling going on in background after just a few weeks of use . These speakers cannot do stereo sound . Considering you receive 2 in a package you would think that they can be mono / stereo as a choice but no . The remote is nice and either remote works on all four speakers I bought so they are interchangable . The unit cannot be turned on by the remote , it can only be controlled by remote after manual power on button has been pressed which is annoying . If I had a choice now I would have chosen different outside speakers . They do have good sound as long as you do not turn the volumn up very high since they will start bust speaker easily .  
1	  Like with the Logitech Communicate STX webcam I purchased ( and returned ) , this camera had a delay of almost a 1/2 second between the audio and the video . I tried it with a Pentium 2 500 MHz , then a Pentium 3 , 860 MHz , 512 MB RAM and then on an almost untouched , brand new P4 eMachine , 2.8 GHz , 768 MB RAM . In my opinion it would be better just to have audio than to have every single syllable out of synch with the video , which I find to be very distracting . In addition to this significant problem , the camera did not have a built-in mic and it had a lightwieght base which allowed it to easily slide around ( and a couple times fall ) . However , the video display quality I did find to be good even in relatively low light conditions . I have since returned the WebCam Live and purchased a Logitech QuickCam Fusion ( which is about double the price of the Live ) and I have been very satisfied . Audio and video synchronization on the Fusion seems to be just about perfect , even when running it on the P3 , 860 MHz PC with a USB 1.0 port .  
2	  I absolutely love my keyboard . It never gets dirty , and I tote it everywhere , just tossed ( with love and care ) into my bag . Got it in June , use it almost daily and haven't had to change the batteries once ( mid-December now ) . Highly , highly recommend this . I have friends with other Bluetooth keyboards , and they don't compare - they 're cheap , rattly , clunky things . This has true Mac style , built to last , worth the extra money .  
1	  I have to say the same thing as the last review . I purchased the Sony projector 4 months ago . The bulb is only under warantee for 3 months . The first CS person told me it was covered and to take it in to a depot . Then I was told it wasn't covered by the depot but that I could purchase it for $ 450 plus the labour of $ 150 to install a bulb that can't take them more then 5 minutes . I have gone back and forth with Sony support for 4 weeks . And they are now saying they 'll give me a discount but the discount is based on getting it fixed at the depot and I 'll get sony gift certificates back . I have purchased a lot of Sony stuff in my life but I will never buy anything again . I was so disappointed with support on this product that I would never have bought one given the choice . It is very good quality but the cost of ownership is just too ridiculous . I can't stress enough that there are many other great products out there . Go with one that has good support .  
2	  Still pretty early to make a final judgement , however so far so good . Very encouraging . Disappointed in shipping costs however .  
2	  I am pleased with the functions and general features of the PVR . The one thing that bugs me is the PVR ERROR message that has replaced the menu icons . This is the second PVR I have owned with this same anomaly . The first , I returned within warranty to Amazon and they replaced it . Yeah Amazon ! This one I have now is past the warranty period . All the functions of the player still work ; just have to remember what icon used to be where .  
2	  Very good card and a good price . Received it in a speedy amount of time and would buy from this retailer again .  
1	  This is feedback on Panasonic . I will not buy another Panasonic product . Our 42-inch plasma died right after the extended warranty expired .. that was $ 1700 down the drain .. estimate to fix was $ 600 due to a circuit board that seems to blow a lot on this model .. is that a product defect .. there are enough blogs on this problem ? I decide to buy a 46 inch LCD ? LED SamSung Smart TV AND thought I could use my SC-PT950 with the new TV . This sound system has a great sound .. except for the rear speaker .. can hardly hear them . The most dissappointing thing is that it doesn't work with Netflix .. I have to buy a blue ray .. at least I think that 's what the tech support said .. he hung up without saying bye .. so fast that I wasn't able to ask him if I could buy a blue ray and still use the speaker . Wow .. what an expensive mistake this package was .. UPDATE .. My son-in-law fixed the problem .. took an extra audio cord and plugged it directly from the tv to the Home Theater system versus going thru the cable box . It works perfectly tho we use the TV remote when we watch netflix . Wonder why the Panasonic tech couldn't have provided that simple solution . Oh well , happy now .. don't have to spend bucks on a new theater system or to buy a blue ray .. the speakers are not operating as they should .. but I don't care .. front speakers are fine . Still won't buy Panasonic again .. tech support is too unhelpful .  
2	  Great item for the price . I use this filter to increase my exposure time . This is a high quality filter and worthly of high end lenses . [ .. ] Thanks !  
1	  I bought this adapter so as to be able to connect USB devices to a micro-USB cable which I have . However , the adapter will not work if connected to a micro-USB cable - it must be connected to a cable which also has regular ( " A " ) USB at the other end .  
2	  I received this item almost the next day and have had no problems in using it ! I 've since seen the same item at more than twice the price elsewhere .  
1	  Both sets of these batteries worked when I put them into the camera ( on the 1st set I did take 1 photo ) but the next time I turned the camera on , they were dead . I paid nearly $ 7 . for a single photo . I use other rechargeables & regular cheaper batteries & they all last . The one time I splurge .. duds . I contacted Kodak and they simply sent me 2 batteries ( not 4 like I paid for ) and said they 'd discount it a little if I 'd upgrade the camera . Not helpful . My camera is fine . I checked that before I contacted them in case it was the camera . Very disappointing . I 'll stick with cheap Duracell 's if this is what ' the good stuff ' does .  
1	  This hard case is cheap , cheesy plastic with velco to fasten your PDA to the interior . It is inconceivable that this is a PalmOne product but the sad fact is that it is indeed . Avoid , avoid , avoid . I returned mine to the store from whence it came and the return was accepted despite the opened bubble pack .  
1	  Can't say I am too happy with these headphones . I prefer my previous pair ( Sony MDR-NC6 ) . I believe the noise cancelling feature was much better than Philips which at times not only sounds distorted but volume decreases when I turn the feature on . I will say the Philips is very comfortable and comes in a great hard case .  
2	  After having a set ( forgot what brand ) of wireless speakers which failed miserably , I was somewhat hesitant to buy another set . Based on the reviews I read , this was supposed to be very good so I gave it a shot . Was pleasantly suprised at the sound quality , and solid ( albeit plastic ) construction . Being able to withstand some moisture was a plus as they were primarily going to be used outside . I bought two , which works well as they can be switched from mono when used in two different locations to stereo when used together . Of course , I have two transmitters but I guess its good to have a spare . They are very easy to tune in which was a huge problem with the other type I had . The folding handle is a great feature , and using the speaker for a drink holder .. a little over the top but I guess it says something about its water protection . All in all , very satisified .  
2	  I bought these headphones as a gift for my father . The sound quality is great and for the price , you cant beat it ! They fit over the ear perfectly , totally would buy for someone else in the future !  
1	  It is difficult to quickly use since every 30 minutes I must be reset to be able to continue using it , and the battery unloading , in addition I must have loading all along it since if I disconnect it although it has new batteries and just loaded , remains out of line quickly  
2	  So good that my wife didn't even realize there was a filter on her new lens ! Would buy again . Fits securely and is crystal clear .  
2	  these speakers are awesome ! 5.1 surround sound format , has a variety of inputs , heaphone out , digital optical and coaxial in , and 3 mini jacks . the sound quality is superb , the bass is not overwhelming if you set it to the right setting . the sound quality is crisp and clear . my dad played with these speakers more than i did when i got them . and amazon and fedex rock . amazon had a 5 % off discount with free shipping offer . i took advantage of that and paid less than $ 220 shipped . i was scheduled to receive the speakers 5-10 days after i ordered it ( i ordered it on a saturday morning ) and received it in 3 days ! i was leaning towards getting the 3 day shipping for $ 60 but i didnt have the money , so i got the free shipping . what do you know , i got free 3 day shipping .  
2	  The items were just as I expected them to be and I received the order in a very timely fashion ( within a week ! )  
2	  This is a really nice piece of equiptment . It 's small size fits everyones hand comfortably . It is very sensitive , ( adjustable in control panel ) , and a charge lasts hours . The charging cord is included with the mouse , and connects to a USB port to charge . Can even charge while you are using the computer . If you want the freedom of a cordless mouse for a cheap price grab this one . I 've been using it for about three months and am completely satisfied .  
2	  I have been an Apple Mac user since 1985 when the first Mac came out . It was a 128K model ( $ 2,795 ) . The difference between that early Mac and the new iMac 2.16GHz , 20 inch model ( $ 1,399 ) is like riding a mule vs . taking the space shuttle to get around . My new iMac 2.16GHz ( plus a new Mac Mini ) have state of the art technology that is beyond stellar . I control my life with these new machines : bill paying , communications ( I am email centric ) , light graphics work , printing and so on is done with Macs . Macs were always good with graphics , but now they are the very best out of the box and I find myself regularly archiving family photos with ease , photos that might never have come out of their shoeboxes without Mac 's new iPhoto . What I need to do probably only uses 5 % of iMac 's capacity to perform . Also , with the Universal capability Macs and PCs are almost joined at the hip so when I get stuff from friends who use PCs I can open almost all their attachments . It was not always this way . Also , I travel a great deal and now can easily stay on top of my life with a speedy Mac on the internet . No more running to post offices all over creation to send off all those routine bill payments . I can't imagine what else I might need in a computer . My needs are not all that complex , I am not a geek or gamer , but the new iMac is worth every penny for normal users too and iMacs covers almost all of the bases ( 99 %) that most people need to cover . And it is just about crash proof so it humms through its chores with ease and with very little frustration for the user . I have never owned a PC , but over the past two decades I have been tempted more than once . I thought about switching to have broader access to everything that makes up the personal computer world . But now I never will switch , there is no need to ! Mac has closed the universality gap and zoomed by PCs and is not looking back ..  
1	  We have had this television for 7 months , and the picture quality has degraded to absolute garbage . Everything is a nauseating spring green , and no adjustment will cure the problem . Highlights are totally blown out , and shadow detail is not visible . Even tho the set is under warranty , Thomson ( RCA ) is giving us the run around about repair or replacement . Even the authorized service center can't get a straight answer or parts . Avoid RCA if you don't have a ' toss it out in 6 months and buy another set ' mentality . Buy a Sony .  
2	  I love this lens . It brings you right up to the action . It takes an amazing , clear image . The image stabilization works great and has both Mode 1 and 2 . The ultrasonic auto focus is super fast and quiet . Well worth the price !  
2	  What I like most about these earbuds is that they won't come out of my ears if the cord happens to get yanked . They are very convenient for me and this is my second set in 5 years .  
1	  The picture and sound may be gorgeous , however beware ! The one that I got emits frequecy so bad that my neighbours were complaining that it jammed their radios . I have Panasonic technician come out and check it and he confirmed that the frequency emit was high and report back to Panasonic factory , but the factory technician said they cannot do anything , which means that I as the customer and my neighbours have to live with it . It was sad to hear that because the frequency was so bad that it jammed the radio . Think twice before you buy ! Good picture , good sound but bad service ! Will you pay thousand of dollars for a product that the manufacturer will just ignore their problem ?  
1	  This is the worst CPU , worst that AMD Duron . This CPU is not really running at 1.7Ghz , the cache on this CPU is only 128 , comapring to P4 512 . They say 1.7 but really runs at 1.2 GHZ or less comparing to P4 or Athlon XP .  
1	  This product seems like it would be a wonderful product if it actually worked . The item arrived with more than half of the keys completely non-functional , even with firm pressure applied directly to the center of the keys . Entire rows of keys were nonfunctional , hinting at some sort of electrical / wiring issue . The keys that do work seem to work fairly well and without too much effort . If you manage to get a keyboard that actually works , it might actually be worth it . Otherwise , I wouldn't recommend it .  
2	  Had the camera in the back of the car with some other things , my kids picked up their toys and draged the end of the strap with them . Camera fell about 3 feet on to the concrete , filter shattered the lens is ok . Replaced it immediately .  
2	  I ordered this to replace a broken power cord for an old Technics digital piano and it works great . It was much cheaper than any other replacement cord I found on the web ( even with shipping ) . This cord is non-polarized , so make sure that 's what you need .  
2	  Have been using this switch for over 6 months . It is fairly compact , well ventilated . The case has holes around the body which makes it easy to mount it with zip ties . It has no problems with 9K jumbo packets and it idles at 1W . It 's a perfect 5port gigE switch .  
1	  In traditional landscape mode , these filters work just like they 're supposed to . However , if you prefer to rotate your screen to portrait mode like I do , they become less than useless . The screen can be seen from just about any angle , except sitting right next to the user , and the screen is darker , but without any privacy benefits .  
2	  I bought HC85 in July , but got a real chance to shoot for long hours only in October . I found all the controls very very effective and handy . also to add to its video the Still photographs that are captured at 2 Mega pixels are amazingly good . I also tested the Photographs by getting a print and its good enough and comparable with any other camera ( 2 mega pixel ofcourse ) . Though i am having a problem or rather some confusion about . 1 . Formatting the Video while getting it from tape to hard disk2 . The video Quality when i view it after writing to VCD is not that good . Probably i am missing some setting while using itit would be great if someone could help me out on this .  
1	  I wrote an earlier review praising this DVD player . But , the more movies we played , the more it would freeze up during play . The last 3 movies we watched ( The Matrix , U-751 , Eraser ) , it would freeze 10-15 times a movie . So , I called a few toshiba service centres in town and I got very inconsistent feedback on what the problem could be . Some would say .. " Oh you need a firmware upgrade " . But some would tell me that there are no upgrades available for the SD2700 . With that information , I said to hell with this .. it 's going back to the store for a full refund . Knowing that the sound and picture I was getting from Toshiba was awesome , I told myself that I would try Toshiba again , given that I probably had bought the SD2700 in a broken state . So , last week I went to the store and asked questions for almost 2 hours , of which DVD would meet my needs . It was a toss-up between Panasonic and Toshiba . I settled once again on the Toshiba , but an upgraded model from the SD2700 .. I bought the SD2710 , which plays MP3 's . So far it plays all the movies that the SD2700 didn't . I know that the SD2700 I bought was definitely broken , so don't let this review scare you . I 'm very happy with the SD2710 .  
2	  The slingbox is the best thing that you can get if you travel alot . with the AV i am able to watch my TV from home with great picture and it works great overseas . It beats the crappy TV they have over there ,  
1	  I ordered a red ibeatle headset Organizer in February 2009 and received a silver iBeatle . I promptly called and told them of the wrong color and was told that the red was out of stock and they would send one free of charge when they were back in stock . It is the end of June 2009 , and my order has not been corrected , nor has there been any communications what the status is .  
2	  Regarding the highlighted review by L. Wimberley : The Digital Rebel XT is equipped to detect whether you 're shooting horizontally or vertically . To do so , there may be a free-hanging piece within the camera to detect which way is up as you hold the camera . This may be what 's making the rattling sound . The sensor is handy , as the camera uses this data to auto-rotate images in the viewfinder for you when they were shot vertically .  
2	  zune vs ipod ipod wins ipod 80gb has evertying you need for fun cartrip or being bord ipod can help lots of music greta videos best mp3 ever  
2	  I think they 're a really great pair of binoculars , for me they were the optimal specs . The 10 times magnification allowed a closeup on far away birds and even a good view of the moon , but not such a high magnification that makes it hard to find things in the sky . For my use I didn't need water proof or fog proof lenses so get the Extreme line if that 's what you want , but these are great general-purpose binoculars . The lenses are also high quality . The weight is a little heavy , but first of all that 's what you get for having 50 mm diameter lenses , plus we knew that going into it for a better image . Obviously they wouldn't make the best field binoculars ( though you can use them for that if you wanted to ) , but for my own purposes I couldn't imagine a better pair at a better price , so overall I 'm extremely satisfied . I recommend doing research into the kind of binoculars you need depending on your use before choosing , but if it matches the capacity of this bad boy , then I wholeheartedly recommend it .  
2	  This baby monitor works great . We use a video monitor also , but we got this monitor so we could carry the receivers with us when away from our video monitor . The reception is great .. no static and it picks up every little sound imaginable ! We put the monitor in the living room and it picked up the soft ticking of the clock in the kitchen .. crystal clear ! The receivers work great and at a far distance . Definately a great buy and with this monitor , you can rest assured that you will hear your baby when she needs you .  
2	  This is just an all around great little storage case for your stick drives . Mine have stayed in place and protected . I would definitely recommend this product .  
2	  This is a small mouse that fits easily in my laptop bag . I was initially afraid that it would be difficult to move around as i was used to larger traditional mice . However , once I ( quickly ) got used to it , I found that its even easier and more comfortable to use than large ergonomic mice - the reason being that you can simply rest your wrist on the table and push this mouse around with your fingers . Your whole hand need not move ! Very nice feel to it for me . The only downside to the atek mouse that i bought was that after a year or so of use , its buttons became less responsive - sometimes clicks just don't register . Could it be that this small mouse isn't as rugged as I had hoped ? I haven't banged this mouse around and always keep it in its soft pouch in my bag , so I 'm a little dissappointed that its causing problems now . I 'm not sure if others who have been using this mouse for a long time have had this same problem . But despite that , I 'd still quite likely that I 'd buy this mouse again . The only feature I miss ( from larger mice ) , is a scrollwheel of some kind . If someone at Atek could stick an Apple Mighty-Mouse style micro-scroller on this mouse , I would marry them , * and * buy the mouse again for sure .  
2	  I needed this for an older garmin , in order to get a track from a friend . I hope to use the track this winter !  
1	  It worked fine with my mouse , wireless adapter and USB drive . It did not work with either of my external hard drives which both have 2 USB cords , one for data and one for power so clearly it doesn't carry enough juice for the hard drives . I have a spider type adapter that works fine with all my devices and it was about half the price so I 'll get a few more of those . I also had a hard time squeezing my USB drive in next to another port so the ports are just a little too close together . It installed itself without any issues and is nice and compact so it may be ok for some .  
2	  Small enough to keep handy and takes generally first-rate pictures . 7X zoom greatly enhances use . SD card enables easy uploading to computer . Macro setting lets camera serve as scanner / note taker . Recorder mode can capture lectures . Large screen good for sharing pictures or slide shows while built-in software permits cropping , resizing and other edits . Amazing battery life . Internal lens and front slide protects lens . Starts up quickly . Areas for improvement : pictures taken in low light or at high magnification can be blurred . A well-designed , inexpensive case would help portability .  
2	  Shipping was fine and timely . I liked this product very much . I think if one is inclined for lots of pictures , I would go probably 16GB instead of 8GB . Product as such is fantastic . I am planning to buy 32GB sometime with class 8 or 10 from transcend .. sometime in the future .  
1	  I bought this product so I could use Skype on my laptop . Unfortunately , the size of the jack is not designed to fit into a laptop .  
2	  Despite the comments by one , everyone loves thier player . I take mine everywhere . It has never skipped ( Even when I drop it ! Oops ! ) , and the finish is still there . I have had it for a year , and still haven't had to change the batteries . All of it 's functions are great ! Plus , it gives off great sound ! It 's size is also fantastic . In most of my pants , it can actually fit in the pockets . The headphones aren't the greatest , but who cares ? This is the best you can get for your money .  
2	  This was shipped immediately and arrived very quickly . Great service . Would recommend to anyone .  
2	  This works great , i bought the USB adapter as well . It took me less than 10 minuts to set up . The only problem is when i move the router near the 900 MHZ phone it stops working . So ihvae to move it away ( 6 feet ) away from the phone .  
2	  We purchased this for our 15 " laptop and it works great and fits perfectly ! We tried several other brands and nothing works as well as this one . I often sit on the couch with the laptop on a pillow and it still cools my computer ! It is quiet and doesn't really drain my battery . It is worth the money and I highly recommend it !  
2	  This filter was a recommended product when I bought my Panasonic FZ35 . I am an amateur photographer and honestly didn't know I need this . It was cheap enough for me to just buy it and not worry because I 'm sure it 's a good idea to have it . Fits perfectly on my Panasonic FZ35 .  
2	  I live in an area that has a lot of free wifi links open to me but I was just out of range of them . I ordered the Hawking usb wireless G Dish and was enformed it would take three to four weeks to receive but I got it in two days . The conection is great . I enjoy the ease of its install and I have had no problems with it . A download that took 50 or 60 mins now takes 5 mins . I very happy with the small dish . One thing sometimes heavy rain breaks down the the conection speed .  
1	  The " remove tape " issue and damage to tapes started in less then two years . We spent $ 1000 for this camera for two years , you can buy two camera 's for that cost now with the same features . I wish we would have read the reviews before buying . It was a nice camera when it was new thats why it gets 1-star from me and not 0-stars .  
1	  for as much as it costs , its a piece of junk . Most FM transmitters are , i heard some good things about this one , so i thought it would be better , and it wasnt = ( , and i dont even live in the city , it has alot of static , and garbled , underwater  
2	  first , let me say that i am no " videophile " . i am not hung up on minute differences in picture quality . i purchased this product as a replacement for a 15 year old 19 " sony . i was mainly looking for something that was flat panel , a little larger , and could be hooked up to a computer . i am just an average guy looking to replace his very old TV . there are many reviews of this nagging on the picture quality . yes , if you set this next to a unit that costs twice as much , you can tell the difference . i noticed it was not quite as bright , and the colors weren't as brilliant . is it good enough ? yes , certainly . the average user will never notice . this is just an amazing product for the money . i picked it up for $ 899 , and with rebates the cost was $ 699 ! literally , you will pay almost twice as much for competitor products . the detachable speakers are a nice feature . it saved me from having to buy a new entertainment center . the system has L / R and subwoofer audio outputs also , if you need more than the stock speakers . nice addition . i purchased the HVS model , not HV . oddly , the HVS model that i purchased is listed as " not yet available " here on amazon . i believe the difference is that the HVS model is single tuner , where as the HV is dual tuner . not an important difference for me , and i think most people . with digital cable , and required decoder boxes , basic cable tuners aren't so useful .  
2	  The pluck foam works very well . I 'm glad I purchased this case . Recommended .  
1	  Cheap . Not much a wider angle . Don't buy inexpensive stuff when it comes to camera equipment because you get what you pat for .  
1	  i just purchased this play and charge kit from BlueMall and it doesn't even work . when i purchased it i thought it was too good to be true to only be $ 9 when they usually are $ 20 and what do you know it was to good to be true because its not a microsoft product even though it says it is and the battery didnt want to charge . I would not recommend this device because its a waste of money .  
1	  I got this camera January 2006 and I 'm so disappointed with it ! Images are never sharp . I called the manufacturer and they told me trying new sets in the camera . I 've tried so many things and can't get a good image . However , I give it 2 stars because i 've been using the camera as a camcorder , and works pretty as a camcorder ! The other reason why i gave it 2 stars is because two months ago , I dropped and somebody stepped on it and it still works ahahaha it 's amazing ! If you want sharp pictures , do not purchase this camera . I have an older ( 2004 ) SONY DSC-P73 , 4 megapixels and the pictures quality are a LOT BETTER .  
1	  I have a fourth gen , 40GB iPod . These skins are a joke ~ remember when OJ Simpson couldn't fit that glove on his hand during his murder trial ? Same thing here . I have absolutely no doubt that this skin was made for the smaller 20GB iPod and the marketing people at Speck decided to tout it as working for both the 20 and 40GB models . Those models are different sizes ! Okay , so you can get the skin on , but the flap at the bottom which is designed to open so that you can dock your iPod doesn't close all the way , leaving the lower back part of the iPod exposed . In addition , because the skin is so tight it doesn't sit " squarely " on the iPod . The skin is simply too small . I had read this same thing in a review on another site but wanted to make up my own mind . Well , I should have listened .. Personally , I 'd also like to see a thin transparent cover for the iPod 's screen , although I knew this product didn't have that when I bought it . I returned my Speck skin the day after I got it , and my search for a good all-around iPod skin continues ..  
1	  the product description should state what the packaging does , that the unit only provides 500mA at 12V . i wouldn't have purchased if i had known it was so puny . :(  
1	  I would have given this card 4 stars had it not ruined my newly built computer for 4 months . I built a 1350 dollar computer by myself with all the most fancy and nice hardware . On paper my computer should have run super fast like lightning ! However i found myself waiting over 3 minutes to open word files , as cpu uptime got longer it would dramatically slow down performance , and it got to the point where i needed to restart every 3-4 hours . Finally after 4 months of usage i got sick and tired and tested every piece of hardware , software , and driver . Eventually i figured out that it was the X-Fi software that was bundled with the soundcard . A process that was called DLLML was eating up all of my resources and causing all of my frustration . I had to dig into some forums and found out a way to stop this process from running at startup . Now 4 months later i finally have a completely stable and lightning fast system as it should be . Imagine spending 1350 dollars and the computer runs slower than your older cpu . Please beware of this issue , i have no problems with the card it self but the software is just unacceptable . Creative really dropped the ball on this one .  
2	  Received in good condition and delivery was very quick . The unit was easy to set up and easy to use . The picture quality was good and the price was right .  
1	  Bought this for my wife for Christmas and spent time pre-loading photos only to have the keychain break and the frame got lost within 2 weeks ! The buttons are also very cheaply made and didn't work well from the beginning . The photos look good but this is made very cheaply and won't last long at all . I can't even return it because when it broke it got lost !  
2	  In terms of price for the feature-set included with this remote , I don't think you can find a better deal . I 've had the Logitech 880 running my home theater for over a year now and couldn't be happier , but I needed another remote for my bedroom .. the 550 was perfect for it , as I had only a few devices I wanted to control ( including my fan ! ) . For those who are tired of managing multiple remotes ( TV , DVR , Cable Box , DVD Player , etc . ) this line of remotes truly does the job . These are easily configured via an included application , taking only minutes to program your devices exactly how you want ( just know beforehand the model number of your devices , and what devices are on which TV / receiver inputs and you won't even have to leave the computer ) . Basically , if my wife can work my complicated theater set-up with these remotes , anyone can ( my mother really liked them too when she was house sitting ) .  
1	  I expected this to be too good to be true , given the price . It was . Battery only worked for one full charge . Then wouldn't recharge .  
1	  Purchased this a month ago and have been rather unhappy with this product , which gives unstable wireless performance . I was attracted to Netgear by the rebate , and now I regret it . I should have bought a Linksys wireless router / AP instead , I think . My wifi-ready laptop is about 50 feet away from the Netgear router . There are about 4 walls in between , and reception is poor . About 20 % of the time it 's fair , 30 % of the time poor , and 50 % of the time ( when I try to use Internet ) it 's unavailable . This performance is just not acceptable . The manual set is also poorly written . You get two pieces of printed materials : a confusing starter sheet , and an ISP information sheet . Get this : on the printed " get started " sheet it asks you to refer to the manual on the CD-ROM before you should turn your PC back on ! What kind of genius wrote this ? Luckily I 'm a techie so I had no trouble deciphering the non-English guide . The router 's major strength is its cool design , but its poor signal strength means you should probably go with a more established brand like Linksys or D-Link .  
2	  This is obviously made to work with Kodak-branded printer docks and camera docks , so don't buy this paper package if you don't own one or the other . That being said , I STRONGLY recommend getting this 160 package instead of the smaller packages because A ) it ends up being MUCH cheaper when you consider how many more pieces of photo paper and ink you get , and B ) even if you don't print a lot , you 'll use them all up sooner or later . It 's not like they expire , right ? And considering you get free shipping and no sales tax if you order it from Amazon , than the several dollars cheaper than Best Buy price sounds even sweeter !  
1	  I bought this item to hook up my iPod to my factory Nissan radio . I have used several FM Modulators in the past and I have found it to be a relatively easy and inexpensive way to go , until now . After all the adaptors , I spent about $ 100 . I should have gone with one of those icruise ( ? ) units instead for $ 129 . The sound quality is horrible . I 'm no audio geek . I went from a tape adaptor to this and now back to a tape adaptor because it sounds 100 times better . I emailed Pyle and I will see what they say , but even if they offer to fix / replace it , their web site says they want $ 15 for return postage .. You may also want to know that Pyle has discontinued this unit in favor of the PLMD3 .  
1	  they are cables . they work . thats it . they function well and did not set my house on fire . they also did not require a password or a laser .  
2	  I read all the reviews for this and competing products and I am very glad I chose the ATH-ANC7 . I got these for work .. in an office with 4 others .. and they are terrific . Others in the office have Bose QC2 and one of the Bose on-ear models . I A / B 'd them with the Audio-Technica and am very please with my purchase . If you have GREAT hearing , are exceptionally picky about your music and have extra cash to waste then the QC2 are a good choice .. but then again if you are really that picky why are you expecting perfectly balanced , audiophile sound in a noisy environment in the first place ? The QC2 's have a touch more clarity and a bit better bass response , but those minor differences don't justify the extra $ 200 for me . The AT fit good and are comfortable . The ear cushions are replacable .. this is great news having tossed a couple of expensive studio headphones after the cushions rotted out . The sound at low volume is clear and punchy and not fatiguing to your ears .. and after working in a music studio I am well accustomed to fatigued ears . I 'm not particularly found of headphones to begin with but seem to tolerate these well for several hours at a time . Since 99 % of all my listening is through iTunes with everything ripped at 196 or higher ( I can easily hear the sound degradation below 196 ) , I have just EQ 'd the output a bit to compensate for my tastes and everything sounds great . Several others in the office have tried these headphones .. compared to the Bose .. and can no longer justify the price difference . I read some complaints of humming or buzzing . I have experienced no humm but did hear brief buzzing twice for about a second each time . Not sure what the cause was , but honestly haven't lost any sleep over it . These are truly a good purchase if you need to lose the outside world and regain a bit of sanity .  
2	  Great Camera , easy to use , affordable , many manual features . The only thing is the performance on bad light situations . Cannon basic cameras do better than the lumix in that field . The zoom is the best part . And it does great videos also .  
1	  This receiver must have spent a good deal of time on this product in 2 ways : 1 ) to make a very good stereo and 2 ) to make the worst remote and menu system ever devised . The other review spends time explaining the good features of the stereo , so I 'll spend my time explaining what 's wrong with the remote and menu system . First , there are features to the stereo that can only be adjusted using the remote and not the buttons and knobs on the front . So drop your remote or run out of batteries and oh , well , I guess you 'll just have to watch all the big games in Sci-Fi stereo mode . Second , it 's not intuitive at all . I 'm sure that the makers of the product might tell me to find a manual , but good remotes and good web browsers have one thing in common : they should be intuitive enough to use without refering to the manual . It took me 3 months before I figured out how to adjust the volume on individual speakers and now I seem to have gotten it into 6 ch mode and cannot get it back to normal . Arrgghh ! So you 're going to ask me - is it fair that I 've downgraded this item all the way to one star , just because of a remote . Yes . Would you buy a luxury car if it didn't have a cupholder ? I consider it a good lesson for Yamaha : your customers should determine the design of your product , not your engineers . No customer would ever design such a convoluted remote and menu system , but I can imagine a number of engineers that would .  
1	  I 'm not quite sure . I 've bought one in China ( Why ? cause I live there ) . Different model which is called PCG-Z1VCP with WinXP Professional Edition . According to the detail specification and pictures out there , I 'm quite sure it is exactly like this PCG-Z1VA in which the ' A ' refer to America as I supposed . And the price is 17,888 yuan RMB , quite like this one too . So the problem here is that I found the screen colar is frustrating . No matter how I adjust it , the black is never black , the red is never stunning . Espesially , I found it almost impossible to watch DVD movie on it , cause the black is always grey and the contrast is poor no matter how I adjusted the Overlay , when it come to dack scenes , it just big pieces of black which I mean gray . Yes , you can tell who is who . Honestly , this 's my first notebook computer . So maybe it 's always like this for all the notebook LCD out there which you can't compare with Desktop monitor but I do , or it 's just for this type which is not very probable consider it 's a " Sony Style " product . And the most frustrating possibility that most worrys me is that this type of PCG-Z1VCP ( made in Chine ) which I bought is not really like the PCG-Z1VA series which sony made for USA . The same specification and appearance is just a hype and sony made some cut down in qualities which you can't find out through specification ( whenever did a notebook produce , besides screen size and Resolution , list a detail specification about it 's LCD screen like Brightness , Contrast ratio , Color and frequency . Sony by cut down qualities make profits in China while still built up their brand in USA . That 's very tricky , but it happened before . 17.888 yuan for a monthly income about 3,000 yuan ( that 's about 350 dollar ) is not a little amount . I really want to figure out if my money is paid worthfully . As I 've not see any piece of review concerned the screen problem I have . I 've be very appreciate if someone who bought this produce can tell me about it . It will be very relief to know the turth .  
1	  I had the same experience as Wendy in Nebraska . The description is clearly of a computer case , and all I received was a power supply . I complained and Amazon sent me another power supply . I refused it , and will return the first one for a refund . Someone at Amazon should read the reviews and make some corrections . Newell Stallones  
2	  After comparing prices , on-line and locally , I purchased the Polaroid pdv-700 portable dvd player at my local Best Buy store and am very pleased with the quality and the simplicity of the unit-I initially bought it to keep me occupied during a plane trip , but after trying it out a few days ago , I can see that I will be using it at home also-there are several other lesser brands out there , but I prefer to go with a brand name , and since I do own other items that are Polaroid , this was an easy and good decisionfor me to make .  
2	  I 've owned Tivoli Model One 's in the past and was not disappointed with the Model Two . If you want a good , simple , even retro looking radio go with Tivoli . Compared to the over priced plastic Bose radios , Tivoli is a winner for me and I can upgrade it later with a subwoofer and CD if desired . Everyone that has seen mine gets a twinkle in their eye ; and when they hear it pulling in stations up to 75 miles away they get hooked .  
2	  It took about 10 minutes to assemble . No need to read the instructions , it 's pretty obvious . It functions perfectly for DVDs as I am using it for , and you do have one shelf left over if you store all DVDs on it . If you store CDs , then you will have room for the final shelf . No problems with shelves sliding down , and no wobbling . Excellent shelving for DVDs .  
2	  Everything about this pack is great except that the main compartment is a little cramped because of the laptop computer sleeve . I am a student in a professional program and use the pack for transporting books . I can fit 2 textbooks and 1 2 " binder in the main compartment if I do not carry a laptop . I would like the option of removing the laptop sleeve if I could design the pack myself . All of the other compartments carry everything that I could ever want . Also I could use this for travel . The wheels are sturdy as is the handle . Its relatively light weight and keeps the weight off of your back . Overall I would recommend this pack to anyone or recommend the JanSport Big Student pack if you don't mind carrying the load on your back .  
1	  Don't believe the picture ! This does NOT come in a Brother retail box , and the cartridges don't even have the Brother brand name on it . Looks like third-party ink , NOT BROTHER . Will be returning my order ! :(  
1	  This camera does not work with Adobe Premiere Elements 1.0 . I repeat .. this camera does not work with Adobe Premiere Elements 1.0 . After days of troubleshooting and a potentially $ 39 phone call to Adobe , their tech help put it simply . He said , " That camera records in MPEG-2 . Adobe Premiere Elements doesn't like MPEG-2 . You need to try converting your MPEG-2 's to AVI files before bringing them into Adobe Premiere Elements . " Well , I 'm working on that , but so far , no luck . Despite the fact that my computer has enough hard drive space , plenty of RAM , has been defragged , etc . etc . , the picture is still jumpy and there 's no sound . Instead of editing videos , I 'm now hunting all over the web for file conversion programs that work with the DVD201 and Adobe Premiere Elements . Not fun and it 'll probably cost me . I will say that this camera 's touch screen is very intuitive and fun to use . Overall , the camera is easy and fun to use , but if you have any delusions of video editing , stick with the older Mini-DV cameras . Also , the software that came with this camera is AWFUL .  
1	  I was willing to pay extra bucks thinking Microsoft make better product but after 2 months of use , still I was disappointed mostly because of their voice software that triggers each time you touch the top button witch can be easyly done by accident . And there is no way to disactivated it . Finally I sold it on Ebay and bougth a less expensive Creative Live Cam Notebook Pro that works 10 times better . Lesson learn : " Big names don't always make better products but usually cost good dollars . "  
2	  WOW ! Are these really supposed to be less than 40 bucks ? The sound is amazingly full , from classical to jazz to rock . Playing Elgar 's Enigma Variation I could hear the distinct sound of each instrument , from the treble to bass , nothing but clean crisp sound . Chopin 's piano was nothing short of heaven on these headphones . Playing some jazz saxophone , I could hear the player breath ! I have never heard that in this track when I was listening to it all the previous times . Also , you can heard where each note begins and ends , even when the sax part was soft and blanketed by the accompanyment . Moving over to my favorite rock bands , again , deep bass and crisp sound . In summary , unless you want to spend 150 + bucks on some closed and bulky headphones , you won't be able to find anything better than these headphones . And if your budget is under 50 , I don't see how you can choose any other headphone .  
2	  Maybe I 'm a printer-holic : I have an Epson Photo R200 for photos . I have a Primera Signature Z6 for CDs ( fantastic printer , by the way ) . But I needed a fast , reliable printer for handouts and training materials . I work in Illustrator and InDesign , and PostScript Level 3 was critical . This printer is genuine Adobe PostScript ( not " PretendScript " like other printers ) , and it shows . But , beyond that , the entire experience is superior : the manufacturing standards are splendid ( great fit and finish ! ) , and the set-up guide is perfect-you can't go wrong . The little ink sticks are shape-coated so that even a trained squirrel could load them . The " walk-up installation " that finds Windows boxes and says " hello " automatically is wonderful . It 's speedy , sharp and chock full of great features I didn't know I 'd love . I highly recommend this printer !  
2	  I am a long time palm user . First the Palm IIC , then the Palm m500 , then the Sony Clie SJ-22 and now the Sony Clie SJ-33 . I have been using this SJ-33 since May of 2004 when I got it on a closeout sale for $ 149 . It was the best deal on electronics I have ever received . I love the fact that I can sync outlook , word and excel documents . It helps with my work as an engineer greatly . The other thing that is great about this little handheld is that the Dragonball processor has more than enough juice to play movies . Little known fact about this handheld is that you can burn dvd 's ( using PocketDVD ) and then convert them to . pdb format using Kinoma Producer 3 to watch full length movies on this palm . As far as I know it is the only pre Palm OS5 device that has the horsepower to do this . Granted , you have to buy PocketDVD and Kinoma Producer , and I recommend a 256Meg memory card to hold one movie but even with these costs you get the functionality of a much newer machine . The battery life is excellent , especially compared to my old IIc and m505 . I have a seperate memory stick that I use to listen to MP3 's on this palm , that functionality is great as well . I take it to the gym in the morning and I either listen to MP3 's or I watch a Seinfeld episode or 2 while I am on the stair master . There is enough battery life to watch two entire movies on one charge ( with the brightness set to the middle ) . I already know that I will be using this PDA until it breaks and goes into the trash can . Pros : - Excellent multimedia capabilities-Jog dial , if you have never had one , you need one ! - long battery life , and it is replaceable-very rugged construction , I have dropped it from waist level several times and aside from some scratches , no internal damageCons : - You have to buy third party software to get full functionality-Sony support is dwindling since they have exited the US-PDA market-I wish the memory card slot would ' lock ' , when I have accidentally dropped it on the ground the memory card literally launches out of the slot , going several feet away  
1	  I read the reviews and bought one anyway , which was my mistake . It was brand new and like the review said the volume cut out completely at low settings . Never mind the possibility of the batteries leaking the sound from this unit is way too bright ; meaning it has far too much treble . The button functions also do not make sense . Buy a Logitech Pure-Fi Anywhere ( I did ) or an Altec Lansing IM9 .  
1	  The SD1000 's gone back . Lack of sharpness in the pictures-and it 's a 7M camera .. I noticed it when I started playing around with it . There 's a fairly-complex group of settings , so I thought the problem might be there . However , after getting things set right , and the picture set for its highest resolution ( 3072x2304 , ) I tried a comparison test with my Oly C5050Z . That 's a 5M camera , and the best JPG resolution I use is 2560x1920 . Subject was some books on a shelf , using the flash . My Oly was marginally better . So the SD1000 's been returned ( Amazon does make it easy , ) and the search has begun anew ..  
1	  I purchased this cassette tape deck primarily to use in transferring music from cassette tapes to CDs . The one essential feature I needed was missing ; it had no input for earphones . I returned the deck to Amazon .  
1	  I wish I had an explanation for why these headphones fail after just a few weeks of routine use . I 'm currently on my fourth pair , which just conked out today , and I 've had exactly the same problem with every one : suddenly , for no apparent reason , the satellite reception just stops . The display on my Pioneer Inno XM receiver shows the message " check antenna " or " no signal . " And that 's it - no more satellite radio . ( The headphones continue to work for playback of recorded music , so it 's just the satellite reception function that 's problematic . ) Naturally I 've contacted Belkin customer service , and so far they 've replaced each defective pair without charge , but the hassle and inconvenience of having to pack up the old pair and ship it back to them , and then having to wait two or three weeks for the new pair to arrive is getting old - very old . And what 's annoying is the Belkin customer service reps I 've spoken to on the phone claim they 're not aware of any problem with the product . Unfortunately , there don't seem to be any alternatives . No one else makes anything similar . If anyone has figured out what the problem is with these things , I 'd certainly like to know !  
1	  The Pentax Optio 550 5MP was light and easy to use , but I was unimpressed with the image quality . My daughter 's 3MP Kodak produced sharper pictures . The image quality may have been better if sufficient memory had been included with the camera to store pictures at a high resolution setting . The16MB memory card included with the camera did not have sufficient space for even one shot at the highest resolution setting .  
1	  Allow me to save you some time by simply saying that I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers about the poor navigation and control with this hardware . This is the piece of information I would like to add : I used this device for almost six months before it quit on me completely . It won't even turn on anymore ; it just stays at the title screen and does not load the music . I know this could have been a very isolated incident , but a friend of mine also bought this same product , and has experienced the same outcome . Please , save yourself some time and money when it comes to the Zen Neeon , and pass it by .  
1	  This crossover cut out the mid-range . My music sounded very " empty " , it was nothing but weak highs and muddy lows . After a month , and thinking that it was the speakers that were making the music sound bad , i unplugged the crossover and hooked the rca 's from the head unit straight to the amps . The sound was perfect . I suggest , don't waste your money on this , and use the built in crossovers on your amps . I 'm not even going to resell mine , i 'm just throwing it away . I wouldn't wish that kind of sound on anybody .  
1	  PROS * Good looking hardware * Small size ideally suited for travel and handheld use * Unique turn exclusion screen allows you to select multiple roads you want to avoid with ease * Lots of routing options ( including fast car , slow car , pedestrian , & scenic route ) * POI brand icons displays company logos on the map instead of generic POI category icons * Music player supports MP3 , AAC , and WMA audio formats * Relatively long ( 5 hour ) battery life * Includes swappable white and black faceplates * NAVTEQ mapping data ( 2006 maps ) * SiRF 's high performance StarII indoor GPS receiver * Light weight ( 3.9 oz ) * Nicely designed map screenCONS * Poor documentation * Cluttered , complex UI * Very sluggish / slow . Borders on unusable * When entering an address , pressing the " Back " icon takes you back to the main menu rather than the previous menu , and you have to start entering the address all over again * Couldn't find some addresses - quirky address entry system * Small screen size and small text combined with general slowness makes the Pocket LOOX N100 all but impossible to use while driving * Highly reflective screen difficult to see in many lighting conditions * No Text-to-Speech ( GPS doesn't announce actual street names ) * Voice prompts sound strange - like a drunk woman reading a seductive romance novel ( seriously ) * When using the MP3 player while navigating , audio prompts are announced over the music , making them difficult to hear . Some other GPS units pause the music for audio navigation prompts , and then resume music playback . * User interface needs refinement - some tasks are especially frustrating , such as entering a destination address * Voice Regocnition feature more gimmick than useful feature * No BluetoothConclusionI had hoped the Pocket LOOX would become the GPS I travel with - it 's good loox ( sorry , I couldn't help it ) and small size would have made it ideal for bringing it with me on trips and carrying it around in my pocket . Plus , the mp3 player , video player , and video games would have made it an even better travel companion . Fujitsu Siemens Pocket LOOX N100Unfortunately , the Fujitsu Siemens Pocket LOOX N100 ( seriosuly , not only is this the least catchy product name ever , but the unit I reviewed actually included a legal requirement that I refer to the product by it 's full , un-marketing firendly , name in this review ) is ruined by poor performance and its unpolished user interface . The single biggest problem with the Pocket LOOX is the overall slowness of the unit . Using this frustratingly sluggish GPS for any length of time is an exercise in patience . For example , it takes a full minute for the navigation application to load . Entering text is so slow that you constantly double-hit letters because your not sure if the unit registered the first tap . It 's not that any one aspect of using the Pocket LOOX is slow - it 's that EVERY aspect of the Pocket LOOX is slow , from navigating menus to redrawing maps . Performance is so poor that the Pocket LOOX is almost unusable . Then there 's the size issue - the Pocket LOOX has a small screen , so it 's all the more essential that software engineers make intelligent use of the screen . Instead , it feels like Navigon 's software was designed for larger display GPS devices and simply transferred onto the palm-sized Pocket LOOX without any adjustments . The small text is unreadable from the drivers seat ( and almost unreadable even at arms length ) , and the menus feel cluttered . The on-screen keyboard is much too small , and almost impossible to use with normal sized fingers . The screen is also highly reflective , making it difficult to see in many situations . I also had difficulty entering in addresses . Frequently the Pocket LOOX would be unable to find an address until I found an alternate input method , such as entering the street name first , or using a zip code or cross street . Browsing through street names is tedious as you have to scroll one line at a time and wait for the small text box to scroll for each line before you can see the entire street name ( assuming you can find the destination street at all ) . Pocket LOOX ships with NAVTEQ mapping data , but was unable to find addresses or POIs that other NAVTEQ-powered GPS devices find without issue . Pocket LOOX does manage to squeeze in some innovative features , such as Brand Icons , displaying highway road signs , speed limit notification , and many vehicle profile options ( there 's even a " scenic route " profile ) . However , overall the Pocket LOOX is too slow , too complicated , and the text layout is too small . Given the relatively high $ 500 price tag , I also felt the Pocket LOOX should have included Bluetooth and Text-to-Speech . Oh , and did I mention it was slow ?  
2	  I 've used a number of different branded switches . This d-Link product has performed flawlessly ! I coupled this with a d-Link router and both prove to be great products ! You can't go wrong with d-Link .  
2	  I 'm a Mac user ( iBook running OS X 10.2.5 ) connecting to the ' net over DSL . I found this router quite easy to configure . I 've been using it for a couple of months now with nary a hitch . The best thing about it is that it costs about a third the price of one of Apple 's Airport base stations . That 's the great thing about standards ( in this case , 802.11b ) , we Mac users get to take advantage of the greater level of competition on the PC hardware side !  
2	  I needed several of these cases for my workplace , but I was a little uneasy ordering this site unseen over the internet . I was extremely pleased with the product . It appears to be very sturdy and should with stand rainy weather .  
2	  I got it a bout 3 weeks back . The processor speed with 1GB memory give it lightening speed compare to my older machine ( Thinkpak Z60 ) . Small size , but big enought screen to do all things I need . After carrying around 5.1 lb for a year , and this 4.3 lb machine seems to cure many of my muscle pain . The color is good , the body looks and feel like a tank ( but don't drop it just because I said so ) . Got USB on both sizes , which is great . The 2 things that a bit poor are ( 1 ) touch pad is a bit difficult to use , the buttoms are too flat and the touch pad seems to sit inside , not easy to click ( I am used to that littke button mouse at the middle of the keyboard ) : bought a wireless mouse , and solve that problem . ( 2 ) build in speaker is poor quality , but hey that seems to be the standard for all other laptop except those that are 7lb + size : got a head phone and solve this issue as well . So , overall , at almost half price against other compareable machine , this is the best buy I have had for a while .  
2	  I 've had this table for over 6 months now and it 's one of my favorite prized possessions because it is so convenient and I 'm so glad I found it . I am way more than satisfied with this table , it looks very nice and I 've never had a problem with anything about it and I use the adjustments pretty regularly . I would definitely buy another one if it wasn't so expensive . It is one of the most convenient things I have ever owned , I use it to eat on over my bed and tilt the table top and put my book on it to study , if you study in bed a lot this is awesome for that . I managed to put it together by myself but if you have help around you 'll definitely want it , assembly on this is more of a 2 person job , but can be done by 1 with some frustration . I would never part with this wonderful table and have never found another wooden one like it anywhere else .  
1	  I bought this CF card for my canon powershot S400 after reading some reviews of people that recommend it for canon digital cameras and because of the price , I was really disappointed from the beginning about its speed comparing it to my other CF card ( lexar 12X 256 ) , when u take a picture ( u don't get the picture u took when the flash lights but the one after about two second , so people should not move for a few second after u took the picture ) , despite that I kept it because I didn't wanna bother returning it back , then came what really piss me off , after less than 3 weeks the card brook down completely ( I only used it twice ) and I 'm getting error message reading the card in my camera , even I can't get the pictures that I took , simpletech will replace it but I had to pay for shipping ( $ 7.50 for FedEx ) , I could have returned it to amazon . com for full refund ( because it 's been less than 30 days since I bought it ) but I didn't have the UPC code ( which amazon . com requires for returning an item ) for my package which I had to send it for the $ 15 mail-in-rebate ( which simpletech requires within 2 week from purchase date to qualify for the mail-in-rebate ) I don't know may be they do that to prevent u from returning it . I 'm really disappointed with this card and I advice people not to be cheap and purchase the cheapest 512MB card they can get , lexar 512 12X cost probably $ 15 dollars more but u 'll not hear anybody complaining about its speed or breaking down , that difference u 'll pay it in shipping costs if the card breaks down twice , not counting the lost pictures which are priceless .  
1	  I couldn't find any info on whether this reader could or could not read miniSDHC . It can't . At least not the 4GB card I have which is brand new . Too bad for my treo .  
2	  If you like tiny mp3 players then this is probably the best one out there . The set up was easy . I use the Real One player with the Panasonic add-on to transfer files . I don't care about features like FM radios , etc . so this player has all the features I need . I haven't had any problems transferring MP3 and WMA files that I have downloaded or ripped . The sound quality is good and it is definitely loud enough . I love being able to stuff it in my pocket so it is available when I need it . The playing time is a big plus too . I usually get more than 8 hours off the rechargeable battery and about a week of use if I use the carrier with the AA-battery . With SD card prices slowly dropping , I 've been buying 256MB SD cards so I can get hours of songs on a single card . The only complaint I have is that sometimes the display gets out of sync with what is actually playing .  
2	  I bought two of these a couple of years ago , and have been very satisfied . In fact late last year I bought a third pair to have an extra one around . These are very portable , light , good optics , convenient to hold and use , appear well-made and have held up well travelling . Of course , if you 're looking for something to use very early morning or late evening , you 'll probably want something like a much bulkier and heavier 7 X 50 . One of the best features is that after once adjusting the right hand lens , you can use the center knob to focus both sides . This works best if you don't have to share it with people who need a different adjustment , which is why we keep so many around , with tags attached to identify whose they are .  
2	  Bought this for my new flash camcorder . Had it for 2 months , took it to the Bahamas and back .. worked flawlessly . Great value , would recommend to others .  
2	  If you don't want to spend $ 80 or more on the professional-grade stuff , this backpack serves the amateur very well . Plenty of room & dividers for your gear , and two outside pockets for stowing your favorite lens ( or water bottles ) .  
1	  First HP does not include a backup copy of the XP software unless you buy the system directly from HP . Also HP recovery system takes up to 17 GB of hard drive space . Which deduces the stated drive space . After being passed around the HP customer service , 7 persons and five different phone numbers , I have come to the conclusion that I will never buy a HP or compaq computer even if it was the only computer aviable and it was free .  
2	  This webcam does everything a similarly priced Creative Labs one didn't . I LOVE IT . 1 . Hardware . Is wide angle enough so captures more than whole face at normal 2 to 3 foot distances . Does an Excellent job in poor light . Is Autofocus . Is higher resolution than other similarly pricedwebcams by Creative Labs ( 2 Megapixel , vs 1.2 Megapixel ) . 2 . Drivers - Color tint was always perfect , and no adjustment needed . 3 . Software - Easy Install , Allows one to zoom the image if desired . 4 . Instructions - Either clips to monitor or mounts on ( supplied ) 11 inch tall plastic stick with base . On a Macintosh , no software needed , it 's natively supported on OS X 10.5 and 10.6 , whith sharp image , and prefect color . Not quite as good as ( more expensive ) Stand-alone external Apple iSight Camera , but half the price ; and this camera works on both Macintosh and Windows platforms , which iSight doesn't . Drivers available for 64 bit Windows 7 .  
1	  One has to apply a lot of pressure when labeling a disk . Even when that is done , the colors look faint . Buyers Beware !  
1	  My husband bought this filter to protect our 70-200 f / 2.8 , lens and the second time we used the lens the filter broke . Didn't hit it on anything that would create the break , very disappointed in this filter , would never buy this brand again , lesson learned !  
1	  This cable has a horrendous design flaw . The cable is snagless , so there 's a piece of white plastic that covers the little clear plastic pin that secures the cable once connected . The problem ? You would assume this small plastic cover is made out if a flexible material , so it can be depressed when you need to unplug the cable right ? Not rocket science , it 's just a piece of flexible white plastic right ? Guess what .. It isn't . The material it 's made of is hard as a rock . Once the cable was plugged in , and I tried to depress this thing because I needed to unplug and reposition the cable , and this thing wouldn't budge at all . You press it so hard your fingertips hurt and IT WON'T BEND AT ALL . I even tried using pliers to no avail . Who designed this thing ? Now , the cable is perpetually hooked onto the switch port I plugged it in and it simply can't be unplugged . I never imagined someone could mess up something as simple as a CAT6 cable but guess what . They managed to do so . The performance of the cable is pretty much what was expected in case your wondering . Just know that wherever you plug this cable , it will still remain , long after humans no longer inhabit the earth .  
2	  I have had my new Palm m515 for just over a week now and it is truly outstanding and a significant improvement over my old Palm Vx ( this is my third palm ) . It handles the basics with the classic Palm efficiency and as a business professional , my ability to access a 3000 plus contact list as well as schedule is my top priority . I was concerned about the screen visibility based upon reviews I read but these proved baseless in my opinion . In all lighting conditions ( office , car , outdoors .. ) the screen is clearly legible , although I do set mine to high brightness . Noticeable is the considerably increased speed over the Vx . I am also using the Dictionary-Thesaurus Expansion Card that is a welcome addition and is already getting significant use . The only draw back is with the color display , battery time has decreased substantially and it needs to spend more time in the cradle , a hassle when traveling . Note to Palm : increase the battery capacity ! All in all the m515 maintains Palms position as near and dear to my heart as the best PDA out there .  
1	  I owned this product for a VERY short period of time and it completely stopped functioning . I contacted TrendNet and they happily offered to exchange it , and the 2nd one also went out after a few weeks . Their response ? They 'd be happy to send me another one . I work in our firm 's Technology Department and I 've never seen quality KVM switches go back this fast . They product is shoddy and Amazon should consider dropping it .  
1	  Have had this for two weeks . Loved it at first but the band is ripping from the metal screws in the back . Shame because it is a perfect fit ..  
2	  I just bought one of these from Best Buy , and the cd had both XP and Max software on it . The software is kind of ghetto looking , and the " Upload completely ! " message indicates that there was obviously not much software quality control , but it works . The only thing , if you unplug the keychain while the software is up , and you forgot a picture so you replug it in while the software is still open , the download will not work . You will have to close the software and reopen it once you have reconnected and selected " usb update " . I got this as a gift for my fiancee 's mother , so I hope it 'll hold out until Xmas ( 8 days to go ) . Will update if I find a problem with it . Otherwise , everything is working and the pictures uploaded fine . Also cheaper and less bulky looking than the ones at Sharper Image and Brookstone ( probably less quality with this one , but my mother-in-law to be is scared of technology , so if she doesn't use it $ 30 is much less to be upset over than $ 60 ) .  
1	  I had the 5K ( 5 MP ) model of this camera which was stolen . However , I have added three or four other digital zoom cameras to my collection which were better suited to my use since then , so when I got this I was disappointed . First , there is no external hotshoe for flash , the camera is small compared to the others I own . I simply found that I had outgrown this size camera . It simply pales in comparison with my Canon 5SIS and my Fuji Finepix S9000 , so I returned it immediately . A less advanced amateur might find it perfect for them , though .  
1	  I left behind my D-link DWL 132 ( 108 mbps ) when I was on vocation which work great for me over a year . After read all the reviews , I decided to give this one ( WUSB54GS a try ) . The signal range was dispointed ( D-Link DWL132 have much better range ) . Setup with push button with Linksys Secure Easy Setup is easy with Linksys router , BUT I lost connection on my other Laptop PC which is not Linksys wireless adapter . I go back to re-setup my laptop than this adapter on desk top lost connection because of changing setting on the linksys router . One way or another , I spend 4 hours still unable to make both adapters work with Linksys 54g router .  
1	  Warning . These Binder Insert Pages fit only the matching HandStands binders . The hole pattern does not fit a standard 3-ring binder . I wanted to put note pages along with the CDs , so this product will not work for that application . Also , the inside corners are tapered so that you cannot just punch 2 more holes in the right spot .  
2	  This is my second mouse for my laptop . My first Microsoft wireless still works , but the turn on switch gets stuck and it just got annoying . Other than that , this is a good size for a laptop . It is full sized enough to feel comfortable for hours of use but not too bulky to fit in a laptop case . I really like the ease of plug in . Just take the USB from the back of the mouse , plug it in , and you are set to go . The battery life has been great and I use my laptop every day , mostly all day . My battery on the first mouse would last several months , so I am hoping for the same from this configuration . I would not normally buy Microsoft peripherals , but I wouldn't trust any other wireless mouse with my laptop after using this for 18 months .  
2	  I 've had my Kingston drive for about a year now . It 's in my pocket with my keys and change all the time except when the drive is plugged into a computer . Unlike other flash drives I 've had , the Kingston shows little wear from this treatment . I have not run into any hardware or software compatibility issues . It 's worked in every ( Windows ) computer that I 've plugged it into . It 's pretty compact ; I can plug the drive into a middle USB port and not physically block the ports above or below it - which is a problem I 've had with other drives . I use the drive to keep items that I 'm working on so I can work on them from either home or work . Summary : The drive capacity is big , plays well with other hardware and software , and it 's sturdy . If it were not noticeably slower than other flash drives I 've had , I 'd give it five stars . However , the lack of speed is not a huge deal in the long run . It 's just a little slower doing writes than faster ( and more expensive ) drives . - BillPS : Some have mentioned about the cap potentially getting lost . That is not an issue to me , as I 've found that the cap will securely snap on the other end of the drive when you take it off ..  
2	  This is one of the best purchase decisions I ever made . I can take it back and forth between my house , car and office . It works great - just put the antenna in a position to catch the satellite signal . Takes five minutes to set up and you have hours of pleasure listening to broadcasts without any advertising . It 's easy to contact the XM people also and you are ready to go within about 10 minutes of subscribing . Could not be better - I recommend it highly .  
1	  Not much better than an old cheap transistor radio in sound quality . I bought it to listen to CDs at bedtime , but I can't bear to hear music on it . A very regrettable purchase . I 'm replacing it asap .  
1	  The product is great - works like a charm .. but OOPS ! It doesn't come with cables ! No wonder it was such a great deal . You are better off finding one that comes with all the appropriate cables unless you have them already .  
1	  noise on the receiver , touch lamp goes off and on when on phone , phone rings when talking on other phone  
1	  Unfortunately I bought this camera elsewhere also and payed much more for mine . There is a reason that they have LOWERED their prices ( to meet there LOW Quality ! ) This camera has serious wiring issues - too many connections to get fowled . I only owned it one year and it has been sent to the shop twice ( in the shop more than on the boat ) - and is still there . The service is ABOMINABLE - they currently can't locate the camera that I shipped them in August ( now December ) - despite having USPS confirmation and assigned repair number . ( The two people with whom I have had contact in regards to the problems have also been very rude ! ) I would highly recommend looking into the Sea Viewer camera line before wasting your money on this JUNK !  
2	  Great product , pretty easy to put together and hang ( even for a girl ) . Highly recommended .  
1	  This product does a fairly good job of recording over the air or satellite analog programming , except for some of the strange problems you can run into using a dish receiver I have had little problems on Dish or DirecTV with standard programs . But this device will NOT control an external receiver for anything but Satellite reception and it will never support HDTV reception regardless of weather you wish to record at the lower level of recording . It will never support digital local stations at all . All local stations are handled thru it 's local receiver and it doesn't do Digital . While there is support for Satellite based digital coming , regardless of what they name the DVR it will not be support directly or indirectly by TiVo . Because of that there is no upgrade from TiVo for digital . I own one of these and it 's not worth much now that I have more local digital stations then analog stations and I can only really get a reasonable signal on digital because of my location . In fact I haven't been able to find any supporter of local Digital Recording on any receiver or DVR . I made the mistake of buying a really good receiver and I can watch them but no programming to schedule recordings with so the feature is useless . Oh , and don't expect the Digital TiVo to work with local Digital stations on a local Antenna , it probably won't even list them and it certainly won't record them because it will be maintained by some provider like DirecTV that has no interest in supporting their competition , and they have stated they will not support any channel not transmitted over their satellite .  
2	  This power supply is exactly what was described , works well , and hasn't given me any problems . Nothing notable , but fast shipping and a good product . Strongly recommend .  
2	  Couldnt ' resist that one . For all intents and purposes this is a new HP 700 series printer , The original cartridges were next to empty but still workable and when refilled work like new . My hat 's off to the seller and for an excellent price and prompt shipping and for a workhorse printer that may well last many years yet . A tip : I think these printers like to be kept at least one-half filled with paper - good for the paper pick up mechanism .  
1	  Even though this router is cheap , its a nightmare to maintain once you own it . I purchased it to replace my DI-614 + which I thought was a decent product . As it turns out I have switched back to the DI-614 + due to the DI-524 's terrible reliability . I have had to reset it almost daily because it crashes frequently causing my entire network to go down . The DHCP server completely fails to assign ip addresses on the LAN under most circumstances and so IP addresses must be manually set on each computer connected to the network . It also has a tendency to prevent certain network functions from working properly such as Microsoft file and printer sharing . Dlink tech support is terrible and when they can't figure out whats wrong they tell you they will replace the product , the catch is that you have to pay for shipping which is going to cost you more than the router did in the first place , plus they want a credit card number to bill you with if they determine the product is not defective , ( they will bill you the list price of $ 69.99 ) so its a big risk to try to have it replaced .  
1	  Presto 01362 6-Quart Stainless Steel Pressure CookerThis cooker is my 3rd Presto ( Made in China ) of this style cooker , the others lasted for 20 years each ! ( Made in USA ) The first time I used this one , it was hard to adjust the lid to shut , I should have returned it , instead for almost 4 years I have constantly & each time used a screwdriver to tighten the handle of the cooker so that the lid will seat itself , also - I have to stand nearby & jiggle the lid until it seats once pressure is up , then play with the valves . I know it is past time for a return - but it is a faulty item from the first time I used it , & Presto should know that their new design is shoddy & old time user is very unhappy & will not be buying or recommending this style anymore to younger cooks . I am a cooking teacher & influence hundreds of new cooks . Presto should be ashamed for producing this item in China - they can do better ! My next one is going to be either the other Presto style ( deluxe ) or a Kuhn Rikon Duromatic , made in Switzerland .  
2	  the product works great with my psp which i use as my primary mp3 player . however when my friend tries using his mp3 player it does not work . i am still satisfied with the product due to the fact that it works with my device . so for the price you are paying i think it is worth purchasing .  
1	  i doesnt come complete for charge you have to buy an extra adapter for charge  
2	  These brackets were exactly what I needed . I can now fit 6 drives into a case designed for 4 . 6TB looks great on any system !  
2	  We bought this camcorder because we were going on Vacation to Disneyland and our other camcorder would not work . This camcorder is so much better than our other one was . When ever you moved the old camcorder to get various shots , it had to refocus , which took a few minutes . This one does not need to refocus . This camcorder is a little bit heavier than our old one , but it is easier to use . And the better quality makes up for the weight difference . This is a very good product and I will recomend it to a lot of people .  
1	  Sure I 'm an " L " snob I suppose , but I wanted to try the Tamron to see if I could just carry one lens on an upcoming trip . The lack of sharpness and ability to focus in a rather large depth of field were among the short list of things I didn't like right away . I shot pictures at a wedding for a friend .. and was VERY disapointed . This morning , I tried one more experiment , catching a blue jay out in our oak tree . Could hardly tell the blue jay from the tree at 70 mm . It was just a black blob . I pulled out the L and did the same shot with crystal clarity . The lens is easy to use , light weight , and as others have said .. if you don't require the sharpness .. it is a perfect lens for the price .  
1	  As soon as I plug it into my juke to listen to music , it just goes to the voice commands menu . Waste of money .  
2	  I just got the camera 3 days ago and did my first headshots today . Awsome ! Great camera . Happy client . Fast work flow . I was torn between the Canon D60 and the Nikon . And to be honest went with Nikon because it was the one that was available for my shoot - But no regrets . Great camera .  
2	  I HAVE OWNED A BOSE SOUND DOCK FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS , AND THIS CHRISTMAS GAVE IT AS A GIFT . THE FAMILY I GAVE IT TO WAS THRILLED WITH THE SOUND AND HOW SMALL IT IS . THEY HAD A CLUMPY OLD SOUND SYSTEM AND ARE EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THE SYSTEM . THE SOUND IS EXCELLENT . AS GOOD AS MANY VERY LARGE UNITS .  
2	  The case is wonderful , sleek , well fitted . The screen protector is useful and the arm band is sturdy . Anyone who has a zen should get one of these .  
2	  This is a great little camera . It is small , well constructed , easily transportable and feature-laden . With 3.34 mega pixels , its image quality revivals 35 mm ; although I still think my high-end nikkor lenses and SLR are better . However , the image quality from this camera is quite good . Additionally , you can see the image after you take it . If unacceptable , you delete it and take it again . Gone are the days of finding out someone 's eyes were closed at the moment the shutter snapped and the days of needing to take multiple pictures of the same thing to be sure that one good picture is obtained . The zoom is improved over the Coolpix 990 , and its possible to zoom after you take the picture , so you can crop the image in the camera after it is obtained . The macro mode is particularly sharp and easy to use . By most reports , the pop up flash is insufficient and needs to be supplemented in instances where true flash is needed . However , the pop up flash has worked well for my needs ( mostly " snapshots " of people . ) In automatic mode , the camera will choose very slow shutter speeds at low light levels and objects suffer from motion blur . You need to use the pop up flash in situations where you would just be using faster film and no flash in an SLR . Although obvious , if you are accustomed to film , digital offers the distinct advantage that images are free once the camera is purchased . For the hobbyist , this aids creativity since you are able to take a lot of pictures and experiment , without being inhibited by having to pay for film or processing . There are some accessories you need , so the camera is more of an investment than merely the purchase price . You probably need to purchase a larger memory card than the one supplied . Although images can be stored on your computer , if you are taking a lot of pictures without access to your computer ( i.e. , if you are going on a long vacation ) , you may need multiple cards , or something called a digital wallet which allows thousands of images to be stored on a small , portable hard drive . Although these accessories are useful and easily available , they aren't cheap . My older digital camera did not nearly come close to being able to replace my film cameras . This one does . While my allegiance the film is hard to break , this is now my favorite camera . I highly recommend it .  
2	  I got this camera from my husband for Christmas , and after a little reading , I was using it like a pro . It 's my first digital , and I love it . The software is easy to use , and it couldn't be simpler to download the pictures from the camera to my computer . The pictures are great , very clear . The rechargable batteries are a must . If you want a fantastic mid-priced digital , this is it . Olympus makes a great product . I have one of their 35mm 's and the digital did not let me down !  
2	  I got this JVC video tape player a long time ago and guess I paid about $ 100 for it back then . It 's the only VCR we have now that still works and don't eat up VHS tapes . I got it because of the S / Video and I can play are old VHS tapes with S / Video to a DVD recorder S / Video input to save are old VHS tapes to DVD . With the way are other VCR 's are not working and messing up VHS tapes it is very good to get them saved to DVD and this is about the best way using S / Video . - Raymond Day  
1	  Despite being on the market for many months , the add ons that are supposed to make this a truly useful machine are still not available . There is no memory add on : with decent quality mp3 's you will have less than 30 min play time . There is no fm tuner . The machine is very fragile and the parts come apart with any rough handling . Rio continues to show hostile disregard for its clientele . Avoid this turkey .  
1	  Unit lasted exactly 98 days . Unit now completely inactive . Service repair a joke .. they need 3 months to handle the repair .  
1	  On the HP Photo Value Pack , the package states 24 cents per photo . The package includes 150 sheets of photo paper . 24 cents x 150 sheets equals $ 36.00As I write this , the price above is listed as : List Price : $ 47.15Price : $ 35.99You Save : $ 11.16 ( 24 %) The " list price " of 47.15 would not add up to . 24 cents per photo ! I always understood the list price to be set by the manufacturer ( HP ) , which in this case would not match the promotional packaging ( also HP ) The Amazon " sale " price of 35.99 , should be the list price . I hope this is not deception on the part of Amazon . ~ ~ ~ I have found that these HP Photo Value Packs are subject to some deceptive marketing on the web because buyers understandably think that they are getting standard volume ink cartridges in the deal . Also on a popular auction site , The HP Photo Value Packs are opened , and the 150 sheets of photo paper , and ink cartridge sets sold separately . So although they are genuine HP ink , some believe that they are buying standard full cartridges . The ink in the HP Photo Value Packs are " custom " cartridges , meaning they are filled with only enough ink to print 150 photos . The standard HP individual cartridge ( from the HP website ) : HP 02 Light Cyan Ink Cartridge ( C8774WN # 140 ) , andHP 02 Light Magenta Ink Print Cartridge ( C8775WN # 140 ) , are listed at 240 photos . So without the original box , you can not easily know if you are buying a much lower volume of ink . Beware of sellers ~ Amazon or auctions who may let you believe that the ink tanks you are buying are the standard full ones . Here is a clue to watch for in auctions where sellers have the unboxed ( but individually sealed ) sets of ink : The sets from opened HP Photo Value Packs will have 6 tanks . If Black is included in the set , ask questions , it may be from a HP Photo Value Pack . Black is often sold separately , for example , 5 tanks in this HP Combo Pack : HP 02 Inkjet Print Cartridge Color Combo Pack ( CC604FN # 140 ) ~ John  
2	  This is a great way to add European Maps to your Nuvi . Simply insert the SD Media Card into the Card Slot on your Garmin and thats it . Does not tie up memory space on your Garmin . A great addition for anyone who will be going to Europe . Great program with fast and relGarmin n & uuml ; vi 260W 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigatoriable delivery . I would give this 5 Stars *  
1	  Worked fine for 3 days although it was irritating that you can not add folders to the data directory for storing text files etc . Then it would not power up at all . Tried to recharge but it was dead and I sent it back . Gonna try the Creative Muvo T200 next - similar music and radio features but is supposed to be recognized as a standard HD for data transfer . Hopefully I 'll have better luck with that .  
1	  I can not believe it is from SONY . With the full chage , it only took about 19 pictures in my Canon 560 camera before it showed change battery and the camera shut itself off .  
2	  This is not the newest model on the market , however it works and priced right . Now I wait to see how long it lasts .  
2	  This is a GREAT product I would like to call . I especially like the auto feed function and PaperPort software for scanning . You can scan up to 35 pages each time and save these pages as a single document using the PaperPort software . You can also scan double sides for many pages each time . The software will automatically arrange the pages for you in a right way . You can also straiten each page after each scanning . The copier and printer are easy operated and work very well for me . Every function is extremely user friendly , including the USB cable . I think this is one of the best investment I have made so far if this machine can last longer than 3 years . Extremely fast shipping , only took me one day for waiting . My purpose of writing this review is let others know this great product and appreciate the efforts this company have put on this product . I also want to correct one misunderstanding by others : this machine CAN scan multiple pages and save it as a single document using PaperPort Software .  
1	  Well , I went and got one and the next day I suffered an electrical shock through my ear drums . To make matters worse the item stopped playing . How about calling customer service ? Well , that was 2 months ago and still waiting for a call back . If you like waisting money on new toys like I did than buy it , if not keep using your CD player its all hype . Also , 32mb of music only amounts to 6 ( 4min ) songs .  
1	  The card stores the data , but my Toshiba notebook with Windows 2000 can't read the card with the builtin card reader : it recognizes a new drive , but can't access data inside it . Searching the net , i found other users with the same problem with Sandisk 2GB cards .  
2	  I commute between states and this works very well , even in NY . Produces far less noise then others . The trick is to find the cleanest frequencies in the area for best results - the ability to store multiple frequencies is wonderful when traveling over some distance .  
2	  product came fast , on time . exactly what i wanted . the product works . couldnt / wouldnt ask for more  
1	  After getting what we thought was a good Christmas deal on this printer , we have been totally disappointed to discover that , contrary to stated compatibility on the box and other documentation , it is not compatible with Mac OS X Leopard . After a call to support we discover that they are still writing software for Leopard here at the end of January and it will not be available for the foreseeable future . It is hard to believe that a company as reputable as HP would do such a horrendous job with software and misrepresent their products ' compatibility in all their documentation .  
2	  Easy to use . Does exactly what it says it 'll do and I use it all the time for salads and making home-made potato chips .  
1	  I had problems right out of the box for burning CDs / DVDs . I have sent the unit to HP and spent hours on the phone and it still does not work . HP support in India and in the US have not provided adequate support in the process . I would pick a different brand .  
1	  I had this radio about six months and the SD card reader went out . Poor reception for the radio leaves me with buyers remorse . Go with a better brand . Stay away from Boss . I swapped it for a better radio .  
1	  I really wanted to like this lens ; nice build quality and had a really good feel . I also liked the larger 62 mm Filter Thread compared to comparable lenses . However , mounting the lens already felt somewhat odd . It did not want to go on a 7D body as easily and smooth as my Canon or Tamron lenses . Taking the 1st shots and looking at them at the camera 's LCD already was a little disappointing - the pictures has an odd pale almost green look . After importing the photos into Lightroom we saw the stunningly poor quality . Not even close to an inexpensive 1.8 nifty fifty and even worse than my zoom lenses in that rage ; unbelievably soft and out of focus . Next we did the common focus test ( described in much detail here : [ .. ] ) and the results showed that the focus was off by 15mm with a 500mm focus distance . But even the areas that looked like were in focus , were totally soft all the way to f5.6 . Don't know how Sigma can stay in business when delivering products like this 30mm . Take a look at one of the photos we took during the focus test - and to be fair to Sigma , this was the VERY best we could find . [ .. ] This was my 1st Sigma experience and I 'm really glad the Amazon has such a great return policy . This thing didn't stay even 12 hours at my house . Sorry Sigma - never again will I buy one of your products .  
2	  Once you get this gizmo going , it works nicely . You can connect multiple computers on your home network to a printer that 's within WiFi range . But setting it up is a challenge , because you have to do exactly the right things in exactly the right sequence , and some of the things you have to do right aren't mentioned in the setup wizard that runs when you insert the Linksys setup CD into your computer , or they 're mentioned so late in the process that you may have to start all over again ! The process takes about 90 minutes if you do everything right the first time around and don't have to double back . Most of the time you 're watching software load - it 's as exciting as watching paint dry . Here 's what you have to do , as far as I 'm able to recount from having just done it for a friend 's home network . If you think the following is written in Greek or maybe in Geek , get someone else to do this for you . If you 're up to the challenge , this review may save you time and frustration and prevent more 1-star reviews . ( 1 ) Before you set the print server up , it 's a good idea to go to the web site of the company that makes your router ( Linksys , D-Link , Netgear , etc . ) and download and install the latest " firmware " for your router . That takes maybe 15 minutes . ( 2 ) Move the printer close to the PC that 's connected to your wireless router . It has to be close enough to the router for you to connect it via a standard Ethernet ( " patch " or " Internet " ) cable . It 's not a big deal , but it means you may have to set the printer up in one place and then move it back to where you want it to be . ( Linksys supplies the necessary cables in the box , which is to their credit . Most printer manufacturers make you buy your own cable . ) ( 3 ) The printer needs to be set up on the computer using a wired ( USB ) connection * before * you try to set up the wireless connection . If you 're just going wireless with a printer you 've already installed on the PC that 's connected to your WiFi router , you 're all set . But if you 're installing a new printer , or trying to go wireless with a printer you 've moved from some other computer , be sure to install it as a USB printer first . ( 3-a ) Once you have the printer set up as a wireless " network " computer , you may want to uninstall the USB version of the same printer , because when you boot up , some versions of Windows will give you endless warnings that the local printer isn't connected . ( 3-b ) This also means that if you ever buy a new printer and you want to connect it wirelessly via the Linksys print server , you have to install it first as a ( wired ) USB printer , and then re-run the " Set Up Computer " wizard from the CD that comes with the Linksys . Don't lose that CD ! ( 4 ) The setup wizard asks for a password for the print server . You can use any password you like , BUT then it asks for a passphrase , and the wizard fails to point out that you need the exact WEP passphrase or WEP key you 've ( already ) used to set up your wireless router . ( You are using WEP or stronger security on your wireless router , right ? If not , go find out how to set up WEP security and do it immediately . ) ( 4-a ) The setup wizard asks for a passphrase , but if you 've used a passcode on your router , there 's a way to enter it you look carefully at the screen . ( 5 ) Once you complete setting up the wireless print server , the wizard leads you through setting up your computer . Again , you must have already installed the printer onto the computer via a USB cable before you get to this point ! Follow the instructions and by gosh - it works ! Then at the very end there 's a small note saying that if you want to set up other computers , you have to install the printer drivers first . Nice of Linksys to point that out at the very end ; it would have saved me an hour of messing around if they 'd said that at the beginning ! ( 6 ) Once the printer is set up , it 's the default printer , and it wasn't possible ( at least for me , with Windows XP ) to set a different printer up as the default printer on one of the computers on my home friend 's network . A minor irritation , in most cases , and there may be a workaround . If I find it I 'll add it to this review . So : 5 stars for convenience once it 's set up ; 3 stars for the glitch with the default ; 2 stars for poor setup instructions .. how do you rate this thing ? 4 stars , I guess .  
2	  Inexpensive , no notable flaws , does the same thing a Monster cable would do for 10th of the price . At this length , you don't need to worry about signal degradation or anything like that .  
2	  Even though you do not get this in an actually monster package this seems to be legit . Does as it says and I actually compared this to the same one that I did get in the actual monster package and I can't tell the difference . Why pay more for a plastic package that your gonna just throw out anyway . For anyone looking for a high quality monster hdmi and not wanting to spend a fortune this is probably your best option .  
2	  As a novice , I splurged on this camera and have no regrets . It is easy to use and I have gotten some beautiful shots . The portraits I have taken of my children are amazing . They look like they were taken by a professional , which I am definitely not . This camera is worth the price .  
1	  These do have good noise blocking abilities , assuming you can get one of the several different types of covers to fit your ear canal comfortably ( probably ) . The problem is the sound quality - it 's like the entire lower half of the spectrum is GONE . Not reduced , I 'm not talking ' weak bass ' , I 'm talking NO BASS . To the extent that it 's even noticeable and bothersome on spoken word stuff - that much of the spectrum is missing . Very disappointed in these ..  
2	  Customer service was good . It is a slick unit . I liked the velvet bag for carrying it with you .  
1	  I got this player 2 months ago . It worked fine , it takes some time to get used to using it , but once I did , it was great . HOWEVER , I was using it while walking to class , and the screen just shattered . I did nothing out of the ordinary , it just shattered . The glass is all gone and the screen itself is half-black from it . I e-mailed them AND called them , and I was told from both places that the screen is not covered under warranty ( seems as if almost nothing truly is ) . I even asked them if I could pay to have it repaired , and they said no , tough luck . Anyway , I 'm pretty pissed off right now . I wasted 200 bucks on a decent player , but the warranty makes it not worth [ .. ] . As much as I truly hate to say it , I may buy an ipod next .. atleast they know how to keep a happy customer . I will never buy another iRiver product EVER again .  
2	  After purchasing this camera a year ago I donated my SLR camera to my high school alma matter . The Sony Cybershot is a easy to use camera that allows you to take any kind of picture you want . Even though I rate the camera itself 5 stars , I wish Sony would create lens and other camera accessories for this professional style camera .  
1	  in my opinion , this product simply does not work . i am reluctant to give it one star , but i guess that 's my only option . to begin with , i am constantly being kicked off line only to pick up my phone and hear a dial tone . the manual says this problem is due to surges in the phone line . it happens often and is REALLY annoying . but on the other hand , if someone tries to call while i am online , about half the time they simply here a busy signal . and yes , i do have call waiting . finally , i have had this product for about 2 months now and this week it just died on me . no indicator lights are lit and i am unable to fax through it or receive calls while online . save your money , or better yet get DSL .  
2	  received these as a gift after i lost an old pair of cheapy binoculars that i used for birding . was a little wary at first since there were only 2 reviews , but i have to agree with the other reviewers that these are great for people that wear glasses . the plastic twist-up eye cups are much more sturdy and easier to use than the rubber roll-down ones i 've seen on other binoculars . image is crisp and clear , even over glasses . it also seems that the price is also very reasonable , as many birding resources recommend binoculars that cost over $ 100 , if not $ 300 .  
1	  sound quality is good and it fits in my ears nicely , but here 's the thing , it broke only a few weeks after i bought them .  
1	  I made the mistake of purchasing this product just over a year ago . It sits safely on my desk , out of harms way . Last night , the router mysteriously stopped working . Thinking it was me , I followed the " help " directions and got nowhere . My next step was Linksys customer service . The first representative suggested that I purchase another router , and made suggestions . Purchase another router ? ! After 9 representatives , supervisors , and managers , I was told that the product is only guaranteed to last about 10 mths . which essentially means buying a wireless router once per year . There is no standing behind their product , it 's 10 mths . and done . NO THANK YOU .  
1	  I bought this to use in a GoPro Helmet Hero HD video camera . At 720p and 60fps settings , the card won't keep up with the camera even though some Class 4 cards I 've used will . I 'm going to have to relegate this card to still camera use . I had good luck with the Sandisk 16gb video card which is only rated at Class 4 . SanDisk SDSDHV-016G-A15 16GB Video HD SDHC Card ( Black )  
1	  Buyer Beware ! This portable DVD player was purchased as a present with the purpose of using it while flying on long trips , unfortunately you cannot hear it even with good headphones over the plane noise . I took it to Best Buy today to see if there is something wrong with the unit . The salesman in the tv / dvd department was not surprised by my complaint . He said the Samsungs have a low audio output compared to other models . He suggested I ask the Geek Squad in the front of the store to get their opinion . The person I spoke with was very helpful and said this appears to be a problem with the Samsung portable DVD players from information he had found on the internet . I ended up buying a booster for $ 34.00 . When I got home , I called Samsung and that was a waste of time . Samsung tried to tell me all the manufacturers are having this problem with the portable DVD players and basically they do not care and will do nothing to insure customer satisfaction . I asked him if Samsung would reimburse me the $ 34.00 I spent on a booster since their system 's sound is inadequate . I was told not to waste my time . So much for customer service . I will never purchase a Samsung product ever again and advise other consumers to do the same .  
2	  There 's not a whole lot to say about the item , had to get some in for a couple customers of mine , and it 's exactly what they were looking for . Good product , would buy from again .  
1	  This is by far the worst MFP I have ever owned . As mentioned by many others it 's loud . The printing is average at best . Worst of all the ink is expensive . You can't refill the cartridges with ink because it will not recognize the cartridge as being full . So basically , you are buying a disposable printer . When the ink runs out buy a new printer-it 's cheaper .  
2	  TV : Sony Grand WEGA 50 inchReceiver : Harmon Kardon AVR330Sub : JBL 12inch NorthridgeFloor : JBL E80 NorthridgeCenter : Infinity Primus C254 Surround Sats : Klipsch SatellitesDVD Player : Sony DVP-NS50PGoing from standard unfilitered power to this unit was the best thing i have ever done for my home theater . The difference is HUGE ! and I highly reccommend this unit to anybody looking to add a totally new level of clarity and vibrance to your home theater setup . I can now turn the reciever up to full power and put my ear up to the speakers and hear ZERO buzz or noise . Previous to purchasing this power unit I could always notice a slight hiss in the system . This hiss was completely eliminated by the HTS3500 . The colors of my TV are also noticably brighter and sharper . BUY THIS !  
1	  I found these headphones to be very uncomfortable , not to mention the clips catch in your hair , if you have long hair . They also do not sound anywhere near as good as the Panasonic RP-HG10 .. which I highly recommend .  
2	  This body replaced my original EOS 300D Digital Rebel body . It is a bit smaller and lighter than my previous , but is still constructed well . Aside from the upgraded CMOS sensor and added features , the big difference for me is the LCD display . On my digital rebel the settings display only filled the top portion of the small LCD . On the XTi the information actually fills the whole screen which a 2.5 " display . For my 40 + year old eyes that have reduced near vision that is great ! I now can shoot and adjust without having to pull my glasses up to see the shutter speed , ISO , aperture , etc . The bottom line .. its solid Canon quality at a reasonable price !  
2	  I purchased this product based on a recommendation in Consumer Reports magazine . It was in fact simple to install on my small home network and easy to configure and use . It has rudimentary security - better than none , but not very reassuring at times . Still , I am not sure if I could handle a product that had a complicated security scheme . This works for me : it is easy to install , fast , enabled me to put many files shared by our home computers in one location thus freeing space on our personal notebook / laptop computers . I would buy another .  
2	  I wanted something with a decent optical zoom that fit into the ' micro ' category to take on a vacation . It fit the bill perfectly until it stopped working halfway through the trip . No explanation on what happend . I took it back for servicing at the store where I purchased it and have not had a response back . Therefore , I cannot comment on what the fault may have been . I can , however say that while the camera was functional , it performed very well . The camera does not have a view finder , but that does not stop you from getting accurately framed photos . The lcd screen is large for the overall size of the camera . The special picture modes that were used gave good results when used for the appropriate situations , e.g. scenery , night time portrait , party , night time scenery . The photos themselves turned out to be of very good color balance and detail . No complaints there . In fact , the only reason that I deducted a star is because of the unexplained breakdown . If there is a problem with the replacement , I will come back and deduct more . In summation , excellent camera for size , zoom capability for size , and piture quality .  
2	  Simply amazing is all i can say about these headphones . I think they are the best headphones for 100 or less . I have tried senns , sonys , skullcandys and numerous other brands and none sound as good as the porta pro 's . the headphones really sound great , excellent actually . it is hard to beat these headphones , throw in the lifetime no questions ask warranty and it really is a no brainer . the only flaw i see is that it can at times pull your hair when taking them on / off .  
2	  I didn't have a lot of cash to spend on speakers , so you better bet that I did my research before purchasing these . And man , did I make a good decision . The bass is AMAZING , and I don't even have an amp wired in , just running off my JVC head unit . I have not yet installed the tweeters , so I 'm excited that there is still more to come . For under $ 50 , you just can't beat it .  
2	  I 've used many other thermal grease before but this one is one of the best . grease goes on easily and seem to be thicker than other paste .  
2	  If you transfer a lot of files between computers than a flash-memory drive is absolutely essential . Students and teacher in particular ( or anyone else who needs to transfer a lot of files or make frequent backups ) will find these drives absolutely indespensible . Why go through the hassle of burning cds all the time ? Why go through the trouble of linking two machines just to transfer a few files ? It is quite likely that drives like this one will replace floppies in the very near future . Fast , easy to use , reliable , durable , and infinitely re-writable . What more could anyone ask for ? And especially since the price keeps dropping lower and lower ..  
2	  I was given this DVD player as a gift from a friend ( actually , I was given the black-coloured version , but they share same features and options , only this one comes with a silver case ) , and with that I entered the digital age of video . It is a great improvement over the VHS player I had , and I had a hi-fi VHS player with four heads and all the bells and whistles intended to give a clear and stable picture . Quite frankly , there is no comparison . The picture when playing DVDs is crystal clear , through playback , fast-forward , reverse , and still . Of course there is occasionally fuzziness due to the motion of the action on screen , but in comparison to the stills and fast speeds of the VCR , again this player wins easily . There are some interesting features , like DVD lock-outs ( I haven't had the need , but perhaps a family with young children could use it to prevent adult-rated DVDs from being viewed ) , and disc-resume for several discs ( the documentation tells me up to 6 discs , but I 've only ever used it one at a time ) . I had wondered how one saves a spot on a film the way one does on VHS tapes ; now I know ! This has features for various DVD formats , and includes audio CDs and MP3s . I have this connected to the equaliser of my stereo , and the sound is fantastic for both CDs and DVDs . There is a virtual surround sound that enhances the sound through the stereo ; while I don't have a four - or six-speaker set-up , I still have a much greater experience of sound from this DVD player than from the VCR that is likewise connected to my stereo . Of course , with a brand name of Sony , one expects high quality , and on this DVD player , they deliver . I have learned to trust Sony products over the past 30 years ( I had a television which lasted nearly 25 years from Sony ) . This machine is very slim , and fits quite well on top of my VCR , so there was no need to rearrange furniture , buy new stands , etc . It is compact and easy to install , and has auto-set-up features that make it almost completely plug-and-play . By far my greatest surprise with a DVD player , however , has to be that it makes a great cat toy . Cat toy , you ask ? Yes . With the remote , the disc drawer can be opened and closed by remote control . One cat finds this truly fascinating , and tries to ' catch ' the tray as it zooms in and out . The cat also is attracted to the lights on the face going on and off . Who knew ?  
2	  My only issue with the device are the controls . Could be a little more user friendly . Other than that , it plays great , the sound is perfect and it is extremely durable . Dropped the device , while music was playing , from a distance of about 5 feet straight to the concrete . Picked it up , put the ear buds back in my ears and it hadn't even missed a beat . Music was still playing . No worse for the wear . I recommend this mp3 player .  
2	  Ordered it because it came at a very reasonable price with Panasonic KX-TG7645M , and am glad I did it becuase it works great and make it so convenient to use with the cordless phones .. a great basic headset .  
1	  Still a great camerra if but you like bad cameras . I docked the dock by the dock . Hickory dickory dock . The camera is good , but I wish I could still write . I think that the batteries should give it power , but I only had it for two days . Sometimes it fits in my pants . this is a good camera unless you like good cameras then you should consider buying a different one one that is better or people will hate you everywhere  
1	  There seems to be a glitch in Amazon . com 's system . I 've ordered these directly and through several " new and used " distributors listed here .. and I always get standard tapes instead of silver . AVOID !  
1	  Okay , since I have only owned this for a week and it is already " breaking " , it should get a 1 Star rating . However , there are some positives to it and maybe you will get one that holds up . I wanted an iPod charging unit and had no need for the FM transmitter so I went with this unit . I have an AUX ( auxillary ) jack on my car stereo and you can't get any better sound quality from an iPod than playing through it . Plus , It was much cheaper than purchasing a unit with an FM transmitter . PROS : 1 ) The Design . Flexible neck . Good height , about 8 inches , and it allows the unit to be easily moved around to not interfere with radio or Air conditioning controls . When I first plugged it in I thought " This is great . A good sturdy unit " I was wrong though .. see the CONS . 2 ) the AUX jack . You can plug the mini-stereo cord into the front of the cigarette lighter charger plug and then into your AUX ( auxillary ) jack of your stereo . That way you only have to drop the iPod in and take it out . No cords to plug in and out . CONS : 1 ) The plug for the cigarette lighter has a big rubber gasket on it to " prevent slipping " . The problem ? It only worked for about a week before the rubber would no longer stay stiff enough to keep the unit from swinging to the right or left and having the iPod hang upside down ! I was very disappointed this product only lasted a Week and have now printed a return label to send it back . I was worried that this might eventually become a problem . I just had no idea it would only take a week for the rubber gasket / cigarette port to start sliding . Just as a note , it does stay IN the socket , put it doesn't stay stationary ( it swings / slides ) so it is not a stable unit for my iPod . 2 ) The hi / low switch and AUX jack . I found my sound quality was louder and clearer if I plug the stereo cable in between the headphone jack of the iPod and the AUX jack on the stereo . If I plugged it in to the charger unit , on Low power , it sounded very muffled . On high power , it sounded " okay " but not as good or loud as using the headphone jack . So , I am not getting back online to find an alternative unit . I 'll probably have to purchase a ' fixed ' position unit that also has an FM transmitter because that seems to be the majority of what is out there . We 'll see . Bottom line , I cannot suggest this unit to anyone because it doesn't function as described . I just bought one of these for my wifes car too ( a Nano version ) . We 'll see if it lasts .  
1	  Within 6 months of installation , over half of the lights illuminating the buttons went out leaving me to search for the buttons at night time . Why go for the buttons when I have a remote , you ask ? This is because apparently the remote cannot hold up to frequent use . The most frequently used buttons ( which are like little bubbles ) cracked and the covering came off . It 's almost impossible to use the buttons without the covering over the remote board because it doesn't recognize when just your fingers are pushing on the bare board . Also , after going on the official Pyle website , the " Contact Us " link is apparently the only link that didn't , and still doesn't ( 4 months later ) work so I emailed them through one of their other links ( regarding some other question , but inquired about my issues ) yet still have not received a response .  
1	  The Roku Soundbridge is a VERY buggy product . I live in a condominium in which many neighbors use wireless internet . The Soundbridge will frequently ( and without warning ) switch to a neighbor 's network . Correcting this problem involves re-keying in my wireless key , one character at a time with a scrolling selector , and restarting the unit . For this reason , I now use the ethernet connection . The problem here is that if the unit detects a wireless signal ANYWHERE , it connects to it and disables the ethernet connection . The only way I have found to avoid this behavior is to reboot the unit while placing it in a large metal toolbox , which sometimes blocks the RF signal from my neighbors . Even this strategy requires many ( 25 or more ) restarts of the unit . Even when it is functioning correctly , the unit will switch to a neighbor 's wireless network every couple weeks , leaving me to go through the above-detailed process . Technical assistance is non-existent , and Roku refused to exchange my unit under warranty for the above-described software defect . You would be well-advised to avoid this product .  
2	  After going through 5 digital cameras in about a month ( this was my 6th ) , I am really thrilled ! A fantastic camera , with awesome features . This is one camera which can satisfy both the novice as well as the advanced photographer . You can make the camera automatically adjust all the settings if you want to , or you can manually adjust all the settings . The LCD screen is 1.8 " big , and is cool . The best part is the batteries . It requires 4 AA batteries . With the 4 supplied by Canon , I took about 160 pictures , using the LCD a lot of the time . This was in addition to using it for playback , etc . This time , I am using the NiMH rechargables , and I have already taken about 200 pictures , again , using the LCD most of the time . Great job , Canon !  
2	  does this player come with a car adapter or is there a place to get one ?  
2	  I have two pairs of these now , bought an extra pair for traveling with my wife . I have had the first pair over three years , use them daily . I think the sound is great , much crisper than most others for this price , they fit my ears well . No complaints .  
1	  This dvd player is junk . Plain and simple . It is cute and when it worked it was great . The problem is it only worked for about 4 months . We started having problems with it within the first two months and by the fourth month it quit completely . I wrote the disney company about this and they offered to fix it or to give my money back , but my husband and I decided it wasn't worth it and we will never buy another disney electronic again .  
2	  We picked this up so we could hook our computer up to the HDTV . For the most part it works fine ! Every now and then it decides not to type . It worked fine for this review !  
1	  I returned this product shortly after purchasing at Walmart . It dvd tray was made of cheap plastic and hung out very loosely . I do not think the product is meant to last more a year at best if used often and gingerly . It plays divx files on cds very well , but had problems with divx files on dvds . It is  
1	  This is the worst DVD player I 've ever owned . 1 . The controls are terrible : they are unresponsive from the remote AND the front panel . 2 . When the machine is turned off , say in the middle of a movie to go to sleep and watch the rest tomorrow , it doesn't remember where it left off from . Toshiba has no fix for this problem . 3 . If you stop the movie for an extended break , the unit turns off automatically . Refer to # 2 for additional info . 4 . My machine ( about 8-12 months old ) was received non-functioning . Toshiba sent me a refurb 'd replacement , which is now dying too . I 've seen other dvd players out there with HDMI upconverting ( 1080i ) .. try one of those instead .  
2	  The Canon ink is great and the price is fantastic . However , the shipping costs for the products that weigh almost nothing is way too high . Do not think you will save by buying online here . I could have bought locally ( and paid tax ) for cheaper - I guess I 've learned my lesson . It also took some weeks to arrive . For the cost , I would have expected overnight delivery .  
2	  I got this in the mail last week . I have loaded 565 songs on it using Microsoft Media Player V10 . I have 1688 MB free out of the 3700 available . I also ordered Shure E2C ear buds with it and don't use the provided units at all . I have boosted the BASS in the equalizer settings and have found everything to my liking . While I am educated about electronics / HDTV / Stereo , Home theater etc . this was my first foray into the MP3 world . I took the unit out of the box , saw that it played with the provided charge , opened my Media Player to see about Ripping a CD and the unit sync 'd with the computer and I had my CD 's on the player in less than 30 minutes . It doesn't get any easier than that . I believe REALLY good software / hardware doesn't need a manual - this unit rates a ' 5 ' of ' 5 ' with me . I put it in my jeans pocket , popped the Shure e2c ear buds in and spent two days rebuilding my fence - no problems with anything - I couldn't be happier . I thought the PRICE was excellent for the memory provided . Part of me says I should have gotten the 8MB unit , but the other part of me says " with 1000 songs ( potentially ) , you 'll be fine " . I do not use it for video or photo 's . I read the CD-manual and figured out to use WIndows Explorer and went in and deleted the factory loaded songs , pictures and all video files . I HAVE preset 6 FM-stations that come in very well considering I live in pretty much a jerk water town of limited FM resources . I am looking forward to receiving the FM-transmitter from iRiver so I can listen to this in my truck - my car has the XM-radio :( I found the controls to be sensible and easy to use . I wear a Men 's size 12 glove and my ring size is 12 as well - I have large hands and find the controls easy to use and I simply do not understand the comparisons with the iPod - other than the cost differential . All in all - I 'd do it again in a heartbeat knowing what I know now .  
1	  I installed it to my xp , the GPS receiver cannot detect anything , the user interface is confusing , I tried everything , but the GPS receiver still doesn't work , finally I return it . Then I bought a Microsoft Street , it works perfect , quick and easy set up , except that it doesn't have voice functionality .  
2	  This webcam works great . It was easy to install and very easy to operate . I have never been dissapointed by any of Microsoft 's hardware devices .  
1	  Anko claims that this mouse is Mac-compatible , which is only partly true . The included CD does not include a driver for Mac , and when I emailed the company , they directed me to shareware drivers , for which there is a fee , and when I tried one ( USB Overdrive ) , the mouse only worked as a normal one-click mouse , and the scroll button didn't work . The much-vaunted vibration effect was completely absent . The other alternative offered by the company was to return the mouse . In addition , I bought the mouse as part of a full-rebate offer in September . It is now late January , and I still have not received my check . A look at their web-page reveals that no one has received a check for this rebate yet . To sum up , buy Anko and AVB products at your own risk !  
1	  I use this camera for work taking picture of damaged vehicles . For outside use in good light it works fine . However if you are in a parking garage taking a picture ( poor lighting ) you are out of luck unless you are ultra-close to your intended target . The flash is weak , I have not been able to take a good picture inside without good lighting . Also I can't stand the horrible delay in start up and shutter lag , this thing takes for ever to take a picture . I do have the docking station which is great for transfering pictures to your computer ; however , it is unreliable for charging . You have to go through a ritual of turning the camera on and off ( or opening the battery door ) to get the docking station to make the proper connection and actually charge ? My prior DC50 ( early model digital ) worked much better .  
2	  I have a 5 year old boy who loves to play computer games . Sadly , his computer is in the same room as mine and those beepings and boopings make me want to climb up the wall ; especially if I 'm trying to pay bills or write lesson plans . These headphones saved us ! They fit him perfectly and he is able to adjust the volume to his liking while all I hear is blessed silence . I highly recommend these !  
1	  This remote did not work with all of our components . It limited the capabilities of our cable television DVR and only worked with our surround sound system a few times . It was difficult to program . I gave it to a friend with only a TV and DVD player and bought myself another brand that works great .  
2	  These cables are fantastic . They work just as well as cables costing many times as much ( the signal they carry is digital so the quality of the cable itself is meaningless - there is NO signal degradation possible as there is with analog signals ) .  
2	  I am extremely happy with this product , it is a wonderful piece of equipment . I use it most days as it takes me the shortest route . It is truly amazing . It 's very practical because it is small and easy to handle and also mounts very easily on my dash . Very easy to set up and directions are great . I would highly recommend it .  
2	  I am so pleased with my Toshiba e310 . The balance of features and pricing is outstanding ! The processor is the same one that you would find on models costing $ .. and the screen is very clear and bright . The amount of applications is just right and includes the core necessities such as Word , Excel , Outlook , etc . It does not include lots of extra programs like some of the other models out there , but quite frankly I don't need them anyway . Plus , it is so THIN ( as thin as a Palm V ) and its a VERY sharp looking PDA with a solid feel ! Not to mention , it saved me lots of $ . I tried both the Compaq and HP - the Toshiba is undoubtedly a top choice in Pocket PCs .  
2	  About 8 years ago I bought a similar pair of astronomical binoculars from Celestron - the 15x70 model . I must say after comparing the old 15x70 with the new 20x80 I 'm not too impressed . On the plus side ( and this is a significant plus ) the mounting / support bar on the 20x80 model is much better than the mounting solution for the 15x70 . It 's far more stable and resistant to wobble , which is really important for good viewing . On the down side , the optics of the new 20x80 seem to be of lesser quality . There 's seems to be more flaring and greater difficultly getting a very clean and sharp image . If I had to choose one pair based solely on image quality , I 'd stick with my old 70 's . When looking for deep sky objects , I think you can see some marginal benefit as the 80 's gather more light but it 's minor . Still , when you consider how inexpensive these are , I find it hard to complain . One can hardly expect stellar optics when you consider the cost . This is a product that offers a lot of bang for the buck so be realistic about your expectations . On that score , these are winners .  
2	  This camera is great value for the money . The 6x zoom is great , the image stablization works very well . It doesn't have some manual settings ( exposure etc . ) , max exposure you can set is 8 seconds in night scenery mode , so some dark night pics can get pretty grainy . But anything with decent to great light is terrific . The lcd itself shows grainy images occasionaly , i think that 's because of lower resolution , but the images turned out great . just bought it for $ 230 and jandr . Pretty fast camera too , don't have a high-speed hd card . very easy to use interface , and all preset modes give info on how to use them . Plastic body doesn't seem like a problem , but i 'd recommend getting some kind of a case since the lcd is completely unprotected . very light with the 2 aa batteries too .  
2	  First of all , this is almost 1/2 the cost at Walmart . My biggest complaint about this DVD player is that it takes forever to boot up . When you want to put a DVD in , you have to wait for it to boot up before you can even eject the old DVD . Otherwise , it 's fairly decent .  
1	  Some quick points : I bought two of these and there is a marked difference in image quality between the two . One gives a very good quality image and the other one gives a very poor image . I picked these over linksys products based upon reviews giving them a more favorable image quality . Here I would just add caution that there is enough in product variability that such claims can not be reliably made . for someone with experience setting up wireless cameras this may or may not be an easy setup . I don't fall into that category , and setup was laborious for me , and the written instruction provided by trendnet is poor . If you want to put positive spin on this , despite the inadequate instruction included by the manufacturer I was able to set up the cameras successfully after an hour or two with the aid of the internet . my take is that the setup is more problematic than it should be . below average . my chief complaint about the camera is that it does not run like it should , and the included software is horrid . you have two means by which you can program the camera . the first is by connecting directly to its IP address and changing settings directly , and the second is by using the IPview software that is included . Honestly I do not know which one of these works , because in practice the camera only sporadically recognizes the changes . For instance you supposedly can control one of the two led lights on the front of the camera .. off , on ( blinks when camera is active ) , or dummy ( blinks randomly ) . Thats an easy test , and the cameras largely fail to recognize the instruction . The most concerning problem i have with the camera is that the motion detection almost never works , and I 'm beginning to wonder if the IPview software must be turned on to use this feature . A camera pointed at a door always fails to capture me entering or leaving .. defeating the whole purpose . If i stand infront of the camera waving i do manage to get an image . my experience has been below average , not to say that my results are representative . I am hopeful that with third party software these cameras can be converted into average preformers .  
2	  While this product cannot beat the sound quality of an auxiliary plug-in , it is in a close second leaving FM Transmitters in a distant third . Installed in 45 minutes . I highly recommend this product .  
1	  In the race to be the first to have the thinnest vibrant color handheld palm has failed miserably ! Palm should recall this product . If you can live without color try the m500 instead .  
2	  I purchased this for my husband as a Christmas gift .. and now we fight over who 's car it will be kept in ! We just love it .. and recently took it on a trip with us to Florida . Being in unknown territory , it worked like a charm ! Getting us to and from the airport with ease , plus all the little side trips and restaurants during our stay were a breeze . The only thing we didn't get was the leather case for carrying , which I found out from a friend , was available for this unit . I would recommend getting that if available .  
2	  Just got the Orb USB for my laptop and its great . Immediate 2.2 gigs of space and its removable . For anyone who needs extra drive space for backing up or whatever , this is a great deal . I play my movies off the thing and its just like a hard drive . No skipping or anything . I plan to use it to store all of my MP3 's and video media that I have . So far I havn't had any problems with it . I 'm quite happy with my new Orb . Its a far better deal than Zip drives . Much more storage at a cheaper price . Its a deal and a half .  
1	  i bought these speakers thinking they would be good .. no they were soo crapy i through them away . the speakers make a loud sound that ulmost makes you think they are blown .. but they just came out of the box .. dont waste your money  
1	  I 'm a network engineer and this thing is absolutely HORRIBLE ! DHCP doesn't work well . I keep getting duplicate IPs on the network even when everything is set to use DHCP . It just doesn't handle DHCP requests well at all . When I first got it , wireless G kept dropping out . I struggled w / that for weeks . Now , I have to reset it almost 3 times a day because it just " stops working " .. literally ! Doesn't pass any traffic through it . I use VOIP and when talking on the phone , it just drops .. quite EMBARRASING ! Support ? Support seems like a bunch of unqualified people who only know the basics and they repeat them over and over .. USELESS.I 've been a HUGE Linksys user / supporter for a while , this product ALONE has made me look elsewhere from now on . We have their Business wireless devices ( another FLOP ! ) , GB business switches ( this isn't so bad ) , and home products from cable modems , wireless routers , etc etc . So , I 've known and liked them .. UNTIL THIS THING !  
2	  I ordered this with the camera and was surprised as just how handy it is . The small carabiner on the back makes it easy to attach to a belt loop and the velcro / zipper close also makes it easy to grab those shots you normally miss . It 's especially handy when hiking with a pack or kid on your back .  
1	  I got this Radio / MP3 Media Player in January 2009 . After I received it , I filled the 2 GB of space with music . Not long thereafter I noticed that the media player would reset or lock every time it started playing some songs ( I suspect WMA files ) . After that , I stopped using the MP3 Player feature alltogether and only used it 's radio and voice recording features . You can also download pictures into it , albeit using a special software which converts the files to a smaller size which can be viewed on the player 's screen . Getting the software to work was very tricky , because you have to know which option to select after you plug the player to your PC . The battery stopped working ( after being fully charged it discharged completely after 2 minutes ) in 2 and a half years . All in all , I 'm not too dissatisfied with this product due to its very low price . I would still be satisfied if the battery wouldn't have died on me .  
2	  I purchased this lens in order to have one lens with a fairly wide range for traveling . It worked very well for this task . If you are very picky about your photos , you will notice some chromatic aboration around 17mm , but that is to be expected for a lens of this range . The image stabilization works surprisingly well and allowed me to shoot crisp pictures at shutter speeds nearly as low as 1 second hand held . The large range combined with the somewhat wide angle at 17 mm made this an excellent choice for me while traveling . I would recommend this lens .  
2	  Last night I hooked these into my surround for the back speakers . My wife didn't like the clutter of the larger speakers we have been using so I bought these guys for their small size . Smallish house . 20 x 20 listening area . Well anyway I ran the auto set up for the surround and pumped some movie scenes through them to see if they worked and no big deal . This morning I put them on top of the main big front speakersSony SS-F6000 Floor-Standing 4-Way Speakers with 6.5 " Woofer ( pair , black ) and hooked the big speaker 's wires to them and just ran the Sony SS-B1000 speakers I am reviewing here . You know just to hear what I could hear . See if I got jipped . I put on some Jazz music . I am impressed . First I looked to see if the my $ 500 sub was running . I had it set on stereo so the sub should be sleeping . It was . HmmThen I started to think some how the big speakers they were sitting on were working . I KNEW they were not , because I had removed the wires leading to them , but I had to look anyway . They are setting out from the wall about four feet which can make a difference in sound ( you may not get the full effect if you stuff them on a book shelf ; I am not sure though worth a try ) . Apparently those little ports in the front of these little speakers really are there for more than looks . Yes these are small speakers , I am not saying they will replace a $ 500 sub or the Sony SS-F6000s but they sound GOOD . For $ 50 , these days , it is rare to be this pleased with a purchase . I am pleased with my purchase !  
1	  Good product , great engineering , neat disgin , replacable cord , but not flat sounding , its like having the Bass and Treble at + 3dB all the time . Some may like this effect . It muffles the voices , violins , and horns , but with rap , hip hop and metal , they are fine . I own the Super . Fi 5 Pro and have decided to not keep them , after comparing some parts of Pink Floyd , namely The Wall where the airplane engine transitions to the baby crying , that baby has to be there in your lap , and the UE 's tend to mute the baby , so you have to wonder where the baby is . It doesnt sound as real . I also like to refernce blues and wind instruments and used some Miles to see if I likes the mids , and though the highs are crisp , the mids are a little muted , but not in a bad way . I just felt that honesty is an important quality , the ear phones I own by Sennheiser ( CX-300 , these are my wife 's old set ) , my Sony 71SL ( keep these for backup in a drawer at home ) and the Shure e4c ( wife 's new set I owned briefly ) . My next try will be the Shure e5c product , I felt the highs were too bright on the UE product and the bass too enhanced by their porting design , though effective , it has harmonic qualities that render the powerful low end rather muffled in loud passages . Yo-Yo Ma 's Cello sounded less than distinct off the Digitally remastered recordings I used . The UE Super . Fi 5 Pro would make great headphones for the DJs , Stage performers and other folks who need loud sound over the tonal flatness an audiophile may seek from a more ' reference ' sounding acoustic driver . I missed the horns and flutes that my old Shure e4c were able to reach while i really have to drive the UE hard to try and get those notes , by which point I feel I may be over driving the speaker . There is a point at which the ported design in such a small scale can become ineffective when putting two drivers into such a small space . This makes me skeptical of the the Shure 2 way product as well , I understand why its a challenging to make both drivers sound correct to my ear thru the same pipe into my ear canal . Stay tuned .  
2	  We have had our Canon S400 for about 4 months & it has been wonderful - as well as the Canon battery . The charge lasts for a pretty long time . We bought a generic battery ( from an individual seller off this site ) for a backup . It died in a little over a month . Don't bother trying to save money - just get the real thing ( which this is ) .  
1	  I needed a radio I could use to pickup a weak station next to a stong one . This one keep switching between stations . I returned it .  
2	  After reading reviews on this printer I almost didn't get it . But the price was to good to pass up on for a printer that does everything . And so far I haven't had anything go wrong or bad . I read that some people were having trouble loading the software . And maybe some paper issues , but that could have been on another printer or another site . Anyway , please see below for my install , I hope someone may find this helpful . 1st : Follow the guide install sheet , set up the printer with the paper , ink cartridges etc . ( also , go ahead and put it where it 's going to be , don't plug in the USB yet though ) 2nd : Load the software , can take a little time . This is where I ran into a slight issue . I got an error after the load , I kind of blew it off and thought it 's fine , it wasn't . I tried a couple of little things , nothing worked . So I went in and un-installed anything related to the HP printer install . Then I re-installed the software over , ( unplug the USB again before you do this if needed ) The second attempt worked , boom , printer was good to go . I suggest removing and re-installing the software if you run into any problems . Don't waste your time troubleshooting unless your bored . 3rd : The paper , I almost forgot , don't jam it in there to far , just place it gently . The entire setup maybe took me two hours , I 'm guessing though , I didn't time it . Good luck , and enjoy the printer , I give it 5 stars , I hope it doesn't prove me wrong :)  
2	  I purchased a couple of these and they seem to work fine even after while . The reason I replaced the other battery is that my sisters phones were making a strange noise and apparently it was not the batteries fault because these are working just fine  
1	  I bought the Apex AD1500 for a great price , and nine months later , it won't play any disks . Apex says it will fix the machine for [ price ] plus shipping . I can't get it fixed locally because Apex won't sell parts or service information to others . While it worked , it produced good entry level sound and picture . After all , digital is digital , but I 'll never buy another Apex product again .  
2	  I was looking for a case for my FZ50 to keep off the dirt when carting it around in the car and other places where grime is present . It serves the purpose just fine . The camera fits in the case without a without a problem . While this item might not provide enough protection in severely adverse situations , it works for me . I 'm glad I got it .  
2	  Well I got this antenna for my sedan ( an Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera ) because a W1000 or 500 would be way too big , this thing installed in 20 mins , and it was a breeze . It holds firm over 100mph on the highway with 15mph gust winds ( yes that old car can go that fast ) . No one has stolen it yet and I 've parked in some questionable neighborhoods . The cable was just long enough to reach the radio ( under dash on passenger side ) and had about 6 inches of slack . As for the technical details , I have not tuned it yet as my SWR meter has gone missing .. but on channel 6 I was picking up two drivers 20 miles away with no problem , and they read me loud and clear . All in all , 5 out of 5 starts .. it does what it says it does and more . For the price , it was a fantastic buy . ( Quick shipping from the seller too ) .  
1	  Purchased this monitor 2 years ago and now have issues with it . It is still under warranty , so this should be easy ! Afraid not . Customer service says No advance replacement after the 1st year , you have to PAY for one of their add on plans for that . You ship it back to them and they will repair it and then send it back . You get to pay shipping , you have to wait 7 - 10 days minimum from the time they get it for repair and then wait for it to ship back . Total time gone : 4 + weeks . And what are we supposed to do for a monitor in the meantime ? What packaging do you use if you do not have the original box . Can honestly say that after dealing with their terrible customer service , I will never buy Viewsonic again . Planar and Samsung have GREAT customer service . We purchased a Samsung to replace this monitor and when it comes back , will verify that it works and then give it to the kids to play with until it dies again .  
1	  I used to hate network uptime . When the LAN was up for more than a few days at a time , I would get angry and punchy . That has all changed , friends . Now that I have the Netgear GSM7324 , I don't have to worry about the network being up for too long ; it automatically kills the LAN on it 's own . The best part is , it is totally unpredictable , so each time my users yell " Hey , I can't get to wiki " or " Is there something wrong with the Internet ? " , it 's like a special surprise for everybody . I mean really , do you really _ need _ access to your gateway while trying to commit CVS at the end of the day ? And who wants to be able to read email while at work ? It 's much better to pay a bunch of software engineers and marketing consultants to sit idle while the IT guy is power cycling all the switches on the network trying to clear up whatever happy fun issue is taking down LAGs and VLANs one by one . Sure , I could have bought a Cisco , but that drab bluegreygreen color totally clashes with my server room . Also , there is my hatred of a stable network to consider . I 'm sure if I was just using this switch to do simple layer 2 stuff my LAN would stay up longer , but since I wanted to actually break the network as fast as ARP'ingly possible , I made sure to turn on some of the features Netgear claims this box can support . I would have given this unit a higher rating , but sometimes my network is up for nearly half a week before it dies . That 's nearly two and one half days without my users sitting idle while I troubleshoot , or going home early because they can't get anything done at work . One last advantage of using this Netgear " layer 3 switch " is their superb support team . I used to have to sit on the phone with other company 's support staff , getting answers to my questions , or offers to VPN in to take a look at the situation . Now , I am all smiles as I get the same exact say statement each time I call support . I don't have to worry anymore about getting help with the problem from a qualified network engineer type . Could you pass the Dosas ?  
1	  Worked fine .. ONCE . I got one so-so 20 minute capture from VHS ( picture was poorly aligned and sound was severly attenuated ) , after that I got no love ( same tape ) . Software locks up requiring the machine to be turned off ( unplugging the device didn't cut it ) , and it doesn't work any better when it 's turned back on . I can't comment on the customer support cause I 'm not going to deal with them .. this dud it going back . Maybe it 's unreasonable , but I expect relatively simple devices to work as advertised out of the box . What I 'm really fired up about is the software seems to have corrupted my machine .. my soundcard promtly stopped working correctly after install . I HATE trying to nerd my way through the obscure corners of my computer trying to right things that would not have been wrong if not for a bad product .  
2	  I got this for my man , who is BIG-TIME into smok'in .. Absolutley loves it ! He has quite a few friends out here in the Ocala National Forest ( where we live ) , and is always bragging about this product , and the great website where he found it , " smokercooking . com " .. to the other more critical reviews , all we can say is " get over it " ! It sure beats the Heck out of NOT having one .. and the price has actually dropped since our purchace !  
1	  I purchased this card to give USB 2 functionality to my Dell Latitude . The user " Manual " is one page , which fails to tell you anything you need to know , and seems not to describe the unit I bought , but possibly any one of a range of versions . It was unclear whether you should install the software or the card first . When I installed the card , the Dell seemed to recognise it , and a visit to " Device Manager " confirmed that a number of USB Devices had been installed . None of them were as described in the manual , and all seemed to be using generic Windows drivers . I plugged in a USB Mouse , which did not work . I then plugged in a USB Camera , which froze the Dell solid . Tried a Sony USB Recorder . Same result . I rebooted and attempted to install the software . The 3-1/2 " disk does not autorun , nor can it be ejected without shutting down and ejecting as you re-start . The drivers mentioned as necessary in the manual do not exist on the disk , and it is totally unclear from the sub-literate " Manual " why there would be 2 - NEC drivers to install , or how to install them . Doesn't matter . They don't exist . Stor 's site support is laughable . That too doesn't exist . What sort of failed businessmanship leads a company like Stor to even think people will accept this kind of product marketing and waste of their time ? It 's clear to this businessman that they would do themselves far less damage by not selling the product at all . And if Stor finds a seemingly good product that they wish to brand and market ( I assume they don't make the card themselves ) , why is it so hard to do 15 minutes of simple testing , and then , if you decide to go ahead , find a literate and technically competent person to write a simple manual ? Lots of people would do that for nothing . Sadly , I 'm returning this unit . I now have a very poor opinion of Stor .  
1	  The space bar has a lot of resistance , and after using this keyboard for one month , my thumbs are starting to hurt . Also , when I hit the space bar , I don't always get a space on the screen . I was hoping the space bar resistance would ease up after some use , but so far , its the same . I will admit that the rest of the keyboard feels fine . FYI , I am a small person , don't know if that has anything to do with my space bar issue .  
2	  This is a quality product that is both easy to install and use . Signal strength is excellent . I would definitely recommend thiswireless PCI adapter .  
2	  When I bought my laptop , I usually delete all the extra 's stuff that is installed on it . When I came to the Slingbox icon , I decided to see what it was about . I went to the web page and liked what I saw and decided to buy it . When I deployed to Iraq this past spring , I didn't get the box because the majority of the things I see that says " watch any where or use any where " it is usually for businessmen going in and out of the country for a few days . Well when i came home for R & R ; , I decided I 'm going to try it out and if it don't work over here , then at least I can use it for road trips . The minute I got back in country , I tried it , there was a problem with the connection , the first thing that came to my head was " I knew it , just like anything else that states it works anywhere , well it didn't " So when i got back to my actual living area , I tried it again , and man I was like a kid in the candy store ! I no longer had to watch AFN ( Armed Forces Network ) at all ! I was watching television from the states in Iraq ! The only draw back and I say again , the only draw back is the internet connection . At certain times of the day , the buffing is real slow , the video is choppy , but once it is on , it is on ! So , to all my brothers and sisters in arms , deployed or not , or if your family members that want to get you something in your " care " package , I highly recommend you tell them to get the Slingbox , or before you deploy or PCS overseas , purchase the Slingbox . You won't regret it ! They sell two types , get the one with the built in tuner , if not , you and your wife / husband will be fighting over witch show you are watching :) ( By the way , I am not getting a dime from this company at all , this is my way of " word of mouth " and endorsing a good product , the US Military has nothing to do with this or the Slingbox company . )  
1	  Be careful ! What seems to be a good price is actually not . You must have another $ 120 item to make this work .  
1	  Returned product since it did not keep out external sound as much as I was lead to believe by the item description .  
2	  I have no experience with video editing at all . I bought this product to transfer video from my Hi8 camcorder to my computer so I could burn it to DVD . With very little effort I transfered video from multiple tapes and made a dvd movie with titles and effects perfectly on the first try . For fellow computer challenged people like myself this is a great product ! I don't know how the software and features stack up against others , but if you want to make good quality , professional-looking DVDs without having to try to learn a complicated program and system , this product is a great choice !  
1	  The JVC Camcorder Model GR-SXM240 is one of the best I'veused in years . For the price you pay , you can't beat It . Sharp pictures even in low light conditions . I recommend thisCamcorder for every one to use . There is one problem while charging the battery the main circuitboard smoked . This board cost approx . $ 205.00 . I recommend watching the camcoder when charging .  
2	  Purchased this as a replacement for a Sony that got damaged in a fire . Great TV . The delivery service that Amazon used , however , wasn't up to the same level . They called and set a time of delivery between 12-4 . I called at 3:00 to check status . They told me 5:00 . When I called at 5:00 , they told me 7:00 . I had to go out so they had to deliver the next day between 10-12 . Called at 12:00 when they hadn't come yet . They eventually came around 12:45 .  
2	  You guys must be getting tired of hearing the same thing but : I have never been disappointed with anything I 've ever bought through Amazon or your sub-contractors . Price , quality , delivery time - all great . Amazon if the first place I go now before I buy anything - and it 's most often my last stop . T. Smith  
2	  When my original WRT54G router final gave up the ghost after almost 5 years of continous service ( telecomuting from my home office by day , internet surfing by night ) , I purchased a Linksys WRT120N wireless router locally because I needed to get back " on the air " quickly , What a total piece of crap the WRT120N turned out to be , I wish I had found and read the review at [ .. ] before wasting my money on itOk , so what does this have to do with a review of a Linksys WRT54L router ? Well , I want to also pass on a warning about the WRT120N and say why I ended up replacing it with a WRT54L.The WRT120N is a 802.11n router billed as being backwards with 802.11g but it is not ! It is very unreliable and after finding myself needing to constantly do a power off / on reset due to it sporadically " locking " up I decided it was high time to give it the boot after a few weeks of that nonsense and go back to a WRT54 series wireless router . The WRT54L couldn't arrive soon enough to replace the WRT12N and much to my pleasant surprise it showed up days ahead of the timeframe Amazon gave for the Super Saver shipping . The WRT54L is a tried and true WRT54 series router that uses Linux firmware instead of Cisco 's firmware . That opens up a whole new world in being able to tweak the router 's performance by installing a 3 party firmware such as DD-WRT , if desired . For me , that was not necessary as it provides a strong enough wifi signal to be able to connect from any area of my multi level home . But I sure like having that option available even if it 's not needed at this time , Installation was a breeze and a much improved process than what I went through with my original WRT54G router . Bottom line .. BUY THIS ROUTER if you are lookng for your first router or a replacement , you will not be disappointed .  
1	  I received this item as a gift . It doesn't hold the ipod well while in the kickstand mode . The bottom strap must be removed to access the lower port . To set it up in kick stand mode , you need to remove the ipod at least half way . Your movie will kill the battery before the movie will end , and there is no way to charge while watching with this case in kickstand mode .  
1	  I began this novel with high expectations . It was on the best-seller list and I had heard lots of buzz about it being the new Southern gothic . The beginning was intriguing - a little boy is found hung and no one knows who did it or why . Now , when a book begins with an unsolved murder , call me crazy but I expect that that murder will be solved by the book 's end . While the murder is never solved , the story is actually a cat and mouse game between the murdered child 's sister , Harriet , and the alleged killer . Never mind the fact that a child is not a match for a grown man . The rest of the book can be summed up in a few words : drugs , racism , and snakes . The murder is never solved . The reader never finds out what happened or why . After the end of the book , I thought that perhaps someone had torn some pages out of the book because there was no real conclusion ; it just ended . I can count the number of times I 've finished reading a book and felt my time had been wasted on one hand . This , unfortunately , was one of those times .  
1	  I really liked mu iLuv ear clips when I got them but , after only a few weeks they are falling apart ! First the ear cushions fell off and now part of the mechanism itself has disappeared . This is just from carrying them around . They do not hold up very well !  
2	  My wife 's favorite Christmas present was a replacement Salad Shooter . I know , not very romantic , but it 's what she asked for . She 's had one for many years and finally wore it out . Life without a Salad Shooter in our house is unthinkable !  
1	  Very slow processing , misses characters in the grafitti feature all the time , tiny screen with bad resolution - spend the extra $ for the next best unit . I 'm an avid Palm user ( this is my third Palm Pilot in 4 years ) and I tried to cut corners and save $ with this unit - don't do it . I 've since broken down and bought the Tungsten E2 - love that one and wish I would have just bought that to begin with .  
2	  We haven't had to use this product yet but its definitely well made , heavy construction with built in safety features . Everything you need for small batch canning , cooking or to sterilize is included minus the items you would expect to supply . Item arrived quickly . I don't believe the price can be beat on a pressure cooker of this size and quality .  
1	  This item worked great for about 5 min . Unfortunately , it died after that and only worked when plugged into a / c or USB port . Battery did not charge . Since I was really wanting to use this player for running , it was quite a disappointment . I gave it 2 stars for how I think it probably would work with a battery and for the semi-helpful customer service . However , I still haven't received my reimbursement after almost 2 weeks .. that 's a generous 2 stars .  
1	  I tried using these CD 's with the Philips Jackrabbit CD-Rewriter and they don't work .  
2	  Love my speakers . I use them with my computer and stream a radio station every day and they have great sound . With Bose you can't lose .  
2	  this thing actually works , it does take some real thought and time to program it , but the method is web based so it is not as tedious as teaching it with your other remotes . the problem is you have to envision your use scenario 's and then think them through .. It is somewhat cumbersome when you want to do non programed moves , but it does do it all , and has opened up some options not on my original Denon remote .. I have put my regular remotes off the top of the coffee table .. Some of the buttons could be reshaped for easier locating by feel .  
1	  ATI has apparently mislead me , their website implied that this card had drivers supporting it under Linux . Well they have drivers alright , but they don't work ! THe display is false colors and very streaky . I contacted ATI for support and their response was " We don't provide support for Linux , the drivers are provided As Is " It took me several months to come to the conclusion that I was going to be unable to configure this drivers and now I am stuck with a card that I cannot return . I feel ATI has lied and is being very unfair in having pushed the burden to discovering whether their card will or will not work , under Linux , off onto the user and simply said " Tough luck " If ATI implies that they have drivers for a card then they are obligated to support those drivers , it was on that basis that I bought this card .  
2	  decent okay not bad does the job sometimes doesnt connect sometimes sAYS it cant be connect sometimes its half way and it says its fully charged but over all a majority of the time its good  
2	  First , MY specs : AMD Athlon 64 X2 38002GB Ultra 400MHz PC3200 DDRAsus A8N32-SLI Dlx2x 250GB Seagate SATAAntec 550W PSUand , of course - PNY Verto Geforce 6600 PCIE 256MB DDR-if you dont understand , that 's really good ( and JUST because your computer has the same graphics card it might not perform as well as mine , esp . if it has different components ) - This has been a great performer for me , no problems whatsoever . I bought this at Best Buy for ~ 175 and now its almost a third of that . THE ONLY time its ever even stuttered was when I hooked it up to our 50 inch HDTV running Half-Life 2 - Lost Coast at 1080i .  
1	  I had to return this player twice and finally had to keep the third player as the warranty period expired . This is because I wanted it to work , ( really , really ) and did all I could before giving up on it . It 's a cool little mp3 player and , when it works , the sound quality is great , the screen is very sharp , and it has an appealing and easy to use interface . However it just doesn't work . Some may remember this player was originally billed as the " Rhapsody " player by Sandisk . It never , ever worked with Rhapsody , and Sandisk never acknowledged the problem or offered a solution , a total abdication of corporate resposibility to their clients . After numerous hours dowloading firmware , and re-booting , re-setting and returning to the store and trying again , I finally had to accept that this player , although a hugely appealing concept with great potential , would never work . I now have a very expensive , ( $ 140 + tax ) portable fm radio , which I really love by the way . Sandisk 's solution to this tale of woe , was to simply drop the " Rhapsody player " from the name and continue selling . If you do any research at all , you will find the message boards filled with countless clients complaining of the same difficulties : freezin up , an endless dowload indicator which never dowloads anything , an indication that the dowload is complete only to find that no content can be found on the player , etc . You may also find that not only Rhapsody users but regular mp3 users had similar trouble , I never did because I was not interested in using this as a regular mp3 player , so I never tried . I can't report on that , however the message boards are full of complaints . Oh , well . As much as I hate , and resist , hype of any kind : I should have bought an iPod . :-(  
1	  I 've owned my camera for just over one year .. the pictures were great .. for about 9 months then the camera started to rewind in the middle of a roll of film .. sometimes . I sent it back to Olympus during the warranty period and they returned it but it continued to rewind .. I 'm giving up and presently using disposables ..  
1	  Beware this unit is 6 ohm impedence . no use to me with an 8 ohm system  
1	  When I bought this player I thought what the heck , what couldgo wrong with it . besides the mechanical problems , it is an inferiormachine . the eject button is right next to the stop button , so if your fingers slip a touch , you have to close the tray again and find where you left off in the movie , therefore another awful problem : it won't remember where you left off at ! the booklet came apart in two days . it was half - # $ ! attached by two staples . and if the machine is unplugged , you have to reprogam your remote for your television , because it 'll forget the code ! it started screwing up on the matrix and I took it in to exchange it , since I bought the extended warrenty . needless to say it is heading off to the shop , and thank god for the no-lemon policy ! because I WILL keep sending it back ' till I get what I want . when I was at the service desk , I saw a panasonic and a sony DVD player brought in around the same time . it 's too late for me , but my advice to those who want a dvd now , please wait . it 's a new technology and many things are wrong with it .. if you must buy one , DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER . the price may be attractive , but it is garbage . stick to the two best names : JVC and sony . i regret for not waiting longer and making a more intellegent decision . RESEARCH ! don't get information from the sales people , read magazines and go to independent websites for the best player . ( i told them to test a bugs life on it to see if it would mess up ! )  
2	  This is my 3rd Palm product and I was hesitant to try it again but for the price thought it might help keep me organized . Unlike earlier models this one is super easy to see with a great color screen . It 's simple but it 's in this simplicity that it can accommodate my needs from keeping track of appts to shopping lists for different stores . It has already saved me a fortune in gasoline costs . When I need something I put it right in and when I 'm out I just pull out the Palm to ensure I pick up everything at once . The only downside was the sync software CD that came with the unit was defective . Once I downloaded directly from the Palm site I haven't had a problem since . I 'd surely go for a 4th palm after this one - in a few years .  
1	  Read the other reviews . I agree with all the negative comments , especially about it not having nonskip ability . I should have read the reviews first before purchasing the product .  
2	  This works ! It removed smears that an alchohol cleaning was only able to dissolve and spread evenly over my lens . This pen removed all residue and left my lens spotless .. it 's really amazing .  
1	  I received an ipod for Christmas and still cannot get it to work with my Windows XP . I have spoken to the customer service support people over the phone 5 times and they cannot help me . When I went to my local Apple store at Stoneridge Mall in Pleasanton , California the " Geniuses " at the Genius Bar were far from being a Genius . Especially when they said , " We had a lady come in here the other day and we just couldn't get the thing to work on her Windows laptop . Oh well . " They refused to take give me my money back even though they admitted that my computer just might not be able to support the ipod . You call that customer service ? I have learned more on the Amazon reviews of ipods about how to get this thing to work than from the * # @ % ing Geniuses at Apple . THIS IPOD IS AN IFRAUD !  
2	  I purchased a new battery pack right before our trip to Alaska . We did not have any problems and even forgot to charge it one night and it still performed all the next day . This is the second battery I have bought for my S300 . The first Canon battery pack lasted 5 years ( it came with the camera ) , the second battery ( first replacement ) - a Maxwell - lasted only one year . I will only buy a Canon battery pack from now on . The life span is much longer . The Canon Battery Pack cost a little more but it is worth it in the long run .  
1	  Purchased from Amazon on February 12 , 2007 . I used it for 3 years with some minor problems . When there were problems , I had to unplug this device and plug the USB device directly to the back fo the computer . However , recently it stopped working completely . Whenever I plug a USB device , it gives me a message saying the device hub is overloaded . When I plug the device directly to the computer , there is no problem . This happens when used with the power adapter ( obviously ) and with only ONE USB device being connected . I am not certain if 3 years is an acceptable life for electronic components ; it is not acceptable to me personally . I expect all my electronic purchases to survive a minimum of ten years . An expensive SONY MP3 CD player I purchased died after 17 months . So I completely stopped buying SONY products due to unreliable product life . I have had other problems with other LINKSYS devices , so I am begining to form a low opinion of this company 's products as well , and its product documentation tends to be very user unfriendly in general .  
1	  The sound quality was good with these earbuds , until they broke ! These earbuds are very cheap quality and broke the second time I put them in my ear . The dark0 gray , back casing just separated from the part where you put your ear in , and guess what ? There was just a small amount of glue holding it together . I expected more from Monster , which is usually a brand that makes a good name for itself , but this time , they let me down . Also , these are the old models and do not come with the thing to hold your two wires together when you are listening to music . I would not recommend this to anyone unless they want a good sound paired with very cheap quality .  
2	  I see a lot of people has given a very low rating for this unit , I cant talk bad about it ! I live where the roads are really damaged and the ASM-II works like a charm . The resume feature is great . Of course there are some bad units out there , like as in any other electronic gadget , you cant expect that all X-amount of units will be flawless . GET REAL ! However , as in performance this unit has behaved excellent , from driving in a dust and dirt road with bumps on a 4x4 at 125 kph , with no skipping , playing Marillion with no skipping , from shorts in the car 's electrical system ( once ) And it kept working ! I 'll recommended to anyone !  
1	  I only bought this cable because the price was cheaper . & # 34 ; you get what you paid for & # 34 ; that 's exactly what i got . The cable does not stream very good when i connect from my laptop to my 40 & # 34 ; Samsung TV . The movie or anything that i am watching would just black out every 2 min or so . It is so frustrating . i am not satisfied at all . All the stores i checked had very expensive cables . For 25ft it is very good price actually for the frustration is not worth . so i am just gonna have to buy from one of the stores .  
1	  I haven't bought many high end remotes , and I picked this one up for only $ 125 . Unfortunately I would rather use my Scientific Atlanta DVR remote to control my entertainment system . The button mapping is very poor not to mention the number buttons are very flat so I pretty much have to look down at the remote to see which number my thumb is on . The buttons feel like a cheap plastic when you press them . The volume and channel buttons are horrible positioning and very small ! The mute button is right on top of the ^ Volume button and it is seamless so my thumb slips and hits it all the time . Basically the layout can use a huge makeover . The programming feature is very advanced and not as easy as some of these reviewers claim it to be . You have to download the Harmony software , create an online account , and fill in the manufactures and model # to anything you want programmed . So pretty much if you don't have an e-mail you are crap out of luck with this remote . I had problems finding my model # for my fan because I installed it 2 years ago , so that won't be programmed . There is also a pretty cool feature for activities which programs multiple devices to act on a click of a button . The problem with my TV " Olexia " is that when I chose an activity it won't change the input mode , and this pretty much render these activities useless for me . The return channel button also doesn't do anything for my cable box " Explorer 3250HD " . These little things add up to a huge disappointment when this is supposed to be my universal remote . Not to mention that the color screen looks like a cheap 1st generation cell phone screen . The remote is very cool in concept , but there is a reason why it has dropped so dramatically in price . This remote after only 4 days , already has something lose in the remote that is bouncing around inside of it ; and I didn't throw / drop the remote in frustration , even though I have thought about it .  
2	  With 3 weeks under my belt with my new Canon Digital rebel XTi 10.1 MP SLR , I can only say I remain thrilled and happy with my purchase . With my last quality camera purchase being a Canon SLR in the early 70 's , I have been blown away by how " smart " this camera is and how easy to use . One can use it in automatic mode and not worry about the technical aspects , or go deep into manual customized photography . This camera is a great deal , and everything as advertised . Can't wait to add a zoom !  
1	  i bought this because i wanted an extra adapter . i never touched it and left it in the box for about 3 months . i finally opened the box and tried it out . it worked perfectly for about 10 minutes . then it started losing power and then it just stopped working . i know there is nothing wrong with my laptop because it works fine with my other adapter . i feel like i 've been ripped off . if you 're thinking about buying one i recommend you go to HP . com and buy one there .  
1	  I don't normally write these things , but this is a special case .. I have 7,000 + MP3s . The bundled software - which MUST be used to transfer files to the player - took well over two hours to create a library . Even WMP can do it in less than 15 minutes . So far , so bad . Once I finally got a library created , I found that I could not use my MP3s without a time-consuming and glitchy conversion to what ( I think ) is a proprietary Sony format . This is crap . I returned this player and got a Samsung YP-T7J , which I am very pleased with . Drag-and-drop , no terrible ( and boy do I mean TERRIBLE ) bundled software supplied or required , and no compatibility surprises . Skip this one , people . It 's REALLY bad .  
1	  These things are cheap , and it shows . The set arrives with tabs too compressed , which means the connectors will not stay in any jacks of their own accord ; they will break contact and pop out of the jack from nothing more than the springiness of the jack 's contacts . They can be forced to stay in by using a boot similar toRJ45 Gray Color Strain Relief Boots ( 50 Pcs Per Bag ) and slipping the tab outside the boot ( using the boot to force the tab to click and lock ) , but if you ever need to unplug a cable with this connector and using this hack , you must remember to slip the tab back under the boot before pulling the cable out through the inevitable rat 's nest . The connector 's crimp , which is supposed to grab the cable shielding , is very weak . It broke off of the very first connector I crimped from this set under less than standard strength . The contacts pierce the wires and make acceptable electrical contact , but that 's about this item 's only redeeming quality . The only other redeeming quality is that the seller ships extremely fast . This item arrived with standard shipping with the speed I would expect from express shipping , many days ahead of the rest of the order . The only reason I would ever have for buying this item again is if everyone else in the world was sold out of connectors . This is not worth the price , even as low as it already is .  
1	  I have purchased refurbished models that have lasted for years , but the HP 1320 is a piece of junk . The company has been of no help . I have called HP direct and they let me know that I purchased a printer that is broken . I am out over $ 150 and still have to purchase a printer  
1	  I ordered this for the bathroom to keep up with the weather while brushing my teeth in the morning . Wonderfully small , like a deck of cards . Exactly what I was looking for , BUT it did not work all the time ! It would cut out after 2 or 3 seconds , or not work at all , so returned it ( with ease , full refund , and no problems ) and ordered the same manufacturer , but the analog version . Same size , similar look and I really like it . I 'm sure I would 've liked this one , too , if it had worked properly .  
2	  With my ancient Matrox G550 card , I was reassured by its presence on the compatibility list at Samsung , and indeed it 's flawless . In digital mode the full resolution is not available - it 's necessary to use the Analog cable to connect to the primary slot on the right of the card . Doing that , I get the full 1200x1920 from the 244T , while still being able to drive my ancient Dell 19 " at its full 1600x1200 , from the secondary connector using the d-to-a adaptor . 24-march-2007 , using " Lucida Sans " 8-point with ClearType turned on , I now see 155 lines of C + code in those 1920 vertical pixels - I can never go back ! Blue screen PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA from SAM_G400DHD . dll . This dll turned out to be the ( ( MagicRotation Display Driver ) ) , rather than the actual Display Driver itself which being knowledgeable I had instantly upgraded - using that Google Query I was led to download the new version 1.0.0.7 today , which will presumably fix that PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA . 30-march-2007 - SAM_G400DHD . dll same Blue Screen again - well I have always had that " control-S " habit , reinforced now . Samsung 's website is very nice , I submitted the minidump to them , I will update this . POSSIBLY this is a CAUTION - it MAY be an interaction with my ancient system , which they MAY never fix , time marches on .. 12-april-2007 - No response from Samsung . I can live with this problem , which has happened about 3 times in a couple of weeks , ALWAYS with the left-mouse-button down , dragging a top-level-window towards the bottom of the screen . That such drags fail only rarely seems to confirm that some kind of internal datastructure is overflowing , likely due to the limited RAM inside the G550 , so this may never fail on later cards with more RAM .  
2	  this is a great product .. straightforward directions , wonderfully executed concept . IF .. you have a stud or cement walls . we were unable to find a stud in the location we wanted to hang the monitor , so we thought we 'd use the included anchors to hang it from the drywall . unfortunately , the anchors that are included are only for cement , so we had to go purchase special heavy-duty drywall anchors . i purchased a few different kinds and only one fit through the pre-drilled holes . it was a minor inconvenience and the product is great .  
1	  I 'll admit that I purchased the Swingyde based on the reviews i read . Bad mistake . I play golf at least once a week . In my opinion this is priced 25 bucks too much . It mainly helps you hinge your wrist on the back swing and nothing else . There is SOO much more to a golf swing than hinging your wrist ! My opinion - pass on this product and get some lessons - preferably an instructor that records your swing and analyzes it with you one on one afterwards .  
1	  So far I 've called three times and sent one email . It has been four business days . Just got a phone mail message to call back if I still have problems . Support is not acceptable . The product performs as advertised , relatively easy to setup . My problem is that it went braindead at 6 months  
2	  I have owned several different brands of flash drives , some good , some failed within a few weeks . Kingston ALWAYS works , lasts , and is a great value . I am a big fan of all Kingston memory products .  
2	  This is one rockin device . You can load all your favorite movies , clips , and music videos . This is in addition to Music and Audiobooks . Be advised that watching vieo uses the battery much quicker than music .  
2	  This case is great . It fits my Canon S30 perfectly . The Tamrac 5694 case is recommended for the Canon S30 but that is really the wrong case for the Canon S30 because it is way too big . Case Logic CPS40 Koskin is really the perfect case . It fits the camera just right . The case is small and compact . It fits the camera snugly but leaves just enough room to fit a media card and lens cloth . No , this case does not have any pockets or fancy compartments but in my opinion this would make the case too bulky . This case has a convenient belt loop instead a shoulder strap or strap that fits around the neck . I think the belt loop is much more practical . You don't have to worry about mistakingly leave the bag somewhere or lugging it around . All and all this is a great case not just for Canons but for any compact digital camera . Plus the price is excellent .  
2	  This works great , but the range is a load of bull . It works up to about 6 miles . It might work at 12 miles if you were on the ocean or a lake , but that 's about the only way 12 miles is possible . Works great and highly durable .  
1	  Volume control stopped working the morning after we unpacked it . Now it works only on high , with lots of static . I wasn't expecting much sound quality at this price point , but this product is ridiculously shoddy .  
2	  What the cable companies provide in 1Ghz cheapo coaxial splitters is insufficient to get the best TV picture quality , particularly if one has several coaxial cable connections relating to TV 's and broadband internet . I found in using the increased bandwidth of the Monster splitters of 2Ghz having improved the sharpness of analog and digital cable TV reception . Additionally , as more people are opting for HDTV sets and broadband internet connectivity , reducing signal loss will provide one potential improvement relating to multiple connections . Other issues relate to dirty AC power interference and the quality of the cabling used , ( such as superior performance in S-Video or composite cables ) , so the solution to maximize your signal quality is multifaceted . It is recommended to use either the 2 or 3 splitter variation . The 4-splitter model has more signal loss . Use the splitters at the entry point and where one splits coax between the TV and other components such as DVD / DVR 's .  
1	  It does get both my desk tops to work , but it kicks me off line continueosly . I had to write this review 4 times . Not very happy .  
2	  I bought this camera after owning the original film rebel and then a Canon Powershot s50 . I have been in love with this camera since it came out of the box . It is the perfect size for my small hands , but still feels solid and sturdy . It is very fast , takes wonderful photos and is very easy to use . I was on the fence between this camera and a comparable nikon model . I 'm so glad that I stuck with Canon . I have an online business and spend a lot of time photographing my items . Owning this camera has taken the process from something I dread to something that I genuinely look forward to . Thank you Canon !  
1	  The Colorado Map series does not display the same detail as a real 1/24000 official USGS map . I wonder which Colorado maps that National Geographic scanned ? Hopefully I might be able to use the GPS and way points with my Garmin GPS 72 , however the software setup does not list the Garmin GPS 72 . I must have received last years version .  
2	  The is the best universal remote controller that I have ever seen . It is very easy to setup and is working shortly after removing it from the box . It uses macros to startup devices and change channel inputs . If for some reason a device didn't respond correctly , there is a " help " touch screen button that you can easliy access the device that needs attention . This doesn't happen but on a rare occasion , but very easy to recover . You can have it setup to sleep , to save battery power , the second you pick it up the screen lites up . It 's worth the price . I have had many different Universal Remotes , this is the best one .  
2	  If your are looking for a really tiny flash drive this is it . Mine has work great mos t of the time except for a couple of times when the PC cannot recognize the the flash drive but I think the problem is the usb port . The only downside is the color but tht really dosen't matter .  
1	  Unfortunately , this product could never complete the scan for available wireless networks . It always failed . Therefore , I could never complete the process of hooking it up . I wasted my money on this product and had to go with the plug adaptors that make your electrical wires of the house act as hard wiring . This review won't let me enter a rating of 0 stars but that is what I give it .  
1	  I just bought a Panasonic Palmcorder model PV-L750 . It came with a program ' Digital PhotoShot ' but it .. well .. rots . And there is no other driver on the disc except for the one that goes with that program . I 've been looking everywhere for a driver to install the camera in Windows . I already have a great graphics program . All that I need to get to use it with the camera is the driver . I 've tried the Panasonic site and emailing them about it .  
2	  I am wanting to know what kind of speaker wires these have . Are they two bare wires or a jack . I have a stereo I need to replace the speakers and don't see that anywhere on description .  
2	  Good memory stick , handy and small , of course . There is a switch on it to switch from side a to side b . The switch is really tiny , so if you have big fingers , you might have a little trouble . It seems a little flimsy and is really tiny to use , and also to read the lettering . I wouldn't recommend it to someone that forgot their reading glasses . It is a timesaver , and a spacesaver , and there aren't really many other options for those of us who can't use the newer memory sticks . All in all , a good product .  
1	  Tons of static and I have a direct line running from this into my car stereo ( NOT FM TUNER ) . It charges fine and cuts off ipod when I turn off engine but the amount of static makes it unusable . I would have been better off with just a cheap charger for the car .  
2	  Replaced a couple of basic power strips with this . Looks better & I feel better about using this instead of the power strips . Hope I never have to find out if this protects better or not . Price was better than what I could find locally . Shipping was timely & product arrived before delivery date . Would order again from this seller .  
1	  HAVE I TAKEN THINGS APART IN THE PAST AND THEY WORKED ! You better ask yourself that question before you start or your in deep doodoo . The instructions are very small and you 'll need a magnifying glass to read them AND they are not complete ! Please google taking apart an iPod before you start or you are already in trouble . I didn't disconnect one group of paper thin wires and ruined my iPod BUT I got a better unit ( read my reviews ) . My advice , its cheap BUT you better know what your getting into ..  
1	  This is my second pair of these earphones and the 2nd pair that one of the wires has pulled loose and cannot be re-inserted to get stereo sound . While they were working they were great but if you cannot keep them together there is a big problem with the design .  
1	  This product is a piece of junk . After six months the screen went black . Polaroid has a 90-day warranty so our options are take it to a repair shop or pay Polaroid $ 110 for a replacement unit . Avoid this product .  
2	  I BOUGHT THESE TO GO ON A CRUISE AND THEY WORKED GREAT . GREAT QUALITY AND THE PICTURES SHOWED UP VERY NICELY . WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE .  
1	  I was so happy when I purchased the Kensington 33199 Digital FM transmitter and Auto Charger . Within two days after I received it , I became sick to my stomach . The darned thing fried my IPOD Nano . I read the reviews before I purchased and it seemed to be exactly what I wanted . I had returned two earlier purchased products that I got from Walmart , because there was too much noise , and while in the city I could not even find a good FM channel with no drift and fade . This product certainly delivered there . But I did not see any warning that I could not leave the product plugged in with my IPOD attached . The third time that I turned it on , it played for about a minute and then stopped . I looked down just in time to see the battery ICON in the IPOD disappear and I knew that my IPOD was fried . I was so happy after purchasing the tuner that I had thrown out all the shipping material . Foolishly . Now I can't even return the product , I am sure that they won't take it back . I learned a hard lesson . But you don't have to make that mistake .  
1	  Apart from it 's clumsy primitive user interface , this unit has two tragic flaws : 1 - The on screen displays ( program guide , info screen , setup menus , channel display , etc . ) do not work when using the DVI port when the resolution is set to 1080i ! You 're totally flying blind , with no visual way to set or confirm settings or channels . Samsung has confirmed that it is designed this way , but could offer no explanation why ! This reason alone is enough to stay away from this model . 2 - The Dolby Digital implementation doesn't work correctly . When using the optical or coaxial digital output , while set to Dolby Digital output , the audio drops out repeatedly and constantly . It will usually work fine for a few minutes , then it starts cutting in and out . Changing channels will clear it up for a few more minutes , but the problem quickly returns . The only way to get functioning digital audio is to set it to PCM , but then of course you can't decode Dolby 5.1 broadcasts . Samsung has confirmed this design flaw , but offers no solution . Check with ww . avsforum . com , and you 'll find countless pissed off Samsung owners . Go with a unit from Zenith , LG or Motorola , you 'll be much happier .  
2	  Shipped on time however USPS dragged their feet with it . Received 2 days later than expected . Works fine . Charges fine .  
1	  I had this unit for about a week before it died . It was plugged into a surge protector .  
1	  I 've been using Taiyo Yuden for the last eight years , both for my DVDs that I burn on my computer and in a Sony DVD recorder that I use on a daily basis . The first five disks , while they are genuine Taiyo Yuden disks , wouldn't finalize in the Sony DVD recorder . 0 for 5 . Thank goodness Amazon is accepting them as defective . Not sure what the problem is , but these aren't up to the standards that I expect .  
1	  This product was a big disappointment , since the 1st roll was empty . This product was not packaged , as viewed , so that 's where some of the problem enters . The 3 rolls were loose in a box . Thanks to Amazon . com for getting my money back . This is the first ( and I hope last ) product received through Amazon . com that I have been disappointed with .  
2	  Cheap and it works . I have my phone line going into my cable modem . Another line comes out to the house for the phone . I needed a 3rd input for the fax machine . It works . What else can be said about something like this ?  
1	  Photograph shows 1 spindle pack of 50 disks . That 's not what you get . You will receive 1 single disk . Mine arrived damaged .  
1	  Strengths : Looks Great . Great Idea . 802.11b integrated ! WOW ! Weaknesses : Looks don't matter . The idea fell on its face . 802.11b failed . No more wow . Summary : I have a running DHCP 802.11b network access point running infrastructure mode on channel 6 with an ssid called lynksys . All settings were carefully dynamically configured and then manually entered with no success whatsoever . none . nil . poop . Soo .. So anyway , all my other 802.11b network interfaces / machines work flawlessly . Sigh , what a headached . If the technology is not ready yet , then Toshiba don't market it .  
2	  . . . where I had no access with my old wireless card . I didn't change my router , just the card . I have a medium signal up here , two stories and about 40 yards from the router . The signal is more than enough to compute comfortably and without hassle . The software installed quickly , and after the card was installed it found my network immediately . A goof proof installation that took no time at all . Nice product !  
2	  I was just looking for some back up HDMI cables and found these . What an incredible price . They arrived quickly and were exactly what I ordered .  
1	  So far as I can tell , there is no problem with the camera case , but it is too big for the PowerShot S100 , and not big enough to hold the camera and charger . I 'm returning one I recieved as a gift - this could be the perfect case for another camera .  
1	  For $ 120 I was expecting some sense of durability , that Shure wasn't just another Sony , and that the money spent would go towards materials that didn't fall apart after 3 months of use . I bought a pair back in March ' 08 to replace some buds that I 'd used for over 5 years . 5 years may seem like a long lifespan for consumer electronics nowadays but I 've owned to pairs of buds that lasted that long without any problem . The Shures sound great and do a decent job of blocking out sound . The variety of sleeves for the drivers guarantee a good fit without discomfort and the sound is good enough considering the size of the driver themselves . Today I noticed my first major problem . Either the aforementioned weight of the cord or cheap materials used in the insulation itelf has caused small stress cracks in the cable that loops over my ear , cracks that will only worsen in time and lead to the complete deterioration of the insulation around the copper . This is incredibly unsatisfying and only serves to drive me back to a cheaper brand . I 'm never paying this much for headphones again . Judging on sound alone I 'd give these Shure 's a solid four stars . But seeing as how they are rapidly growing ugly cracks in the insulation before even four months have passed , they fail any kind of value test . I 've paid a quarter of the price for Aiwas that lasted 5 years . It 's infuriating to see my Shures fail me like this .  
2	  I have used these headphones for years for competitive gaming . They have great sound quality and are comfortable enough to wear for hours at a time . If they had a microphone they would be absolutely perfect . The ear pads are not large enough to cover the entire ear so the noise isolation is not as good as some other headphones .  
1	  It is a shame that Altec could easily have made this a five-star unit , but chose instead to do sleazy cost-cutting garbage just to squeeze a few more pennies ' profit . There are two things wrong with this unit , which sounds great for the money by the way . The first thing is that the on / off switch does not turn the woofer off . The second thing is that there is no shielding inside the unit to prevent it from picking up radio interference . So basically this thing is on 100 % of the time unless you unplug it . It picks up clicking noises from every cell phone anywhere in its vicinity , plus any other local radio noise . In short , it 's just maddening and so I would not recommend it to anyone . Oh yes there 's a third thing . The woofer is glued together so you can't open it to fix either of these problems by installing a switch or lining the interior with RFI-suppressing copper foil . So basically it 's a total loss . I 've put up with this unit for several years because I can't make myself spend the bucks to replace something that mostly works . This morning I was lying in bed and heard the woofer blasting out a nearby police radio transmission , so I decided I 'd had enough . I went to the hardware store and installed in in-line rocker switch on the power cord . So finally we 've got the problem mostly beat . Of course the unit will still broadcast RFI whenever we have it on , but at least now we can turn it off . I give it one star because of the sleaziness of the whole thing . This sort of cheapo construction fools you in the showroom because the unit sounds so great . It 's only after you get it home that you realize that it has serious long-term usability problems and that given the choice , you 'd never even consider the same unit again . But of couse for most people it 's not worth their while to return it , so the manufacturer gets away with it . Shame on you , Altec-Lansing . Another formerly great name down the tubes , sold out to lousy design and short-term profit .  
2	  I found this unit easy to hook up ( even though I have a satellite box and cable ) . Though there 's a lot to read in the manual , I was able to start recording my VHS tapes to DVD on the same day ( probably within an hour ) . So far the unit is doing exactly what I wanted it to do . The DVD recordings have the same quality as the VHS tape from which you are recording . The only thing I have been unable to figure out is how to get rid of commercials that might be on my VHS ( when taping to DVD-R ) . I have yet to try recording to DVD-RW , which might be different since it is rewritable . I am definitely pleased with this purchase .  
1	  This company does not live up to their promises when supporting their products . Once they sell you a product , you are essentially on your own if if breaks or does not work as advertised . I do not recommend purchasing ANY of their products . They will leave you high and dry !  
1	  The sound quality of this product is wonderful but if I just put my head down to see what I am sewing in my lap , it falls off . If I am cooking and I glance down , it falls off . This is ridiculous . Do they not test these ? I would not buy this product again . What good is good sound quality if they are sitting on the floor ?  
1	  Maybe it 's me , but I have trouble when it costs me more to ship something than it does to buy it . I canceld my order for these cables when I saw the outrageous shipping ( I know , handling ) costs . Note also this item does not qualify for free super-saver shipping . These are inexpensive enough - they should have made the item a buck more and the shipping a dollar less - that would have seemed less sneaky .  
2	  I have had good luck with the SAN-360 FM Transmitter I am using from Maximo , so I decided to purchase the S42 sync and charging cable so I could leave my original cable at my desktop on my home computer and use the S42 when I travel out of town with my laptop . The S42 cable works just like the original that came with the e250 and the only way I can tell them apart is the stamp on the connector . The original says SanDisk and the other says Maximo . If you are looking for an additional or replacement cable , I highly recommend .  
1	  I don't understand the good reviews of this headset even if they were given when the product first came out . They are cheaply made and very difficult to connect to any standard bluetooth driver . The sound quality is poor as well .  
1	  The review announces this item to be able to read US DVD as well as European . It 's wrong . The first thing you discover on the box is : " This DVD only plays DVDs from the US " !  
1	  Avoid this junk . This router will not last long . Belkin 's customer supprt is terrible : they somehow manage for you not getting any help because their so-called technicians have no idea about the basics of computer , the internet , the DSL , not to mention the router technology . Avoid Belkin !  
1	  I was about to buy this one to connect my laptop to a TV . But after looking at all other reviews , I came to know this is not the product I require . Thanks to all for the information . The correct title should be " RCA Component RGB to VGA Cable "  
1	  Problem one : I spent money to by the synch for Outlook , but the function doesn't work . Either I get a communication error on the Rolodex , or the I am told to press an " RX " button on the organizer , a button which doesn't exist as far as I am concerned . THe Instruction Manual gives no information about how to synch and the software that comes with the cable to allow sychronization has no help option . Worthless  
1	  Not sure what to say .. delivery was good , but the product itself .. not sure whose fault it is that I still have not installed this freakin ' thing so it actually works : seller 's or producer 's ! TRENDNET customer service is horrible ! DO not EVER buy their product . I am trying to fix this hardware with them for over three weeks , and the only I got is over more than 10 new case # , working with 1st level technicians who do not know what they are actually doing , but are reading printed directions . they made me do the same thing I did myself twice before that - installing the driver - even first time computer user would know to do that , but they read directions and made me wait for more than 5 minutes for more than 20 times , sometimes three time during one phone call . 2nd level technicians does the same thing , and 3 level that suppose to call me more than 72 hours ago , and I still haven't received a call from them . Device still does not work ! After I called them again to ask why they are not calling me back , they told me to send an e-mail to [ .. ] or something like that ! come on ! + the phone number of the customer service in the booklet is not correct . they tell you to do some stupid things that does not work as well , so I needed to search for the correct number ! and the tone of the voice of some technicians was so pretentious , like we , customers , are the dummiest idiots ever , but they are the ones that are reading directions ! =)  
1	  I use several different types of cards for my camera and PDA , so I figured this would be a great thing to have . Installation is very easy , especially under Windows XP , where it it true Plug-and-Play . For other systems there is a CD with drivers included . What is supposed to happen is that when it installs is that it will maps an addition four drives onto your computer ; one for each slot . Unfortunatly it does not seem to be able to map the Smart Media drive . Even after installing the drivers off of the disc it was not able to read the SM drive . I had two of these things ; the first I exchanged for a new one after it failed to read anything . On the first one the slots weren't mounted to the face plate correctly , so when I put in the Smart Media card it fell into the back of the device and I had to spent five minuets shaking the thing out . The second one I got was mounted correctly , but unable to read the SM cards . While it could read the Secure Digital card , it erased everything on it . Fortunatly I only had a couple of files on it , but a lot of people use SD cards for storing programs or pictures , and they would have lost everything if they used this . The Compact Flash card was the only one that worked reliably , but even that one I had problems with since it was difficult to jam the card all of the way into the slot . I am very dissapointed with this device and with Viking , who usually makes good products . Most people don't use all six types of cards , so a lot of them would go to waste , so I would recomend just getting seperate readers for each card . It 'll cost more , but probably worth it in the long run . On a side note , I would just like to say that Amazon . com has an excellent No-questions-asked return policy . After I asked to replace my first one they paided the return postage and sent me a new one two days later .  
2	  I bought these to wear while running , and am really happy with them . My main focus was on fit , and I have no complaints . The twist-to-fit design really works . I 've always had problems with in-ear headphones ( like the ones that come with the ipod ) falling out . These stay snugly in place without even the suggestion of coming loose . Also , I wear glasses , so headphones that stay in place by looping over the ear can be a little unwieldy / uncomfortable . These solve that problem as well , because nothing has to go over your ear . All in all I am very pleased with the headphones and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for headphones that will stay securely and comfortably in place during exercise .  
1	  I inserted batteries and took four pictures . The camera would no longer work . I went to the battery store and bought new batteries specifically for a digital camera . It would still not even turn on .  
2	  Well , I don't have much to say about this product , except that it works well and it does what it promises .  
2	  Item was shipped on a timely matter and when I got it was as advertised new in package well pleased over all .  
1	  Never received product so can't review - supposedly post office error . Will not order with the company again though since they do not insure their shipping .  
2	  It has many compartments to put the necessary equipment and or papers for a school teacher to bring to work with .  
2	  This product is really easy to install and I was very satisfied . It took about 5 minutes to snap together and place around the stereo unit . Installed in a 2008 Suburban .  
1	  I have the same problem in 2/3 of the cars I 've tried it in . The springy center part does not spring out correctly leaving only intermittent contact . I got Garmin to sent me a second one free , but it has the same problem ! This makes 3 total , since I had one of the older style ones with the COM port for my older unit . I had to fix that one using the spring from a ball point pen . It 's not just in my car either . I 've used other car adapters without any problem .  
2	  I 'll be the first to tell you that the Rio Cali 256 is a great sports player for jogging , gym workouts , or any short activities . But there are some flaws that must be addressed . First off , the radio tuner : One of the main reasons I bought this player was for this capability . I thought that even with a limited ( 256 mbt IS limited compared to gigabyte ipods , even though you can add memory cards ) memory . However , the tuner isn't as great as I thought it would be . I had never had a tuner on my cd player , but compared to a jogging radio , this one sucked . The static is almost too much to bear , and moving around caused more of it . If you find a good connection , though , and stay within that connections reach , the tuner works great . Secondly , the file transfer is somewhat tedious . I find that on some songs , when I try to transfer it , the program give me an error that I have yet to find the answer or patch for . The player says to unconnect and reconnect , but that does nothing . The solution ? To unplug your player , leave it alone for an hour , and come back later . Some songs never can transfer , even if you do do the above . Although this is somewhat of a small and maybe personal beef , the player 's joystick is annoying after awhile . I 've had the player for over six months , and the joystick has really gotten on my nerves . The point on the top that serves to provide grip hurts the finger used on after sometime . Although it is bearable , it seems annoying , considering if you are using the joystick to find options in the player 's capabilities , and you have to skip around a lot . Your thumb ( or whatever you use to navigate the player ) , will begin to have a feeling as if its still pushing down hard , long after it was done playing around with the thing . This could be just that I was pushing down on it too hard , but I thought I 'd bring it up anyway . Now onto the good . This player is soo easy to use . Navigating the functions is clearly labeled , and even technologically impaired users could easily transfer music if they have a lot of patience . The buttons on the player itself aren't clearly labeled , but once you play around with it and learn their functions , surfing your files , stopwatch , and radio , along with the many options , is pure ease . The USB connection is simple - just plug in and turn it on . The transferring program has many options , along with ease of use . The expandable memory ( using memory cards to hold more songs ) is easy to switch from different cards you have - all you need to do is pop the back , pull out the battery , and slide in or pull out the card . The durability of the player is great - the rubber coating prevents any major scratches , and protects the LCD from all harm-doers . The battery life is superb - one AA battery gets me through almost a month of frequent listening . Overall , if you want a small , durable player that is easy to use and has some good features for sports , but don't mind about radio inconsistencies and some program problems , the Rio Cali 256 is for you . But if you are looking for a large hard drive , dependable player , check out the Dell one or the ipod .  
2	  man this is better than going to gamestop and buying one man this is so coolthanks best regards ] Dhawi  
1	  Don't buy this if you have Windows 7 , as majority of household 's do these days . There is no driver for this for Windows 7 , and the product itself has been discontinued .  
2	  Needed to replace my Pioneer PLA-25 turntable from 1972 to play my vinyl . This turntable works very well for low price and a lot of plastic . It isfully auto with a dampened dust cover and a metal turntable with rubber mat . Be forewarned that RC wires to A / V are short and you may need to have to add extensions . The preamp cannot be turned off either . It soundsgreat and I should be able to replace the needle for under 10 dollars . Has a speed adjust but have not had to use it . Very happy with it .  
2	  The Asus M2N-SLI Deluxe is probably my favorite mobo that I have ever owned . Right now i am running Windows 7 Pro . 64-bit , and 8GB of RAM . I have an AMD Phenom II X4 940 , three 500GB hard drives , and dual nvidia 8800gts gpu 's ( sli linked ) . I have not had ONE single problem with it . When I got this mobo , i originally ran an AMD phenom X4 9500 with 2GB RAM and windows Vista home 32-bit , and was leary on whether the board would accept the upgrades that i made . But everything worked out with no issues . update : 3/17/2012 , still running just fine .  
2	  As the other reviewers have said , they do sound great , but they allow too much sound to escape . I planned to use them at work , but I can't because of that . Get the ear canal types , or the headphones with an enclosure around the entire ear .  
2	  I 've had my Visor Deluxe for only two weeks , and It 's already a vital part of how I keep my life organized . The graffiti writing was very easy to learn , there are only a few of the symbols that I am still trying to memorize . I tend to switch between graffiti writing and the keyboard , depending on how much writing . The HotSync does not work well when doing it between two visors . Sometimes it gets frozen when using two visor that are not compatible . For the Sync to work well , one should have both machines with the same amount of memory . The palm software was easy to load on to my Mac , and hotsyncing the information between Visor and Mac is a breeze .  
2	  I have been using my BEL 936 Express for 3 years now ( paid $ 95 new in 2002 ) . I drive like a maniac . The only ticket I have gotten since I started using this was at 5am and the cop driving down the other side of the road didn't have his radar on until he saw me come along . The BEL 936 picked it up right away after he turned it on , but by then it was too late . No radar detector will be able to detect radar that isn't on . I have to say that the guy who left the review in November of 2004 ( below this one ) gave it bad reviews , but he isn't even reviewing the same product . He says right there in his review that he was using a different model . Likewise , there was another negative review in relation to another BEL model , not the 936 Express . The reason some of these detectors stopped working is likely do to the users leaving it out in the sun while they are not in their cars . The heat will destroy the electronics eventually . To avoid this , take it down when you go inside . Put it under the seat or in the console . I get a few false positives on X-band , but Ka and K are always reliable . I use " CITY X " mode almost always unless I 'm on the highway . I have detected laser with this unit . I have picked up K and Ka as far as 3 miles away on the open road while driving across Louisiana in the middle of nowhere . The only problem I have had in the past 3 years is the speaker died . I ordered a new speaker from BEL for $ 7 including shipping . I installed it myself and now the unit works like a charm again . I highly recommend this . They are really cheap on eBay now . You can get them for under $ 40 brand new .  
2	  My wife has a PT Cruiser and I have a Jeep Wrangler . I bought this for one , but it ended up only fitting the other . My suggestion is look up the correct part number at Scosche for your vehicle and buy it here . The vehicle mapping here is not correct .  
1	  I didn't have a good experience with this product . Didn't function that well . I get better results from brining along a big ziploc bag during my runs and putting my ipod in the ziploc bag if it starts to rain .  
1	  My personal bad experience was more on the delivery side . I read " white glove " service . WHAT white glove service ? FIRST , I watched the ONE delivery guy drop my tv as he was unloading it . He didn't see me so I waited for him to tell me he dropped it and to offer to check it over with me . NO .. he brought it into the house and was in a rush to leave . Didn't say a word OR offer to check it for me . SO , I told him I saw him drop it and that he had to help me look it over . WELL , it turned on yet he seemed in more of rush so I asked him what happens if I find something else while using it . He said to contact Amazon . So I move it around thinking there is too much glare . Low and behold the entire front screen is punctured in making the screen look like there is perpetual glare . I call Amazon immediately within 5 minutes of the guy leaving telling them what happened . The guy on the phone reassured me that I did the right thing . Two days later I get a letter from Amazon that I cannot return the item , that the delivery service is not required to check to see if the item is working and that I signed for it . Believe me , I complained and now am able to return it . The moral of the story is to SERIOUSLY MAKE the delivery guy stand there whether it takes 5 minutes or an hour while you check every inch of your television or any large expensive item for that matter . Don't let them bully you into hurrying either . I 'm contemplating getting another one but am weary on the delivery service .  
1	  I had a problem with the connection to my plasma TV . The picture was flickering . I thought it was the TV until I replaced this cable with a " free " HDMI cable that came with my son 's game console . The flickering went away . Fortunately , Amazon was kind enough to refund my purchase price .  
2	  I found that these speakers proved to be easy to install in my door pannels of my 94'Camry and sounded better than the factory speakers . I reccomend them for their quality , price , and ease of installation .  
2	  This was a birthday present for my 16 year old and he said it works better than he thought . The price was unbeatable and unbelievable . Thank you for a great product !  
2	  great size for any family roast or meal . GREAT PRICE . user friendly and quality construction . I would purchase another one for big events if needed .  
1	  I bought this headset to use primarily for home schooling children for interactive educational software . The quality seems very good and they are packed with features . When they work , the sound is excellent , and the microphone works well too ( when it works . ) Unfortunately , it is 9 months now since a preliminary , very buggy driver was released for Windows Vista , and still no update . Windows tries to run the software for this as " legacy " software , but does not do well . I think I would give this a five star for how well it is made , but it only works about 20 % of the time in Windows Vista , so I give it a two . Tritton obviously does not care about selling this to Vista users , or many of us wouldn't be having these problems . What a disappointment . Maybe in a year or two they 'll have a working Vista driver , but by then we 'll probably have another version of Windows . Shame on you Tritton for not keeping your drivers updated on such a narrow range of products you sell .  
1	  Had to buy this for my aftermarket stereo in my bug . My reception is worse now .. Not sure if it 's the adapter or what .  
2	  While I am truly loathe to give a Microsoft product this high of a rating , I gotta call ' em like I sees ' em , and this is a really nice keyboard . When I first saw it , I snorted and made some derisive remark , but the more I thought about it in the weeks following , the more I secretly lusted after it . Finally , I broke down and purchased it , much to my own embarrassment . Thankfully , I haven't had any regrets since I did . Once I finally remembered to use the side panel regularly , I got a bit addicted to its convenience ; the scrolling wheel is really , really nice , as are the cut , copy and paste buttons . I don't tend to use the application tabber very often , because I 'm too attuned to Alt-Tab , but every now and then it 's handy , too . I rarely use the back and forward keys , largely because I forget about them , but sometimes I find them useful , too . It 's a relatively quiet keyboard , which is very nice , and it has good tactile feedback - perhaps a bit on the soft side , but I can type almost as fast on this board as on an ergo board . It feels like a quality keyboard , and not a cheap one . The built-in wrist rest is a notable feature , though I 'm not entirely convinced that I like it - it makes the board a * lot * larger , and prevents the use of another wrist rest , such as a gel pad ( which I prefer . ) Also , it doesn't come up high enough to be of use during actual typing , but when my hands come to a rest , it keeps my wrists from unnaturally flexing . I like the larger delete key in the grouping just to the right of the main keys - it 's easier to find quickly , and I seldom used the " insert " key that it displaced . The cord is of adequate length to put on one 's lap , which is very nice . It 's too bad they don't use the same length for their mousing products , alas . I have a couple of gripes about this device , though ; first and foremost , it 's not an " ergo " split keyboard , which is by far my preference . The standard , non-split keyboard design just forces my wrists into a slightly unnatural angle , and wears on me a bit . Also , the F-lock is automatically disabled upon reboot , which means that all of the function keys revert to their " new and improved " options , such as " task pane , " " new , " " open , " " close , " et cetera . It seems to me that MS got this backwards , and that the default should be the standard key functions . Further , I 'm sure many people find oodles of use from the new and improved functions of these keys , but personally , I 've used them less than a dozen times in the five or so months I 've had the product ; I find it much more efficient to hit the keyboard shortcut than to take one hand and reach up to the function key row . Likewise , I seldom use any of the top row keys at all , apart from the volume controls ; I have little use for Office at home , but I 'm sure those folks at work would use these more often . One helpful bit about the top row keys is that nearly all of them are able to be programmed to bring up whatever you 'd like them to bring up . Since this is an MS product , I fully expected the " Web / Home " key to be stuck with Internet Explorer , the " Mail " key to bring up Outlook , and so forth . It almost , * almost * , gives me hope . I really have to hand it to Microsoft 's hardware department ; they seem to have their stuff together . It 's truly unfortunate that they have to make themselves , y'know , 99 % evil through their software and marketing divisions . So , to sum up a perhaps overly-long review , GREAT KEYBOARD .  
1	  My book 's firewire port was recognized by a cardbus adapter ( I-O gear ) , but a firewire express card ( Startech-2 port ) did not recognize the drive . Any suggestions ?  
1	  I got this play and charge kit but in the end I regret it . While the battery was good and would hold a charge , thwe wire would make a buzzing noise everytime i plugged it in . Never will buy from this seller again  
1	  Q : When is a scanner not a scanner ? A : When its a toy . This is one of the worst products I have ever used . Its almost impossible to scan any amount of stacked paper without multiple jams and multiple sheets being pulled at once . If the stack has ever been stapled together or even punch with a hole punch , the few fibers that link the sheets are enough to stick multiple sheets together . The roller system is terrible . This product is virtually unusable for people intending to scan more than one sheet at a time . Suggest you avoid it and go with a more robust products with a better pulling system , such as one of the Brother multifunction copiers .  
2	  Got this one when a power surge seemingly fried the old one , an AT & T 1720 that I got in ' 97 . The old one had cost $ 80 , this one only $ 30 . And they 've fixed the problems that they used to have . For example , the old one required batteries for backup , and the batteries tended to leak after awhile . This one doesn't require them . Sound quality is also better , and it 's smaller . Works great with our AT & T 9301 cordless phone . After 10 months of use , I have no complaints .  
1	  I have a 5G 60gb black video ipod , this product was soo small and did NOT fit the dimensions of my ipod as is advertised . The individual pieces slide on fine , but when you try to snap them closed , it is too tight and does not snap , thus does not work . Also it should be note , the plastic is very cheap , while it is thick .. it is also not very durable and can easily crack . TOTALLY NOT WORTH $ 30 . Look for a different brand in ipod cases , there are others out there that I have had much success with in the past .  
2	  The Problem with all protable devices is that the sound quality is Just never that good . But with the Brain Shaker you can actually feel the music , I must say it is quite a feeling , it sends vibrations into the body and in some cases it has given me the chills a few times because the feeling is that good . I give these a five star because they are truley worth it .  
2	  Working well for me with wired keyboard and wireless mouse , I 'm not using audio . Video looks good - i don't think i can see a difference with the KVM installed . The keyboard and mouse have to be plugged into the KVM correctly , according to the written instructions and the symbols on the KVM itself . I rushed through that step ( thinking USB is Universal ) and got them backwards , and the KVM wouldn't switch . IOGEAR phone support helped in minutes . He didn't ask me if i had RTFM , as he was well within his rights to do , and was helpful . He might get a lot of this question every day . The video switch takes about 3 seconds to one computer , and 4 seconds to the other . I think this is the computer speed and how quickly it detects that there is a new screen attached . It would be nice if the KVM switch could keep the the unused side " warm " so that the switch-over would be faster . This would probably require support in the computer itself ( each computer ) . Amazon 's price and shipping were excellent . A + Would buy again .  
1	  I work in IT and after using this router and also getting it replaced with another we ran into constant problems where the WiFi would drop and the only way to reset it was to power cycle the unit . I tried multiple different things such as using only N or G signal , disabling QoS and even leaving the encryption off with no luck . Ended up going with a little more expensive Netgear router and it has been running perfect .  
2	  I was looking for an inexpensive pair of headphones to use with my MP3 player and cell phone ( which doubles as an MP3 player ) . These earphones were an excellent price , so I purchased them . The silicone ear-cup is soft and flexible and remains comfortable even after extended wear . They fit nicely into the ear and stay put even during vigorous movement like running . The sound quality is fair - bass is very heavy and music is sometimes fuzzy or muddy , but for the price , I believe the quality is more than adequate . After several months of wear , the right ear cup has suffered a small tear , but is still functional and I haven't noticed a decline in its ability to stay in my ear . I highly recommend these !  
2	  After a whole lot of frustration and searching for an adapter between my Macbook Air and my Infocus 70 + , I finally found the solution . The Apple store doesn't have anything like this , but to their credit they did give me the correct search term . This hooks up easily , works correctly , and is a great deal for twice the price . Feel free to post questions if you have any .  
2	  To be honest , there isn't too much special about these CDs aside from the fact that they look like mini-vinyl records .. but they work great and don't cost much at all !  
2	  Used the microphone just once so far - but the quality was excellent ! Loved the price too . I think it 's a good buy .  
1	  I bought this camera for the high picture quality , the video options , and 5x zoom . Although the camera performed OK for general picture-taking , I had 2 major issues : 1 . The video quality was not good . Of course , I did not expect the same quality as a dedicated video camera , but I have seen several examples from friends with similar cameras . The video on this camera was very choppy , not matter what mode I used . I used a high-speed SDHC 4MB card , with the same results . 2 . We often use this camera to take pictures of our 3-year old grandson . He rarely holds a pose for more than an instant , so I need the camera to take the picture when I press the shutter release . This camera takes well over 1 second between shutter release and actually snapping the picture . Most of the pictures of our grandson only show the back of his head ! Some other issues with this camera : a . You cannot plug the camera into the USB port and access the pictures unless you download Kodak 's clunky software . Other cameras I have used are recognized by my computer as a new removable drive , making picture transfer a drag and drop operation . b . The automatic lens cover stuck open on several occasions . I had to use my fingernail to push it shut . We had to return the camera for these reasons . I am  
2	  I guess a cable either works or it does not work . The one I got works well .  
2	  I moved my home audio to a different area of the room than where my TV is . I had to purchase an extender for the IR receiver and with this product I was set . I will say that the sticky tape that came with this is pretty cheap so I used some 3M product I got at Walmart to hold both the IR receiver to the TV and the component itself to the inside of my cabinet . Easy to install and easy to use .  
2	  The Kensington 64321 Wireless Studio Mouse is the easiest thing I 've installed on my Mac . Of course nothing is hard on a Mac . So this says it all . It does all it 's designed for . I am enjoying every time I use it . Just smooth .  
2	  I bought this frame for my mother-in-law to have with her so we could push photos of my daughter to her . This is done over the wi-fi , as kodak lets the frame pull photos from an online gallery that we can upload pictures to . Note however that I have seen this frame freeze up ( just while being on and doing its thing ) , and thus needing a power off power on cycle ( no need to unplug , as there is a switch ) . For the price , feature packed !  
2	  I used this cable to hook up my Wii to my projector in my home theater room . It worked like a charm . Delivery was fast , efficient and everything was delivered as promised . I would definitely buy from this vendor again .  
2	  I bought this camera as a tentative substitute for my canon s40 . The price was just irresistible and I didn't have a high expectation for this . But , hey , this is a powerful digit cam ! 1 . Overall , the photo is sharp and of good quality . The flash light is powerful , so expect to have some shadows in the background when you take the pic inside . Perhaps a little bit too sharp for my taste ( Canon s40 produces much softer pictures , though sometimes blurred ) , so I tend to change to manual mode for a more smooth lighting . The super macro mode is a pleasant surprise , and the scene mode works pretty well as well . 2 . You can use this to take video for as long as 1 GB memory ! 3 . It is not a real pocket size digit cam . But it is light and is only slightly noticeable in your kakhi pocket . Not in your jeans though . I have been able to carry this in my pocket during my evening walk and it works perfectly . Overall , for a Canon digit cam with a price like this , surely a good bargain !  
1	  I just got into photography as a major hobby and got a new fuji camera that uses this memory card . I recently went to buy one of those memory card computor adaptors and the bloke from the counter told me there weren't any standard kind for this memory card ! This was a major disadvantage for me in my class and can be a disadvantage if you bought ( or received for x-mas ) a [ bad ] fugi camera . So now I just have to use the regular lousy way of hooking the camera up to the computor and waisting my batteries . ( and it takes a day to recharge those things ) That is the worst thing about this memory card . It 's expensive ( though I take all cards are ) too and it holds well , unless you make a film with it .  
2	  The card came carefully packed and in perfect condition . It also arrived prior to the date they promised .  
1	  It 's hard to find a small compact disk for my embroidery machine . I appreciate it very much . Thank you so much ..  
2	  feel , but once you use it for a week , you will never go back to a standard keyboard . Very well done Microsoft !  
1	  I didn't buy from Amazon . com , which wouldn't be better , because the D-Link customer department is a Joke . The DPR-1260 didn't work properly for months , I tried to reach the technical support , but they were unable to solve the problem , and return or change the item . I will never buy anything from D-Link . DON'T BUY IT !  
1	  This camera took great pictures for a P & S ; , and the compact size was great for portability . Unfortunately I experienced the same " lens error " as many others . Normally one would simply send it back to the manufacturer and they would cover the cost of defect , but Canon has not decided to do so - meaning you 'll spend more than the camera is worth to get it fixed . The lens error is a well-known and well-documented problem with these cameras and a number of other Canons that use the same lens . Being a geek , I took it apart and found that two gears were binding together and made one break off its rotating shaft . Unfortunately no fix , and simply a symptom of its own design - though I imagine getting any sort of dirt or sand in the area would immediately make it bind and snap as well , so be careful of that when considering this camera . Overall , great picture quality for a point-and-shoot with fantastic color where other cameras struggle ( for example , a sunset ) . The Achilles heel of this gadget is the " lens error " .  
2	  I could not find this TV locally for a good price . I paid over a $ 1000 less on Amazon compared to what Best Buy - Magnolia Room is charging for the same HDTV . This is my second Panasonic plasma HDTV ( my other is a 42 " ) . The styling is much better than previous models . I have not had the television professionally calibrated yet , but the picture and sound is outstanding . I highly recommend this HDTV over the even more expensive Pioeneer Elite . The picture quality is crisp and clean , while the video processor seems to have little to no lag time .  
1	  There is no such chip as an AMD Athlon 64 Processor FX 70 125 WATT AM2 . It is a socket F with 1207 pins , not 940 socket AM2 as the ad banner describes . Don't be mislead into believing this is the next chip in the FX Athlon series after the incredible FX 62 . It was an interim chip produced before the Quad core chips came out . The only motherboard I can find for it comes from Asus ( Even they don't guarantee compatability since the board was designed for an Opteron . ) To realize a performance increase over the Athon 6400 + , you will need two CPU 's , otherwise even the Athon 6000 out performs just a single chip . I do not believe any other board manufacturers are planning boards for this chip . There are ads all over the internet for the AMD Athlon 64 Processor FX 70 125 WATT AM2 , but none of them clearly indicate that this chip is a socket F. I believe there is a lot of inventory out there and this misleading banner is just an attempt to unload an expensive orphaned chip .  
1	  I bought the Denon S-101 2.1 home theater system to get rid of all the wires my wife didn't like ! I thought the system sounded better than the Bose 3-2-1 system and I got a good deal from Best Buy when I bought my 50 " panasonic plasama tv . The S-101 had decent sound , not great , but good . The sub woofer had adjustments but was not earth shaking ! After using the system for 13 months the dvd player failed to recognize the dvd 's and cd 's I was trying to play . I called customer service and they told me to send it to a shop in VA for repairs , and of course the warranty was up and I would have to pay for the shipping and repairs . I was told it could cost as much as to $ 400.00 to repair . Hell , I could buy a new system for less than that ! I would definitly never buy another Denon home theater system again , or any system with the dvd player integrated in with the speaker system . If the dvd player fails , your screwed !  
2	  This is one nice USB cable . It is very well constructed and does not have a " cheap " look . Compares to cables that are priced much higher . This is a great deal , especially for under 5 bucks !  
1	  I have purchased 4 of these units trying to find one that worked . If it worked it would be a great addition to my case . I had it plugged into 4 Antec TriCool 120MM fans set to high - 0.24A with a 2.88W power consumption . Well within the spec of this controller . Unit 1 - Failed after 3 hours . Fan # 4 went below 600RPM then eventually stopped all together no matter how much I cranked it up . Plugged the fan in directly to the mobo , works fine , tried another fan in the controller , still below 600 RPM . Unit 2 - Failed immediately - Fan # 2 would not turn on at all , ( checked the fan , it works fine ) Fan # 4 would not go above 600 RPM ( it 's a 2000 RPM fan ) . Unit 3 - Failed after 1 day of running . Fan # 4 again . Unit 4 - Failed after 6 hours - Fan # 4 . There must be a problem with the way that Thermaltake has wired the controller , in series with some cheap components that constantly fail maybe ? Maybe I had 4 products all from a bad batch . Maybe it 's a piece of garbage . If you have better luck I would like to know .  
2	  Don't get scared when you look at the price of this product . It is $ 200 but it is well worth your money . With TiVo , you are able to rewind , pause or stop live television . How cool is that ? You are also able to record any tv show that you want and what is even cooler is that you can enable it to that TiVo records every single episode for the certain Tv show that you want it to record . Now thats even cooler ! TiVo couldn't be easier to work your way around , there is of course a tv guide installed into it so you don't need to look up times for shows in a magazine / newspaper tv guide anymore . And with this certain TiVo package , you can record up to 80 hours of tv shows . Now thats a lot ! Go TiVo ! PROS : 1 . Pause / rewind / stop live televion . 2 . Record any tv show you want or enable it to record every episode for that certain show for you . 3 . Can store 80 hours of recorded televion . 4 . Installed TV Guide . Cons : Remote to TiVo isn't isn't fully responsive . Get TiVo now !  
2	  After my creative 5.1 surround sound PC speakers finally gave up the ghost ( after 8 years ) , I was shocked at just how much a QUALITY 5.1 speaker set up was going to cost ! THEN I stumbled across reviews for two alternatives : the Logitech z623 and the Klipsch pro media . First I thought that these being 2.1 not 5.1 surround sound would be a negative ; boy was I wrong ! The quality of 2.1 peakers has obviously dramtically improved since I last checked ! I also had the fortune of comparing BOTH 200 watt ( yes , you read right ) systems side by side at my local Best Buy store . Both gave an excellent sound quality , were VERY loud and not only beat out every 5.1 pc speaker system I heard , but also beat the pants off two sets of BOSE speakers right next to them ! Although they both sounded exceptionally high quality systems , something about the tonal reproduction of the Klipsch sold me on them . Loud ? Oh definately ! Virtually distortion free at high volume and as faithful a reproduction of the original sound as you can get ! I play jazz sax at private gigs and I use backing tracks on a notebook with these speakers hooked upto the notebook ; it 's as good as having a REAL LIVE backing band with me ! On the negative side , two issues : FIRST the quality of the satellite speaker wire connection to the subwoofer ; VERY poor ; just thin , twin speaker wire , color coded with about an inch of exposed wire at the end of each cable to insert into a spring loaded wire clip on the sub ; VERY poor quality and I can see problems in the future . SECOND no power switch on the speakers at all ! You have to reach down and unpug the woofer from the power strip / surge suppressor to shut them off ! Apart from these two negatives , while pricey for 2.1 speakers ( though not as pricey as BOSE ) , if you prize the quality of the reproduced sound on your computer , whether it be musical or the roar of jet engines from your flight simulator , these are a must have ! And as I said , IMHO better than BOSE at a substantially lower price !  
1	  I bought this unit from QVC about six months ago . I have really never been able to set this up . I have a tv with all the connections but have no idea how to set this up . I have tried many different ways & when I do either one part of the setup works or none of it works . When I put it to DVD Live / TV the picture is all snowy . Anybody have any ideas on how to give me easy directions on what the correct way to set this up is . I also bought Monster cables for the Component setup & that doesn't seem to work either . When QVC had this on they said it was an easy setup . I will never buy another Cyberhome product again . JUNK , JUNK , JUNK !  
2	  I unpacted the parcell and quickly read the instructions . The software provided worked well on Vista . It provided a complete backup with no problems but the backup was slow . I do not believe that the backup time was any slower than other backup units but there are some untis that are easier to use ( the one click which I do not own ) and some of the other backup units I considered buying . The reason I purchased this unit was price . For the price I feel it was a good investment . Jim  
1	  This is my second Zen Plus . The first one I used for over a year and still works . I bought a second with more memory but the backlight burned out within 3 weeks and it is nearly unusable .  
1	  Dont be cheap like i was , spend the extra 100-200 bucks and get a better system . This worked good for 3 months and then the sound just got worse and worse .. im going for the oknoyo system .. wish me luck !  
1	  At first glance , this product appears to be a good effort . It has a sleek , strong , attractive casing . It also comes with software to periodically back-up your system . However , the software simply doesn't function properly , at least not with my Windows XP operating system . Certain instructional boxes in the software wouldn't appear in their full form , making it impossible to perform certain functions , such as eject the system . Also , if you use the software to back up , it compresses the files , making it impossible to see what files have actually been backed up on the external hard drive . They just show as numbered files , rather than the original file names . Also , installation was a huge hassle - not a typical " plug and play " device . When it installed it in my USB drive , it would temporarily lock up the system , then perform some sort of file scan , before it would finally install about 60 seconds later . I replaced it with a Western Digital My Book external hard drive that works much better . Simply plug in the Western Digital product in the USB port , and it is recognized and functioning quickly .  
1	  The reason this got a one is because you could get the Palm IIxe for the same price . I first got a visor delux and from the start I realized problems , first you can not upgrade the system ( but you can with the Palm IIxe ) . Secondly , the blocky shape can get annoying ( where as the Palm IIxe has a nice smooth and rounded shape ) . The modules are such a pain , I mean we paid enough for the unit , now we need modules ? The Visor dulex is a great unit , there 's no doubt about that , but why get that when you could have the much better Palm IIxe , or the TRGpro . This is just a warning , this is not worth the money , get the Palm IIxe , you 'll be sorry if you don't . By the way , Palm makes much better add ons for thier products , and service just isn't quite the same with handspring . I switched to the Palm IIxe for the reasons above , I don't think I need any other explaination .  
2	  This is the most satisfying product I have ever purchased i think , there is not one flaw and i cannot even try to create a reason which I am disappointed , the best I can do is that I wish the headphone jack was one the other side . I have searched around endlessly and after constant disappointement with electronic store selection , I decided the just buy these , even though I never tried them , based on the recommendations , no regrets . Sound quality : ExcellentAmbient Noise cancelling : Very ExcellentProximate Noise cancelling : Very GoodComfort : Excellent ( no discomfort after 4-hour plane trip ) If you have the money , you have probably already bought the bose , but if you want the most for your money , no doubt this is where it 's at , you will not be disappointed .  
2	  Battery was a replacement for a 5yr old camera . Brought needed new life into the camera . Got here very quickly .  
2	  Love this item ! Works perfectly and really helps clean out noise in the lines . I recommend this PowerCenter !  
1	  I got this product because it seemed that the industry was moving away from CD 's and toward these MP3 / ipod / WMA players , and I didn't want to wake up one morning and find that all my painstakingly collected music was unplayable . But was I ever in for a shock ! This product is nowhere NEAR ready for prime time , and is unacceptable on almost every conceivable level . Without going into detail on any of my complaints about the device itself ( it doesn't even have an on-off switch , let alone an equalizer ) , the most infuriating problem is the software . You can't just load tracks from your computer and be done with it - not by a long shot . You have to KEEP those tracks where the device found them the first time they were " synced , " otherwise every one of those tracks will be deleted from the device the next time the device is connected to your computer - and you have no option about this ! Many people have posted online complaints about this bug , and Microsoft has apparently sent out a squad of cybergoons to defend the indefensible , calling users " stupid " if they want to delete those tracks from their hard drives . ( Or if they happen to accidentally erase the tracks . Or if they want to connect the Zune device to a different computer that doesn't have those tracks . Or if they want to keep the same tracks in a different folder and / or in a different format Or if they want to offload the files to a DVD or other storage device . All those are really stupid ideas , aren't they ? ) That " feature " alone makes the Zune system unacceptable , but that 's just the tip of the iceberg . While trying to " sync " tracks from my hard drive to the Zune device , many of the tracks were rejected . And , in keeping with the total incompetence of the Zune software , there was no error message generated at the time telling me that the attempt to load the tracks had failed . I only found out about it when I went to a screen that listed the tracks that had been loaded , and found that many were missing . So then I went to still a THIRD screen ( The Zune software is nearly impossible to navigate , BTW ) and found a list of tracks that had been " skipped " in my attempt to load them . I right-clicked on one of the tracks and discovered that there was an error code associated with the problem . However the software had no idea what the error code meant and directed me to the " Zune Help " website . What was the website 's solution ? " Unfortunately , there is no specific Web Help message for this error yet . " It then directed me to a forum to see whether anyone there had a suggestion . This forum was a real eye-opener . I posted my problem on the forum only two days ago , and since that time there have been SEVEN PAGES of new postings , every one of them complaining of some new Zune software problem . Furthermore , the forum apparently has space enough for only seven pages of postings - which means only two days ' worth - and anything beyond that just rolls off into outer space . And since Microsoft itself has no solution to offer , this device for which I paid $ 200 is essentially useless . I should add that there is no user 's manual , and that the Zune software has no help function or help file . There is a website that calls itself a Zune user 's manual , but it is as difficult to navigate as the Zune software itself - and that 's saying something . It has no systematic explanation of how to accomplish even the most basic tasks , and makes constant references to menus and links that don't exist on the current version of the software . Stay away ! This product is as unprofessional and unacceptable as any product could possibly be .  
1	  I believe this product was defective as it ran out in less than a month . Other inks purchase and installed at the same time are still registering as nearly full . All previous carts last at least 3 months . My usage style has not changed . I had to buy a new cart elsewhere . Not pleased !  
2	  This is the perfect item for an outdoors person . Whether you 're geocaching ( primary purpose for me ) , hiking , or marking treestands , this device is the one . Not complicated and easy to send / receive data from a computer .  
1	  I bought this cable together with a 750GB harddrive for expanding my DirecTV 's HD DVR . According to forum search on internet , the HD DVR will accept external HHD connected via ESATA cable , and only works with ESATA cable . I bought the two said items both from Amazon ( Amazon , LLC ) . Amazon advertised this as ESATA cable . In reality , when the item arrived , both the flex-film package as well as the markings on the cable says SATA ; nothing on the package / product was labelled ESATA . Sure enough , when connected , the DVR did not recognize the external HDD . I then bought a ESATA cable from local BestBuy just to prove / dis-prove this - and sure enough , with the ESATA calbe from local store , the DVR recognizes the external HDD . Bottomline : This item is advertised by Amazon as ESATA , but it is not ESATA . I 'm gonna try and return this item . If Amazon reimburse in full , including shipping , I 'll change my rating to neutral . But as of now , I feel cheated ( and have evidence to prove I got cheated ) by Amazon .  
2	  Why sell a white TV with a black power cable ! ? ! Ugh . Also , takes a really long time to turn on and the remote is weird and large ( I replaced with a universal ) . Good picture , size and style , bad attention to details .  
1	  I know , this is a cheaper camera . We 're all trying to save these days . Still .. this one is really bad . The design : cheapy . Sorry , I couldn't come up with another word for it . When my daughter went up to adjust it on the laptop , the base broke like it was made of sugar . The video quality is really poor - both pixelized and choppy . So you basically can't use it other than as a talking head , and even then , IF you 're not moving your head , your mouth , or breathing , then you * may * get a recognizable image .. For this price range , it 's not the worse , but frankly , it 's not doing very much for you . For $ 39.99 , you can get an IPEVO POV webcam , that 'll have much higher resolution , better frames per seconds ( 30fps , standard on all chat services ) , solid design so you aren't afraid it 'll fall apart within 1 week , and you can hand it off to your kids to show grandma the dog without fearing for your $ 30 .. Overall , very disappointing , even for that price .  
1	  The picture indicates a DVI-I Dual Link connector . CE Compass sent a DVI-D Dual Link connector . Don't waste your time with these clowns , unless you like your orders to be crapshoots .. Not knowing what you 're gonna get .  
1	  I found the Toshiba sd-2109 to be the best machine for the money . The sound and picture are great and up there with the best of them-at half the cost . I 've had my unit for four months and I 'm very satisfied .  
2	  I have severe arthritis in both hands and this keyboard is arthritis friendly . The keys are so easy to use . And I love that it lights up because my keyboard sits on a roller shelf that goes under the desk and it makes it hard to see the keys . The design is great and I will never use another brand keyboard again .  
2	  Have no complaints so far . Worked every time . At one time , I thought the Ipod was not working but it was only the charger plug . So this saved me about $ 150.00  
2	  It is safe to say that any product you buy from Sony is a high-quality product , at least in my opinion , and in the case of the Sony DCR-TRV140 Camcorder , it is no exception . The quality of the video is excellent ; the " Nightshot " view is useful , however , I don't see any use for it for me . It should be noted that while the Sony DCR-TRV140 does have IEE1394 FireWire support ( using a 4-pin port on the camera ) it does not include the cable necessary for you to connect your camera to the computer through the IEE1394 protocol . This cable can be purchased separately for around $ 40 at Sony , or other retailers . The USB Streaming is excellent , and the software included with the Camcorder is very comprehensive and easy to use ; however , I like using Windows Movie Maker 2 to import and edit my movies . At any rate , to edit the movies , all you have to do is connect the USB cable to the camera and to your USB port on your computer then record the digital video . If there is at least one thing I would change about this camera , it would be the support and user-guides for the camera . There is a user manual , which does provide basic information , but I found for my needs-which is that of the average user-it is not comprehensive enough . Despite that downfall , I certainly would recommend this fairly low-cost camera to anyone interested in entering the digital video sector of the digital world .  
1	  The sound is fine , but I broke it before I could even get it on the wall . The stands are made of a plastic that broke under minimal pressure when I was trying to adjust the angle . I 'd recommend a different model .  
1	  Bought twoTwo went bad within a yearFirst one had trouble copy & paste ( would erratically pick up only partial click and drag ) Second oneAfter 40 seconds of operation , it cuts out for a minute , ( NO ! It 's not a problem with Fz lock ) . I feel both problems are related in that the actual design of the inner mouse mechanism is extremely vulnerable to shockI just work with these mice in an office environment - Don't remember dropping them - If I did , it would only hit the carpetFor example : On mouse one - depending on " how " you pushed to " click " would create a varying degree of results when it came to cut and pasteBasically both these expensive mice are useless and disco from my computersI honestly would not buy another one of these guys products ! Too much of a coincidence ; and , the nature of the problems lead me to believe it is either a design flaw or QA problems over in China ( or where ever they make these things )  
2	  Not top of the line , but in the birding world top of the line starts at around $ 1,500 U.S. However , if you are looking for well constructed glasses that you can take anywhere into the field I would get these . Great especially for beginning birders and wildlife observers on a tight budget . I also have a pair of Leupold WindRiver Pinnacles , and another pair of Leupold Olympics and although they cost more , especially the Pinnacles , they are not quite as sharp as the Ranger SRTs . Construction-wise the SRT is made like a tank , and you won't worry about dings and dust . I actually bought a pair of SRT 's for my son to use in his college field work , and regrettably did a simple focus and sharpness comparison ( the business card taped to a distant wall test ) to my Leupold 's . Fortunately , I got the Leupold 's at an aggressive sale price so it didn't hurt as much , but if you paid list , you could spend twice as much and not get as good as the SRT .  
2	  save yourself a couple dollars , those sold by eek Technology were great ! used Canon for years , what a waste of Money !  
2	  This lens is awesome , best for taking close up picture of wild life and you must use tripod during daylight .  
1	  I purchased this H10 20Gb at full price . It stopped working within 30 days and IRiver refused to honor their warranty . They gave me the runaround for an entire year until the warranty ran out . Now it 's a $ 300 piece of junk . THIS PRODUCT AND IT 'S MANUFACTURER ARE NOT RELIABLE .  
1	  I loved my Palm m505 but it started failing to hot sync after less than a year . The Tech Support people were very polite and responsive but none of their suggestions helped . My husband 's m515 failed to hot sync after only 6 months . ( We use different desktops so it 's not a problem with one individual computer . ) For us , [ $ ] or so is a lot of money to pay for an electronic device that works for less than a year . I will never buy another Palm product . Which is too bad , because I love the way their products work , when they work .  
1	  This gets less than one star from me . I now know the difference between a good HDMI cable and a cheap useless one . After attaching the HDMI to my BluRay player , I started getting delays and gaps in the video . I thought it may have been the disc but I switched with my cable box and then the cable picture experienced the same delays and gaps . I dumped the cheap HDMI and purchased a flat HDMI higher quality cable from a big box store in Vegas and both the picture and audio work great now . Price does make a difference with HDMI and electronics . I will rely on the gold HDMI cable from now on . I did not think there was much difference in HDMI cables , but I found out there are huge differences in the quality that effects all electronic devices .  
2	  Excellent Flash Card with more than enough memory . Can there be too much memory ? Great card !  
2	  I used this camera on the beach quite a bit last month , and it performed just as I hoped it would . I swam with it a few times , and it survived the submersion with flying colors , even floating to the top a few times when it slipped out of my pocket . I wasn't diving or anything , but for submersion within 10 feet of the surface , it did fine . Can't speak to deeper use . I didn't use the camera to take underwater pics , but it did fine with pictures above water when wet . The resolution is obviously a far cry from what you can get with even the cheapest digital camera now , so you should go in aware that these aren't museum-quality prints or anything . But for what it is , this camera does fine . I also highly recommend buying the camera from Amazon . They 're not paying me to say this or anything , but I looked at local drugstores , and the exact same camera was literally 2.5-3 times as expensive . I can't for the life of me figure out why the mark-up is so high , but that 's what it is in the Washington , DC , area .  
1	  If you want to know how good this POS from CaNOT is , just do a google on Canon ZR-300 " remove the cassette " . This message will appear after very light use and the tape will constantly eject . Lots of other people have had the same issue . Have missed 2 very important occasions because of this problem . My last digital camera which was also a Canon stunk too , I will never again support the Canon team as they try to pedal worthless overengineered under QC 'd pieces of junk to the American market . They also have a proprietary software system in their copiers that you have to pay 5k and be a dealer to do anything with . Here 's hoping Canon 's sales drop and they go bankrupt .  
2	  I finally got this headset from my office and it has been great . I am on the phone all day and I haven't had to recharge it yet . The sound is good enough for me to talk with my clients without any worries .  
2	  My wife asked me for an MP3 player or a portable music player . After looking around , I decided to buy the 4GB Ipod Mini ( silver ) . It will have plenty of disk space for over 1000 songs which is enough at a time for my wife , plus it is very light weight and includes a belt clip . The software , iTunes loaded and connected to our new ipod with the supplied firewire cable ( also includes a USB cable ) with our WinXP machine . The unit comes with a charger , but we it can also charge when connected to the computer ( save the charger for trips away from the computer ) . I ripped a few of our CDs into the iTunes software ( AAC format , 128 bit rate but you can use MP3 if you wish ) , and the quality is excellent , so now only about 200 more CDs to go but they rip pretty quickly and you can listen to the tracks while you are importing . The software easily syncs the tunes into the iPod . Many say that the iPod is about design and colors , which personally don't matter to me , but the iPod mini is also about function . The way you scroll through menus , adjust volume , etc . is soo slick and easy once you spend a few minutes with this machine . I love it so much , I have now convinced myself to also buy the 20GB machine for myself to hold all of our music .  
1	  Tonight I got my new NEC SuperScript 1400 Printer . However , after connecting it to a new computer , and using the CD to install a driver , the printer just prints a black band along the left margin of the paper ( and no text ) . Why ? After three hours waiting and talking with tech support at NEC , my computer manufacturer , and again at NEC , I learned that NEC does not have a driver to make the printer work with Microsoft Windows Millennium . NEC and Amazon . com should disclose that NEC SS 1400 PRINTER WILL NOT OPERATE WITH COMPUTERS THAT USE THE WINDOWS MILLENNIUM OPERATING SYSTEM . It would save everyone time . Now , I have to ship the printer back to Amazon . Amazon and NEC should also mention that neither Office Depot nor Staples carries the toner cartridges .  
1	  This is the cutest camera , but that is about it . The pictures are not very clear-lots of pixels . You can't take pictures in moderate light . You must not twitch or the picture will blur . The focus is off . The lens isn't dead center , so you have to adjust your position for a centered picture . The print out is low quality . But again , it is cute and very James Bond looking . It also works like a jump drive and you can transport files ( word docs , pictures , etc . ) . I would have preferred to pay about half of what I did , but it will make a fun gadget on Christmas day and to keep in the car as the just in case camera .  
2	  It meets my needs for a scanner and copier . Copies are clear with good color . The only drawback is it doesn't have a handset to enable it to double as a phone , but it does have caller ID . For an inexpensive all-in-one , it serves my purpose just fine .  
2	  I bought this enclosure so I could use it with my HD that was recently removed from my iMac . Using the Firewire cable , I have been able to access my old data , including the ability to transfer my data to the new OS installation . ( This cable is included , which is worth an extra STAR , in my opinion . I do have a Firewire cable , but I don't remember this being in the item description and I find that to be a definite bonus . ) Definitely a top-notch product . Easy to use and it looks nice sitting on my desktop . As an IT consultant , I have owned 15-20 different HD enclosures , and would rate this one as the best . Both in terms of features and style . I wouldn't have any problems leaving this with any of my clients , even the ones that are very particular about the quality of items they are purchasing from me . Highly recommended !  
1	  This camera seemed to have everything we needed and for the first few months worked well . After using it for a month or two , the battery case stopped closing completely and the camera would not register that the batteries were charged ( even with brand new batteries ) . Canon repaired it twice but it still does not work .  
2	  About once a week it locks up & I have to Re-Download the settins fron the web . Some of the buttons are too close together & you hit two at once .. causing lockups . Other than that it is ' as advertised ' .  
2	  I bought this DS-2300 to replace my DS-330 . The 330 had internal memory and I had to download every night after my 3-hour lecture . The 2300 has external memory so that I can separate items ( personal , school , work , etc ) and it stores much more than the limited amount of memory on the 330 . It has a nice size that is thin and fits into your pocket . The memory life also seems to be pretty good on this . As I had read on other reviews , the placement of the buttons might be a tad tricky , but so far no problems . My one complaint is that this recorder did * not * come with a case / pouch like the 330 . I went to the Olympus site and they offer one to European customers , but not U.S.Other than this drawback and the price , I am pleased on upgrading to the 2300 .  
1	  I also recieved the wrong motherboard .. twice . Instead of fixing the problem and sending me the correct board ( as advertised ) they cancelled my order , gave me back my money and told me to go look someplace else for it . Not good sales practice  
2	  Some reviewers stated they had a problem with the briefcase staying open . I did not have that experience . I do believe the manufacturer would enhance the product if the foam padding were removed . The size suits me as it is the same size of another prior briefcase I had . I cannot speak to the carry strap as I have not and will not use it . There is still plenty of room in the middle section with the padding but I do not think it is needed and I do not intend to carry a laptop in the briefcase except occassionally . I like the combination lock as I carry sensitive material and sometimes need to leave the case in an office or witness room and the combination lock serves the purpose of keeping the contents from prying eyes without having to carry another key . This makes about the eighth briefcase I have carried and so far I like this one better than any of the rest and some of which were considerably more expensive . This is a good case without having to expend $ 500 .  
2	  This is a beautiful case and worth every penny . The ipod is a beautiful instrument deserving of a case of this premium quality . This case fits my 30 GB 5G ipod perfectly . I can see how it may be kind of tight for those who have the 60 GB ipod . I slip my ipod in and out of this case with no scratching issues whatsoever . While it is a little more difficult , I am now able to work the click wheel just fine through the clear plastic protector . I love the way this thing hooks on to your belt loop . The ipod will hang upside down but that is so you can grab it and easily use it while it is connected to your belt loop . The kickstand feature is fabulous . Some people complain that it will not stay up by itself . That is because they have not figured out that the small strap that holds the ipod in the case buttons into the top half of the case holding it in place as a kickstand . Works perfect . I find no functional drawbacks with this case . Being made of fine grain leather it has a luxury fell to it and it smells great . Highly Recommended .  
1	  I almost skipped this product due to the low price and what I assumed would be poor sound quality . Unfortunately I was fooled by the good reviews and place an order . The sound quality really is poor . I had the volume on up to full on my ipod and could barely hear the music over the background noise in the gym . What little I could hear was tinny and barely recognizable as music . This is not an anti-Sony rant - I have gone back to my tried and trusted ( but more expensive ) Sony MDR-AS20J . They are double the price but 10 times the quality .  
2	  Griffin iTrip Universal FM Transmitter and Charger for MP3 PlayersIt was just what I was looking for at such a low price . Works like a charm !  
1	  When I use this MP3 , I had many problems with it . Here are the problems : 1 . It freezes too much . ( Even on the first day I used it ) 2 . It has a slow response . 3 . When I reset the Zen , it decreases performance . 4 . It shakes to much . 5 . If accidentally dropped , makes the reader for the disk busted . 6 . It is a disk type MP3.7 . The processor is sluggish . These are the things that makes it bad . But there are actually some good feature that are very awesome . 1 . Big capacity . 2 . Good resolution screen . 3 . Microphone ( The cause of freezing ) 4 . Long battery life . 5 . Lots of featuresAs you can probably see , the cons outweigh the pros . This MP3 is a must-not buy .  
1	  To start , to turn it on , the instruction manual says to push the power button " for a few seconds " . I 've never had it come on in fewer than 15 seconds , and it often takes 30 or more . That 's 30 seconds of sitting there like an idiot holding your finger on the button , wondering if the thing is actually defective . Have you ever even HEARD of an electronic device taking that long ? Would it kill them to install a simple on-off switch instead ? The 5 operating buttons on the back are identically shaped ( except for the round power button ) . This makes it difficult to use since you have to look at the front of the screen and feel for the buttons , usually hitting the wrong one . You end up having to turn the frame over and back many times to go through the menu and make your selections . It 's understandable that they 'd put the buttons on the back , given it 's intended use as a wall hanging , it just would have been more user friendly if they varied the size and shape of the buttons , or their location , so you could distinguish one from another without having to visually confirm it . The manual says that you can download files directly from your PC to the photo frame using a ( not supplied ) USB cord and a somewhat fussy procedure . I tried this and it didn't work . I ended up downloading my picture files using the same compact flashcard reader I use to download the files from my camera to my PC , and then inserting the card into the photo frame . If you load directly from your camera to your PC you might have a problem . So far , I haven't had the problem identified in one review of having the compact flash card fall through the opening to loosely rattle inside the device , but after reading that and checking the unit , the writer is right . It would be easy to do , and a major pain . You do have to be careful . The menu gives you the options of randomly choosing picture files to display and whether or not to repeat them . It doesn't give you the option of viewing them in chronological or filename order . Because most cameras name photo files with a numbering system , you assume that the computer chip would default to showing them in that order . That 's not how this device works . It may be a result of how the computer saves the files to the memory card , but it doesn't display the files in the order they appeared on your PC when you downloaded them . That may not be a problem in some cases , but will be in others . Potential buyers should give some consideration to the orientation of the photo 's they may display ( portrait vs . landscape ) . By default , portrait oriented photo 's are displayed in landscape format , greatly reducing their size and adding some distortion . The software allows portrait formatted photos to be changed to display in full screen , but it 's an 8 step process requiring the aggravating back and forth motion described above and it often doesn't work . It 's much easier to do it on your PC ( a fact the manual points out ) . Mixing the two formats is not advised if you intend to hang the frame or display it on a table . A related enhancement would be to give you the option of displaying all portrait oriented photo 's and then the landscape oriented ones , although this would only be useful for hand held viewing . If you regularly mix the orientation of your photos , this might be an issue for you . The MosaicView is hardly the " exciting new technology " lauded in the manual , but rather a minor obstacle most users will choose to ignore . After all , why pay a premium price to buy a photo frame with a larger screen , only to display images at a quarter of that size ? MosaicView makes the orientation problem even worse because it packs 4 photos on the screen , which just squeezes and distorts the portrait files even more . The stand that attaches to the frame is easy and convenient for landscape view , but a pain to convert to portrait . Instead of integrating that option into the design , you have to remove 4 teeny tiny screws , turn part of the stand platform , and then replace the screws . Unless you routinely carry a jewelers screwdriver , plan on at least a 10-minute job . The power cord is 6 feet long , making it just long enough to reach from your average wall socket straight up the wall for an average height viewer . A few more feet would cost next to nothing and at least give you the option of trying to hide the cord behind a curtain or the woodwork as it works its way up your wall , or alternatively , to pass the frame from person to person while sitting in your living room . After using this thing for a couple weeks , my biggest gripe is that I think the designers really missed the boat on what could be the best use of this product , which is as a hand held picture viewer . IMHO , what this country needs is an easy way to share digital pictures when you 're not sitting at a computer . I 'd hoped that I could use this as a replacement to prints in informal settings . I thought that at work , in a restaurant , or when I have friends over and want to pass around my latest vacation photo 's , I 'd be able to pass it from person to person , letting them advance each frame by pushing a button . While you can do that with practice , the power cord and button location makes this pretty inconvenient . If this thing was battery operated and had more user-friendly operating buttons , I think the market would recognize it as the final link in the digital loop , a convenient way to carry and show your digital photos . For those that feel my criticism is misplaced because it focuses on a use not intended by the manufacturer , you 're right . If all you want to do is hang this device on the wall and forget about it , these concerns probably won't be much of a drawback . To be fair , the screen delivers very acceptable sharpness at a resolution of 800 x 400 and the small size of the files required at that resolution mean you can pack a lot of pictures onto a pretty inexpensive memory card ( one caveat noted below ) . That capacity is poorly matched to the software 's navigation system however , which requires you to move through each picture one at a time if you want to save a picture to the internal memory ( on the other hand , the manual gives no reason why you 'd want to do that , so most people won't bother ) . In the final analysis , I think most users will want greater flexibility to use this device as a portable photo album . If that 's important to you , you should think about waiting for the next generation . One final note : For users of compact flash cards , a word of advice . The quality of the card makes a difference ! I first tried an old Kodak 16MB card because it was large enough to handle the 200 pictures I wanted to view after I saved them to an 800 x 400 resolution , but I noticed distinct digital artifacts making squared lines in circle or wave patterns through what should 've been a smooth transition of color in many pictures . At first I thought it was a reflection of the 800 x 400 screen resolution , but after switching to a 1GB Sandisk card , the problem went away . This probably goes for other types of memory cards as well .  
2	  I loved the ease of using this device . When I first took it out for a test drive I delibertaley ignored directions to see how the recalculating route function worked and it performed flawlessly !  
2	  Not an audiofile but these sound great ! they leak sound like crazy though . Perfect for at home listening but not really the best for listening out and about .  
2	  The Coby 5.6 " Digital Photo Frame arrived very quick and in great shape . It is easy to operate and looks very nice . We did not load the MP3 as we were not wanting this function and had read disappointing reports . The slide show looks very nice and made a great present . Wish there was a larger screen with the same design .  
1	  So what if the resolution is spectacular or the battery life is decent if the M515 turns on at the slightly touch or bump and inevitably drains the battery , rendering the M515 nothing but dead weight in my purse or briefcase ? My M515 is " protectected " by a leather case from none other than Palm . There are two little bars across the bottom of the case that are supposed to prevent the front half of the case from pressing on the buttons across the bottom of the M515 . BUT THEY DON'T WORK . If you put the slightest amount of pressure on the case , the M515 turns on and eventually drains the battery . I just carry around ( never toss or drop ) my purse or briefcase . Maybe the problem is solved by having a hard case but I 'm sickened and angered by how Palm can market the M515 without being honest and upfront about the ridiculous feather-touch turn on feature or the requirement for a hard case . I used to be a Palm loyal . Now I hate Palm . I wish I had realized the problem within the return period . Otherwise , I would not be left with a useless piece of junk . If I 'm missing something , like some trick to lock the keys , someone PLEASE let me know . The M515 is driving me nuts .  
2	  I bought and tried several higher-priced , name-brand competitors headphones to hear which ones actually cancelled out background noise . If you buy , try and compare you have a better chance of getting what you expect . The others that I tried had NO DISCERNABLE noise cancellation and / or , did not have sufficient volume for use within an airplane cabin . While this one lacks an auto-off switch , which can save batteries , and has no remote volume control , it works great at noise cancellation . I wouldn't argue that it has audiophile fidelity , but if you want to watch a movie on your computer , this makes it possible .  
2	  This is the second Bluetooth mouse I 've owned . The first Bluetooth mouse ( from a different manufacturer ) was so bad , I took it back after 2 days because : - The 2 AA batteries went flat after 2 days . - After letting the mouse sit for a minute , moving the mouse gave no cursor movement until it came out of some sort of deep sleep . - It performed badly on timber surfaces . The Microsoft Laser 8000 has none of these faults . I 've been using it for almost 3 weeks with min 12hr days and it has taken this long for the battery to go flat . Actually , it 's not flat , but the red light says it 's time for a charge . Amazing . The mouse performs very well on timber surfaces , although it can do a minor mistrack sometimes , but not enough to cause frustration . It shows zero delay after leaving the mouse sit for any length of time - the cursor responds instantly . The power switch is great , making it easy to throw the mouse in the backpack when travelling from home to the office or further . Initially I was sceptical about the smooth spin scroll wheel , but now I 'm a convert . Good Points : - Battery life from a single charge lasts easily over 2 weeks . - Single AA battery ( cheap to buy & carry an emergency replacement if necessary ) . - Power switch , great for switching the mouse off before travelling . - Perform well on timber surfaces and every other surface I 've tried . - Cursor responds instantly , even if the mouse has been untouched for hours . Bad points : - The mouse requires the charging base to get recharged . The charger won't plug directly into the mouse and the mouse can't be plugged into a USB port to charge . This is bad for travellers , but at least the charging base is flat so it packs easily . - The scroll wheel is stiff to press ( ie middle mouse button ) . Another review said the Instant View feature only works with the dongle . This wasn't the case for me . I have an IBM T42 and all the features work with the laptop 's built in Bluetooth transceiver . I must confess I didn't like this feature as I use the middle button for other things . In summary , I 'm very happy with it . The pros easily outweigh the cons , so I have no qualms recommending it .  
1	  I bought this remote to use with my 27 " Panasonic CRT TV in the bedroom . The OEM remote lost button functions over time-just like the previous , more expensive Sony RM-VL900 I bought to replace it . The same thing has happened to this remote ! I 'm beginning to wonder if the TV is somehow the cause of this recurring problem . The main channel Up-Down buttons no longer work , so one cannot scan channels . The individual channel and PIP button still work , but only one of the PIP scan buttons function . The only way to surf is to bring up the PIP window , use the lone PIP scan button , then punch in each channel one wants to watch . I have a Universal MX500 for the main TV , and have had no problems whatsoever with it . Of course , it cost well over $ 100 , and I just don't have that kind of $ nowadays . I 'll just have to hope I can find an inexpensive remote that will maintain button function for more than a few months !  
2	  I ordered this unsure if it was going to work . I am so glad to have found it because my GPS was useless without the cord . Works great adn once again I am enjoying my directions !  
2	  If price was a factor , this might be a 3-star review . I 'm reviewing it assuming price is not an issue and you are willing to pay for the model . Positives :* Comes with Pocket PC 2003 ( Windows Mobile 2003 ) , which has worked out some of the bugs of PPC2002 , so I understand . Seems a pretty stable OS . * 128 MB is just the best ( for now ! ) . This is great if you love to install tons of stuff on the unit . * With the 48MB of ROM and the OS , there is about 17MB left over for Ipaq file store . Another bonus in space . * Wifi is nearly perfect . Picks up access points without a hitch . Only minor problem might be that it 's " too " excited sometimes and forgets that a certain access point is no longer around , so you have to manually remove it from the list . * Internet apps pretty good : Pocket IE , Messenger , W Media * Also easily used 3rd party software to browse my network and play tunes off another computer . * Syncs over wifi . This is so great ! * Easy syncing with outlook , of course . Syncs IE favorites , too . * Unit ships with a higher capacity battery than the others ( 1250 vs . 900 mAh ) * Fingerprint reader is faster than entering a PIN or a password . Also many security possibilities ( i.e. fingerprint OR pin , fingerprint AND pin , etc . ) * Voice recorder is handy . Negatives :* Price / Value ratio is fairly high . It seems that you could have a comparable unit with the 2215 , a wireless card and some extra ram for about $ 100 cheaper . * The microphone / headphone jack is not flush with the bottom of the unit , but inset ( see angle pic ) . Some of my headphone jacks sleeves are too fat to push the plug in all the way . This is a big design flaw . * With all the stuff it 's got , it is on the heavier side of the PDA weight spectrum . * Big processor and battery means it gets very warm ! * It 'd be nice if printing over a network was a possibility . Can't seem to be able to do this . * IE is somewhat boiled down . No easy way to save a picture on a webpage like the desktop version of IE . * Charging with USB is possible , however the unit seems to wake up and want to sync even though I set syncing to manual . Doesn't go back asleep and won't USB charge while on . No comment :* Haven't been able to test bluetooth for lack of other devices carrying this technology . * Haven't used SD slot yet . * Haven't used the ipaq expansion pack , but this apparently allows it do do oh so much more ! :) - Buzz  
2	  After upgrading from standard 8mm tape to MiniDV I could not be more happy . Very simple to operate for a novice , but the more I learn the better I am in photo situations which used to leave me flat on my face . Menus , manual parameters , automode , optical stabilization , 3 CCD 's , and the design and ergonomics are great . My only gripe is the poor response in low light situations . My previous sonycam did MUCH better . I better invest in a light .  
1	  I got this for exporting eyeTV recording to appleTV format and first time a try at the end of the process it give an error message and does not create a file . After checking the web site it turns out it is a know bug . When it works it encodes video in a 1to1 speed ( one hour recording takes one hour to encode in a mac mini ) . I am disappointed because my main use was Apple TV encoding . My other use is iPod encoding and that appears to work ok . When using Turbo . 264 , some exports to the Apple TV format may failSolutionWhen using Turbo . 264 , some exports to the Apple TV format may fail before completing . If you are exporting from within EyeTV , the error reported will be something like 0xE0004051 or 0xE00002E0 . You may also see a blank , grey window with the Turbo . 264 icon in one corner . If you are exporting using the Turbo . 264 application , version 1.2 , the error will be something like - 536870176 . In either case , Turbo . 264 is prevented from completing the export , due to an issue with the firmware inside the unit . This issue is particular to the Apple TV export preset . This issue is being researched with the assistance of the hardware manufacturer , and once a solution is found , a software update to Turbo . 264 should resolve the problem . Until then , there are a few workarounds you can use : 1 ) Export using a setting other than " Apple TV " , like " iPod High " . 2 ) Customize your Apple TV export , reducing the resolution by 16 pixels in both directions . 3 ) Unplug and replug the Turbo . 264 before starting the export . Any of these three steps should allow the export to complete . We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience that this error has caused .  
1	  My unit , which I bought from Amazon , had a whole bunch of problems . Out of the box , it has two bad pixels . One is always orange , the other one is always greenish . They are quite noticeable . It sucks to pay 2k + for a screen that is flawed . When channel surfing with this thing , it occasionally resets itself ; turns itself off and then back on . The biggest problem with my tv is that once a while it can't be turn on . The power light and OPC light would flash on and off , pressing the power button on the remote and the set won't turn it on . I would have to unplugg the power cord and then plug it back in for this thing to work again . When it works , the picture quality and black levels are very good . I 've contacted Sharp customer service . We have not reached a solution yet .  
1	  the description would lead you to believe that the ink cartridges will fit all picturemate printers , but this won't fit the smaller printers like the PM 225 picturemate charm  
1	  The binoculars are cheaply made . If you look through the the other end with some light , you 'll the big globs of glue holding things in place .  
1	  i never received mystuff and amazon will not replace becuase they lost it in the mail and will not send me another thank you .  
2	  I use this earphone mainly when doing exercise and they meet expectations . They are a big upgrade for exercising vs the normal earphones that are introduced in the ear .  
1	  I bought the Apex ADV-3800 from Amazon because it seemed like a great price . I had no problems with it at first . Then , a malfunction started . I no longer got video output from the DVD player . I could still view cable channels and VHS tapes fine . But when I switched to DVD mode , the screen would go black ; there wasn't even the generic-blue DVD screen . If I inserted a DVD and pressed the buttons in the right order , I could get the DVD to play . However , I only heard the audio ( which came through flawlessly ) ; the screen was still black . I tried calling Apex 's customer service number ( both the California area code and the toll-free ) . They were busy every single time . Except for once . The one time that it wasn't busy , I was on hold for over 3 hours before I gave up waiting . ( In that time , I went from # 17 to # 3 in the queue , according to the recorded voice . ) I also posted my problem on their website . They promised a reply within 24 hours but none came after 5 days of waiting . I even called one of the companies listed on the Apex website as a licensed repair company . The company told me that they also have great difficulties with Apex , especially in getting hold of them on the phone . Spend your money on a product supported by a company that will actually help you if anything goes wrong . Avoid Apex . I 'd give them zero stars if I could .  
1	  Do NOT BUY this product if you plan on using it in France ! We charged the product and tested it in the U.S. and it seemed to work fine . We specifically got it for our trip to France . We get to Paris , turn it on , it loads up to 43 % and then says it does not have enough memory to work . We tried it twice more and the same thing happened . I have no idea if the same thing would happen in other European countries since we only tried it in France . I hope this review helps those from making the same mistake we did .  
1	  I purchased this product about two months ago . I noticed the lack of the traditional cap-lock and num-lock indicator LEDs right away . I also noticed the very short receiver range . The last straw came yesterday when the mouse died and I had to go back to my old one to continue working . If you need to go cordless I suggest going to a better quality product . It may cost more up front but will be more reliable than this one .  
1	  I bought it in December , 2003 . From the very beginning , DVD-R 's would occasionally freeze and then , after a few seconds , would recover . However , commercial discs played without incident , so I believed the problem was the DVD-Rs . I was wrong . After six months of service , even commercial DVD 's began to freeze . Finally , in June of 2004 , it totally died . A commercial DVD ( The Wizard of Oz ) froze after 10 minutes of play and the machine never recovered ; it failed to recognize any type of disc , and is now garbage .  
1	  I did not have high expectations for these speakers , but I thought they would deliver decent sound for the money . I should have read the negative reviews ! On the plus side , the speakers sound okay in the mid-upper range ( though mid is a little lacking ) . Also , distortion is not an issue at reasonable volumes . But the bass is ridiculous . It 's muddy , and what it lacks in clarity it makes up in volume . Way too much volume . Even at the lowest setting , the bass dominates the music . I 've managed to corral it for the most part using an equalizer , but then I have to switch presets every time I listen to music with headphones . I don't hate bass . I have a Hsu VTF-2 subwoofer for my home theater and it rocks the house . But it also knows its place . The sub on the Logitech doesn't . I would give this product one star if it wasn't so easy to use an equalizer . The sound out of the box is simply unacceptable .  
1	  Very annoying background hum / buzz that comes from the unit , not the receiver . Others have commented on this , and it seems that this is a very basic engineering problem XM could have taken care of during design , but seems they 'd rather rush out a piece of crap . Too bad there are no other real options out there for the office - I have the box right next to me at my desk , so I can't turn up the volume enough to drown out the noise . Save your money for the next generation of boxes - I wish I had .  
1	  I work with a live sound system installer that has used professional JBL concert speakers for 20 + years . So I was astounded to hear what passed as acceptable for their " consumer " line . Simply put , the subwoofer puts out deep bass , while the two little speakers put out a mid-treble range .. but nothing in between ! I thought , " WTF happened to my music ? " It 's almost as if they just forgot to add a woofer to the mid-range satellite speakers . The music sounds weak and distorted . ( These were uncompressed Apple Lossless tracks , btw . ) Try something else , please .  
2	  I got the item quickly and in perfect condition .  
2	  These speakers were used as my rear surround in my entertainment setup . For 4 years , they served their purpose flawlessly . I 've pushed them to their wattage limit and past it , with no issues whatsoever . I highly recommend these speakers , as they are probably the best bang for your buck you 'll find . And you CANNOT beat the piano finish for that price , just amazing .  
2	  I received this subwoofer as a Christmas gift ( 2011 ) . I recently put together a home theater in my basement with 7.1 sound , but due to budget constraints I was using an old subwoofer ( about 15 years old ) from a Home Theater in a box setup I had . I subwoofer was seriously underpowered and was barely noticeable . When I originally researched the components for my new setup I found this subwoofer and liked it because of its size and power to price ratio . I didn't expect anyone else to buy the unit for me , so when I opened the box on Christmas it was a complete surprise . Since all my research had been online only , I didn't know what it was at first because it was bigger and heavier than I had imagined . I hooked it up to my receiver ( Pioneer 1021K ) and was blown away . My first test was playing the blu-ray The Dark Knight . The windows were rattling and the couch was actually vibrating too . I turned down the power level to about 20 % ( and adjusted down the subwoofer output level on my receiver ) and found it to still be great sound and not quite so intense ( made the wife happy ) . I thought my home theater setup was good before , but this unit now makes it great . Totally recommend with no reservations .  
1	  This DVD was a mistake to purchase . It should have never left the factory . Poor sound , poor construction . The list goes on and on . Do not purchase this DVD .  
1	  I bought the 50 pack definitely for the price and the specs seemed to be ok . I got them and had them on reserve for when my current supply of a different brand runs out . Finally I went to use a disk out of the 50 pack in this years model of the Panaonic Home DVD Recorder . Not one single disk out of the top five was detected by the recorder . Now I am stuck with useless disks since my return date is passed with Amazon and I can't get a refund . Now I am glad I paid so little for them .  
1	  I got the router working without significant problems . However , I bought it on the promise that I could plug in a hard drive to the USB and share it with computers on my network . Turns out it doesn't expose a share - you have to install d-link 's " network usb utility " on each computer that will see the drive . I installed this , and immediately got a blue screen of death on my vista machine . Rebooting just led to more kernel failures . I couldn't uninstall in safe mode , and there was no configuration option to turn it off . Eventually , I was able to unplug the network and reboot successfully , and after trying to uninstall from a full reboot I got .. another blue screen of death . Router may work fine , but this feature is a dud .  
1	  Its works just okay / I took it to Hawaii on a trip and it lost signal about 75 % of the time . And worse than that when it was working it took us to the wrong place . I took it again on a trip to Flordia and it couldn't even find Disney world Or it would take me about two blocks from where I was supposed to be and lose signal . At home in Arizona after the trip the clock never worked corectly again . It does do better here in az , but again sometimes it will take you to the wrong place . If I had to do it again I would buy a better quality one and spend more money .  
2	  since I purchased this disc cleaner , I have no more skips , or distortions . It is everything I hoped it would be . It even keeps my dvd player working well . If I had a need I would deffinately buy another one .  
2	  I set this up to control a tivo with which I am using aSewell 2 Port 1x2 Powered Hdmi Splitter V 1.3b ( Up to 1080p ) 3D Certifiedsplitter to send the programming to two different televisions ( in adjacent rooms ) . I set up the x10 powermid with the antenna near the tivo and the x10 powermid without the antenna next to the television in the adjacent room . Plugged both in and it was already working . Fabulous ! It 's so nice to have the full functionality of the tivo on more than one television . One thing to consider : If the televisions are the same brand , using the tivo remote to turn on / off the second television may turn on / off the other television . A way around this would be to use the actual tv remote to turn on / off the tv in the adjacent room , and use the tivo to control everything else as usual . I am very happy with my purchase !  
1	  For some reason I thought this cable would fit an HP PSC printer , it does not . I searched for the printer I have and this came up .  
2	  Dropped right in . No mailing label to recycle the old one though . more empty words to please review entry box .  
1	  Philips just doesn't know what they 're doing , plain and simple . I went through 3 different units and they all had the same problems ! Read some of the other reviews for the list of problems ; I 've encountered most of them . I can't stress how bad their burners are ! What a headache having to send it out just to come back with the same problems .. on 3 different units none the less ! I finally demanded my money back from Circuit City ( who I wouldn't recommend either ) and went with the Pioneer 839 from Tweeter ( who are light years better than CC ) and have been very happy with it .  
1	  I wish that I could rate this product lower than 1 star . Where do I begin with my dissatisfaction ? The user manual included with the player was written in some of the most poorly translated English I have ever read . Here 's a sample : " The action of pressing contains four ways such as pressing shortly , pressing long , pressing and single pressing . The average meaning is pressing shortly except the particular instruction . " There is very little support software : a disk formatter and the firmware upgrader-no online help . The device , which plugs directly into a USB port , disconnects intermittently , which causes file corruption on the Flash disk . Files copied to the player sometimes appeared corrupted . On several occasions , after safely disconnecting the device , the entire contents of the MP3 player were lost , leaving only the empty folders . I 'm sending this back to Amazon immediately and getting an iPod shuffle , even though it 's twice the price .  
1	  Zipper broke after 5 days of light usage . Piece of junk ! It was made from a thin piece of metal - my pants zipper is lots stronger than this !  
1	  Does not support Vista 64-bit . I bought this at a retail store and the box says supports windows vista . I get the product home only to find out it does not support 64-bit vistas which is not on the box any where . Also if you need support over the phone its 24.95 the first 10 minutes and then a certain dollar amount for every minute after that . Doesn't look like a very good company .  
2	  At this price , who doesn't want one ! ? I got a whole bunch and gave it away to all my photographer friends !  
2	  Received quick . Looks & feels great . I gave as a xmas gift to hubby . He loves it ! It was made for a 17 " Laptop , but we have a 15 " .. still works great ! I 'm real happy with this purchase .  
2	  They are good quality and do the job just fine . No worries at all and a fraction of the price of what they want for them in the brick and mortar world .  
1	  I found this hair dryer to be much bigger then anticipated . The cord does not retract completely and has to be pushed in by handfor the last few inches . It is heavy and the handle is very bulky .  
2	  Beautiful cover , great quality , it looks like a nice case for a second camera , the magnetic clap is a very nice touch .  
1	  Got it on 5 April 2006 and it stopped working on 8 July 2006  
2	  This is the second best thing that my sweetie has bought me .. the first was a first generation nano . I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want the bulk of the ipod .. that is why I wanted the nano . It is sleek and so light weight I don't even know it 's there . Fantastic !  
1	  I 've had the linksys for 3 weeks now , and after spending several hours myself trying to set it up , I brought it to the office and had an IT person work on it . He has been unable so far to get it working properly . I 'm not a technical person , and I would just warn those of you who are similar to myself , that unless you have technical friends who can help you thru the setup process , you might consider going with a different product . The setup CD was WORTHLESS !  
2	  This 512mb Ultra II SD Card makes a world of difference if you have the right camera to take advantage of it . I currently use this card with my Canon SD200 which has a Digic II Processor . This awesome camera / card combo allowed me to quickly take multiple pics of runners during the LA Marathon . I was able to focus on certain runners and rapidly take pics before moving on to the next . After the 5 months of constant use I have not experience any problems with this card . I highly recommend it .  
2	  It is always really nerve-racking for me to make these kind of purchases because half the reviews for most products say " greatest thing ever , " and the other half " terrible ! " But the reviews seemed pretty good for the Zen 60 gb , so I decided to order it about 8 months ago . So far , so good . It has held up incredibly well . And the 60 gbs of space is hard to fill . I am up to 45 gb , and I have everything I could imagine wanting on it already ! The thing I like most about this player may simply be the fact that it supports so many formats . The major concern I had with getting an MP3 player ( and the reason why I didn't get an Ipod ) is whether or not my various video files and sound files would be difficult to get on here . And , it isn't hard at all . I have had zero problems now with the various formats of videos I download offline and whatnot , and it supports my music file of choice , WMA , perfectly . It would be cool if it supported WMA PRO , but apparently NOTHING does yet .. or at least nothing I have seen . I love the program it comes with . IT couldn't be easier . I select my music from my music folder , and load it right in . It could not be any simpler . I do not use it to compress music - my Windows media player does a great job at that - but I simply use the program to add files that have already been ripped onto my computer . Battery space is very good - I have yet to not have enough battery power for the various times I have used it . It was great when I flew to hawaii . I switched between listening to music and watching movies without running out of battery power . It seems to go about 3-4 hours on video depending on the loudness of volume . Obviously that exceeds the length of most movies . But the other thing I would HIGHLY recommend is getting a wall plug in and car adapter . I cannot stress how nice it has been to be able to charge this in my car , from a wall , and from my computer . Basically , there is hardly ever a time when I have to worry about it running out of battery power , because I can always charge it , from anywhere . I plug it in my mp3 line on my car , and listen endlessly . When I took a major road trip with my girlfriend , I listened to ( and she watched ) through a couple different movies . It was awesome ! So far so good with battery power , memory , and functionability . It looks like at 192 kbps , I can fit about 600 full length albums on here , along with about 70 vids . Hard to tell . Right now I have 440 albums at 192 kbps , and 70 vids , and I am I still have 15 gbs left .  
1	  I say don't buy unless you have a really old computer . i bought one and went to update the software for my window 7 computer . i found out that APC discontinued support for this in 2009 . so if your computer is still running windows xp or earlier then its okay .  
1	  I had always though that Nikon brand is one of the top one . How wrong I was .. :( This camera is the worst . I own 2 years old Kodac DC3400 2MP and believe you me this camera takes better quality , crisp photos not like Nikon . I could not focus this camera in more than half of the times . The time of flash to reload is a way to slow ( you 're talking about 3 to 4 sec minimum ) . The photos of the moving people appears so blury that it seems like I had tryed to shoot a " flighing " Formula 1 race car on a track . After more than 6 hours of frustraction , I am bringing this camera back to the store .  
1	  I don't know what people are raving about . The picture quality on this thing is absolutely horrible . I can see a better picture without my glasses than wearing glasses looking at a picture taken with this camera . I dont know the techy term but I think its called noise or lens aberation or something . I know its not a quality german lens like zeiss , or nikon or canon , but this camera i just horrible . Maybe ok for your 6 year old kid .  
2	  listen .. you 're life will never be the same with TiVo . I didn't convert until my two brothers kept recommending this product . Now you can watch AND record TiVo shows at the same time . If you miss the beginning / end - it doesn't matter - you can slew to whatever point in the recorded program . Sounds inconsequential , but it isn't when you 've missed the beginning of the nightly news , that all so important soap opera , or whatever your fancy . One of the best features is the fast forward / rewind 3-speed scan - once you hit play , it plays back at the last visual pause / transition , starting you at your program . The unit starts ' learning ' your TV preferences by content ; there 's also a personal voting scale so the unit can start learning and recording on downtimes . This is great for reruns - but becomes troublesome to delete constantly if you record at high quality resolution or have a ton of shows lined up . Also , there a ' season pass ' that essentially records the specified show whenever it appears in the tv lineup ; this is a problem if you 'd like to override just one of the shows for an alternate specific show . You 'll just have to revert back to manual setting of time / date recording . Oh , the setting of time / day recording like VCRs is over , you can search and select by show name , search by type of subject matter ( drama , news , etc ) . The term ' product ' is misleading - this machine is a computer with one / two hardrives , a modem that allows for updates , all the current input options ( satellite , S-video , RCA ) and comes with all the cables you 'll need and more . The all-knowing eye semantics on the front facia is a bit ominous , but true to its function . Since it 's inception , you can find extremely good bargains for refurbished units straight from the factory which work perfectly well . Get a unit with one harddrive if you 've got the choice .. research a bit and you 'll see why if you 're a hacker . The folks who designed and put all this together should get some sort of couch-potato award .  
1	  I try to use this cable whit my lcd and it burnt my video card , i think was the cable was wront , but what i con do now .. i lost my card . i cant recomende it  
1	  I gave this a two star rating because I am not for sure if it 's the battery that is dysfunctional or my phone . Honestly my phone could possibly have a malfunction that is keeping it from receiving a charge properly . I am unable to determine .  
1	  well , let 's just says i didn't expect much and that is exactly what i got . the speakers arrived on time and in good condition . them sound like they are in a deep well ( it is almost frightening ) you get what you pay for so next time i 'll pay more for the polk audio rm7 . they do play sound however scratchy and muffled it maybe  
1	  Software crashed my windows machine . Errors in recording . Not compatible with anything . Do not buy !  
1	  This Cisco product gave me the single most unpleasant consumer experience in recent memory . I have a 2wire router and standard Dell equipment . The setup instructions were totally irrelevant . The ethernet light refused to come on so I called tech support . I got to talk to some wonderful and patient people who live in India for nearly 2 hours . They carefully ran me through numerous operations connecting the device to both my computer and router . Unfortunately , the product was no closer to operational than when we started . I tried to call Cisco in San Jose using my dime but they have a foolproof telephone firewall which prevented any form of human contact including a very cool complex of circular menu trees which always took me back to where I started . I guess when you sell junk like this , you need to protect yourself from the shouts and jeers of the mob at the palace gate . Thank goodness for Amazon . This nasty piece of equipment is winging its way back for a refund . Maybe Amazon will simply discontinue offering this despicable product .  
2	  Nice picture , you forget its a small screen after using it for a little while . We have five of these and there isn't a single problem with any of them , I do wish they would have come with the audio cords too , but they are being using in a library so no big loss there .  
2	  I know that some reviewers had problems but here in Denver , CO it has worked perfectly at all times . I would recommend it . I bought it for 49.99 and it 's a great deal to have the charger capabilities also .  
1	  I suppose it 's my fault . Not only have I had bad experiences with HP 's printers in the past , I 've also worked as a telephone support tech and seen the lengths HP will go to disavow responsibility . Regardless , I was tempted , gave in and bought a product that will ensure I will stay away from HP in the future . The scanner / copier doesn't work .. never has . It produces poor quality images with strange lines through them . And trust me , I went through the troubleshooting on this one . The techs were at a loss . I never had problems with the software becoming corrupt , but it is a sprawling nest of different programs that tend to hog my system 's resources . Not appreciated . Worst of all is the feed problem mentioned by other reviewers , except that I have NEVER had a respite from it . Since the day I got it , and with all paper thicknesses from copier to cardstock , the printer will tell me that there is no paper when there 's a pile sitting in the tray . I have tried everything you can possibly imagine , but to no avail . I am reduced to feeding the printer sheets of paper ONE AT A TIME , by hand . The only reason this thing is not in pieces is that I cannot yet afford to buy a new printer .  
1	  BUYERS , BE AWARE.I had 2 DVD players made by Pioneer . They are nice machines .. for a little over a year . Then the warranty expires . The problem these players seem to have has to do with poorly designed dual laser pick up ( one - for DVDs , the other one - for CDs and Video CDs ) . The first player I had stopped playing CDs and Video CDs , I got the other one - this one stopped playing DVDs . On the positive side - the picture is very good , so if you are after a short-term buy go ahead , otherwise look for another brand .  
2	  Overall , this unit is pretty good considering the price . I have mine hooked up with HDMI for the video and I 'm going optical out for the audio into my Technics Dolby digital 5.1 audio receiver / amp . The sound is spectacular in true Dolby Digital . The video on the ATSC tuner channels is not true HD as it actually increases the size of the picture just a bit bigger than it 's native aspect ratio , thus cutting off part of the picture . But , it is a nice picture nonetheless . The DVD recorder is relatively reliable but the player has some quirks . Sometimes it 'll just stop playing . Possibly possessed ? Who 's to say . The digital tuner needs a strong clean signal , otherwise you can expect significant dropouts , to the point that it is unwatchable . The analog tuner works well and is what I use to watch most of my tv . You can record in a couple different formats for playback on your DVD player or PC . You can also transfer the files from a recorded DVD -R or DVD - RW to your your favorite video editing software on your PC . There are still a few of these around and I have no reservations recommending this unit . Just remember , it 's not true HD and that 's ok because I don't think a consumer HD DVD recorder even exists . But this is pretty close to it . Rob @ robdrew . com  
2	  I have had this product for almost a month now . So far it has worked as expected . It was simple to start using from the box . The reason for four stars vs five is there is slight static at times . And at least once on a 5 hr trip it seemed necessary to change stations to get better reception .  
2	  My only complaint about this unit is that the doors are a little difficult to line up . The door hinge screws are real small and the holes that you screw them into are kind of tight . I used a small , phillip-end , jeweler 's screw driver , but I also ended up reaming the hole with a small drill bit so that the screw can go in easier . I recommend a good , sure-grip screwdriver with a small phillip bit to do the job . Also , when I finished assembly , the doors had a tendency to scrape against the bottom of the cabinet stand . I suppose that problem could have been avoided if I had lined up the doors better , but what is an amateur builder to do ? Overall , I am satisfied with the unit despite some minor , construction flaws that could have been avoided with better tools and a better builder . The unit is very attractive looking as I prefer the media storage units with doors rather than the open racks . I highly recommend anchoring the unit to the wall for safety reasons . When the unit is full of DVD 's and / or CD 's it can tip over very easily .  
1	  This memory card was working great with my Canon A620 digital camera . It was really fast when taking pictures , shooting videos and transfering files to my PC . However , after one month of use it died on me . Now the camera reports a memory card error and it won't be read either with my card-reader plugged to the PC . I 've always trusted Sandisk and have many products from them and this is the first time it happens . I wish it could 've lasted longer , it was a joy to use . too bad ! ..  
2	  This is a really great bag for the cost - everyone comments that it is a great bag , and then is shocked when I tell them how little I paid for it . It 's genuine Canon , so if you 're big on the name like I am , that 's a nice plus . Another added bonus that I didn't know about before buying is that it has straps on the underside of the bag for a small tripod . You will be able to fit a TON of gear in this bag . I fit my DSLR camera , 3 lenses , a compact digital video camera , a point-and-shoot digital camera , DSLR charger / battery , camcorder charger / battery , extra media , manuals , install cd 's ( in case someone wants to see the photos on their home computer ) , cables ( firewire , usb ) , vertical grip , manuals , and I still have plenty of space left over . The only downside is that when I want to be mobile this is bigger and bulkier than I 'd like it to be . I need to find a bag that will safely fit my camera and one or two lenses , and that 's it . The bag is well constructed and feels like it will withstand years of abuse .  
1	  The capture software , Ad FullCap , requires a serial number different from the product ID # in order to open and run it . That number is not supplied in some packages , and you must e-mail tech support and wait for them to e-mail you back the number . Had there been any notice of this requirement , I would have e-mailed them before I wanted to capture video , instead of wasting the weekend I 'd cleared to do the the project .  
2	  Great for the price , haven't really put it to the test quite yet , but have used it a little and it seems to work very smoothly !  
1	  save your bucks from this poor quality product . I bought it @ walmart and one side couldn't work just after one month of use . I would recommend on sony or panasonic .  
1	  The cables are fine but the wrong color was sent . I ordered black and the order stated they were black but when I opened the box they were blue .  
1	  My Zen Vision M locked up several times over several months . The last time , it was permanent . I had to contact their customer support to begin the process of getting it fixed in the middle of January . I received incorrect information regarding product availability , long waits for the sync adapter to come back into stock before I could attempt to reload firmware ( I lost it ; my mistake ) , and finally after getting an RMA approval have now been waiting 17 business days from their date of receiving it for them to get replacement stock . They quote an average of 10 , but ask you to contact them if it is longer than 15 days . I have been told that they are going to replace it once they get stock back in . Although they have units to sell in stock , this does not mean that they use them to honor their warranty with . They will not give any sort of estimate when they may have replacement stock . Also , their web RMA status page may not get updated , or may post incorrect status . Oh , one other interesting feature of their support is that if you don't have a support contract and the unit is older than 3 months old , you have to pay another $ 25.00 for the testing . In the almost 2 months of dealing with this , Creative Labs has lost me as a customer , which I have been for over 10 years . Aside from the lockups , I liked the unit . I now have an iPod that I love and also had to use Apples ' Customer Support services . No problems . They dealt with the problem in a professional and efficient manner .  
2	  First off , I 'm a fan of 3-D items in general so when I can get a useful item covered in lenticular vinyl , I 'm in ! The color changing aspects are bright and lively ( I have the red / blue ) and the zipper is plastic with a solid metal zipper pull . I 've filled the sleeves to near capacity and the case doesn't seem overly stuffed . The insert is the standard clear / white fabric backed cd / dvd sleeve , cheapish but fine . Outer case is quite strong and thre zipper well sewn to the casing . I find these great and a friend loved the idea of a dvd library looking so flash . Love ' em !  
2	  Wow , this has more features than I anticipated . Voice recorder , plays multiple auidio / video formats without restrictions like the Ipod has .. and gives you the ability to partition the hard drive for PC usability .. translation : If you want , you can make this into a 1GB mp3 player , 59 GB USB Drive ! Which means you can store any type of information on this for transfers between PCs . Regular 4GB and up USB drives cost a few hundred dollars , so this is definately an added benefit . You can sync with Outlook , and have your appointments , tasks , and contacts sync'ed .. Awesome ! :) Enjoy !  
1	  I was very disappointed in this product . The music sounds tinny and I had to turn the volume up . The earbud is comfortable , but the earbuds that came with my iPod are better . It wasn't worth ordering .  
1	  this item in not what is described to be and i had to return it after i purchased it . maybe for some other computer but definetly not for IMAC G4 1.0 GHz .  
1	  Not bad ink , but it only lasted for about 100 pages .  
1	  The Kodak Easyshare EX-1011 Digital Picture Frame is a good product unless you want to use one of its most highly touted features of wireless capability . The onboard memory works great , the USB input capability works great ( using a thumb drive as input as well as direct connect to the computer ) , and the SD card input works great . However , if you want to use the WiFi connection within your home to display your photos from your computer located in some other portion of your home , forget it . After weeks , I have still yet to have success in getting the unit to communicate wireless to my computer . It connects to the network okay , but talking to the computer is another issue entirely . I 've tried to get support from Amazon as well as the Beach Camera , the company Amazon works with for this product and Kodak - all with no success . By the way , be aware also of the Kodak Easyshare software suite that literally takes over your computer and installs gobs and gobs of unwanted / undesired software . I have not determined specifically yet , but I believe the software actually contains a rootkit . Right now , I 've completely uninstalled the Kodak software suite because it took my computer to its knees and corrupted my registry in the process . So , if you want to use WiFi with the unit or the software that comes with the product on your computer , I suggest you look for another vendor 's digital picture frame product .  
1	  headband is very flimsy and will not stay on my head . I spend the majority of my workout holding the ear pieces to my ears . The headband piece needs to be a little more ridged . The price is right , I guess - but would not recommend . Looking for a different product .  
1	  It is not reliable . Works 90 % of the time which sounds good but 1 out of 10 times we have looked out in the parking lot and there are customers and the unit did not work . VERY BAD . We have replaced the cr123 's which are not cheap and it did not help . If it is just a casual concern if you " want " to know if a vehicle has come in , then the unit is for you . If you MUST know everytime , don't buy it . A reasonable price for this unit should be in the $ 20-$40 .  
1	  I didn't like installing this printer at all . It was recommended above the Lexmark I use at work and was looking to buy , by the sales person and I should have gone with the Lexmark . The first time it didn't install and when I tried to remedy the problem , following the directions exactly , it crashed my entire system . It took me 3 days and a lot of time with the tech to correct the problem and I am still having errors . Maybe it 's because I run Windows ME but this printer has been a complete disaster . I also don't like the color quality . It reads color much darker than what 's on the screen and everything has a very blue tint . I will be replacing this printer as soon as I can with a Lexmark .  
1	  The first couple of months we loved this player and loaded our whole CD collection onto it . In month eight , the player battery would no longer charge with an AC or car adapter . We drained the first battery and bought a new battery . While trying the various suggestions from the Creative Help Lab , the second battery also failed to charge . I haven't found the help lab all that " helpful , " either .. mainly an overall lack of understanding the problem we stated and the troubleshooting measures we had already taken .  
1	  I have bought ink catridges elsewhere for a while now because Amazon does not offer free shipping on this product anymore ..  
2	  The main problem with my Palm TX is the fact that I 'm forever misplacing the stylus . I now have several on my workstation , they have built in pens as well .  
2	  Our family has owned a Sony DSC-770 for about three months now and We love it . Every member in the family can take pictures with and have great looking pictures . I also own a SLR camera but the features and manual capabilities of the DSC-770 has clearly made me a believer that this digital camera is far more superior for both the beginner and expert photographer .  
2	  After getting my Dell Axim , I had to go out and find the perfect CF Card . After doing much research and then comparing prices , the Viking 512MB CF Card was the best on the market . I have had it for 8 months and not a hickup . It has worked perfectly . The Read / Write for the card is more than satisfactory . After buying the 512 for my PDA I bought a 512 for my Nikon Digital Camera and have had the same wonderful experience .  
2	  I bought this camera after a thorough review of the market including the competition . For me , it would have been a winner in this comparison anyway , but there was also the matter of compatibility with the 3 lenses I had for my EOS 1000 : a Canon EF 35-80 , a Tamron 28-80 and a Sigma 70-210 . I thought I could make use of my previous investment . Here are the bad news : Albeit the promises , it does not work ! I haven't tried the Canon lens , but the Tamron and the Sigma both don't work . They mount alright physically , but then I get an error when trying to shoot and I have to turn the camera off and on again . Couldn't produce even one shot with them . This is a huge dissapointment . The good : other than that , it 's a great camera . I 'm using it with a SanDisk 2GB ULTRA II CompactFlash Card bought for ~ $ 20 here , and I get excellent shots . The response and speed are great - I take multiple shots per second . Operation is pretty easy . The bottom line : an excellent digital SLR for the serious amateur . But don't count on it to work with your older EF-compatible lenses . ( disclaimer - there could theoretically be a problem with my lenses . They have been sitting for a while . But what are the odds 2 of them are broken ? unfotunately I curerntly have no way to check them independently ) .  
2	  I bought this last November . Since then , I 've watched a wide variety of movies on it . Everything from B & W ; oldies to the latest films . The effect is incredible . It 's like owning your own movie theater . I 'm surprised more people aren't using these things instead of buying big-screen TVs . The Optoma is light , small , portable , very easy to use , and gives wonderful picture and sound . A big TV has a way of " becoming " the room . With this , when you 're done with it , you can just put it away . The only fault it has is that ( unlike a big TV ) you need a darkened room to view the picture . If that isn't a problem , this might be for you . I don't own a movie screen . I project my image onto a white wall . The image I get is about 14 feet wide . With older films , the picture almost stretches from floor to ceiling . Few gadgets have really changed my life , this one has . It has rekindled my love for great movies . I can see details and sense the power in the images that I 've missed on TVs .  
2	  The Tivoli Pal and iPal ( they 're the same radio ) are very simple , but pleasing radios . Doesn't have the latest features such as HD , Sirius or XM reception . But it does have a built-in rechargeable battery . Another great feature is that because it 's so simple and has no alarm or clock , I never have to worry about flashing lights or any other annoyances . I use the iPal in my kitchen , where the small footprint is much appreciated . It would also be useful on a bathroom counter . I also like the built-in rechargeable battery-should keep the radio going for a few hours in case of power outage or emergency . Also nice if you like to carry the radio around the house or outdoors . The sound quality is good , given its small mono speaker . I assume you can get better audio quality from the iPal 's stereo headphone output , but I haven't tried that . If you want to use the Pal / iPal with an iPod or other audio device , the input is stereo and so is the headphone output , as I mentioned before . The Aux input and the headphone output are on the back of the radio . However , there is no " Aux " setting on the front of the radio , so you 'll need to plug the iPod into the radio when you want to listen to your iPod through the Tivoli , then unplug your iPod when you want to go back to listening to the radio . An " Aux " setting on the front of the Tivoli would be a useful addition . Another note : As previously mentioned , the Tivoli Pal and iPal are the same thing . The only differences are the colors and also that the iPal includes a short audio cable to connect the iPod 's headphone output to the Pal / iPal 's Aux input . Overall , it 's a very simple ( but elegant ) and useful radio , within it 's limitations . For me , the limitations ( such as the lack of a clock , alarm , or presets ) add to the appeal .  
2	  My favorite gadget is my Clie . It includes camera , mp3 player , and universal remote control . It is very sturdy and takes abuse quite well ( I 've dropped mine several times ) . Pictures are really good and the color display makes Bejeweled even more addicting .  
2	  I 've been going through speaker systems left and right the past week and this Creative Labs T3000 is the only one that stays . The bass is clean and blends well . The midrange is a little too forward for some recordings but a simple equilizer adjustment smooths it right on out . ( If I could not make an E.Q. adjustment then I wouldn't want them . ) The highs are pleasant and not too gritty or harsh . There is a smoothness in the top end that the others lacked .. cymbals sound like cymbals . Hard to fault for $ 50.00 . Played softly to moderatly it has a very classy sort of sound . Push the bass or volume too hard and it sounds like crap . After all , 50 bucks is 50 bucks so don't expect too much .. but among it 's peers it 's head and shoulders above the rest . And I intensley dislike the sound quality in the rest of the Creative lineup . Spending more gets you less unless it 's more bass you want . My listening habits are piano , classical , classic rock and pop rock . If you are into bass heavy music pushed hard or a home theater thumper then this is not the one . If you want a speaker that can reasonably reproduce the music then this is worth a try . If you are really picky then go buy a nice amp and a high quality two way book shelf or perhaps a nice 2.1 . $ 50.00 will not buy a miracle . All I want is something that sounds pleasant without irritating . This T3000 and a simple Bose 2.0 are the only ones I 've heard that could pull that off in my opinion . I prefer the sound of these to the others I 've listened to at Circuit City and Best Buy in the $ 49.00 to $ 149.00 range . That does not mean I am right , only that I prefer the sound of these . Prefereance can't be agrued against , it 's what I like . You may not like what I like and that 's O.K. , so please listen for yourself .  
1	  It is not a Quick-release head tripod ! and it is a bit too short .  
2	  I bought this same camera in Aug-07 for $ 172.00 / free s / h . The part of the camera i STILL love , is how quickly i can switch it over to start recording short video clips of my grandsons ~ very important ! Yes , i have gotten my moneys worth out of it already , lots of great pics & videos I 'm happy with .. i just wish this camera would 've lasted longer ! No matter what batteries i use / brand / just any , it no longer " takes " the battery & lets me take pics or videos , it immediately closes up on me , i can no longer use it at all :* ( I never did get to learn all the different features on this camera before it puked on me , my own fault .. its not for 1st time users if you don't like to do alot of reading , messing around with all the features since its so much higher priced now than i payed .. think you can find something cheaper money wise if you 're like me & only used it for basic pics & quick video clips . I had fun while it lasted .. just glad i didn't pay this higher price .  
2	  Our old clock radio finally failed and I searched for a good altenative with small footprint , good sound and ease of use . My searching led me to the Acoustic Receptor Clock Radio . It has turned out to be an excellent choice . My wife and I really enjoy the sound and the improved reception compared to our old radio .  
1	  I paid what I thought was a premium price for premium speakers which sound like cheasy 1950s paper spekers . No bass , buzzes , no dynamic range , etc . , etc . etc . These speaker are all ads , ads , ads . No delivery at all . I have them hooked up to a good Denon 200 Watt receiver , and zip performance . Nada . They sound a thousand times worse than the rotted out 20-year-old Radio Shack speakers they replace . Bose is all puff and guff ! No wonder they dont sell in regular audio stores ; no one will handle this junk ! Garbage ! I was ripped off ! I am going back to Radio Shack . At least I dont feel bad paying nothing for junk then . And their junk is at least priced right . Jim Isham , Penfield , NY . God , this pisses me off . Bose can go jump in the lake and take their overhyped overpriced speakers with them ; tied to their feet !  
2	  I bought this item now for the third time . Last summer I purchased 2 of them , and they worked out great . I have another camera now and decided to get a 3rd one for simultaneous use on 3 cameras . Not sure about the other reviewers , but this 58mm circular polarizer glass filter works perfect for capturing and enhancing clouds , which is what I mostly do time lapses of and use this for . I 've not had any issues with the construction at all . I received the item in mint condition , no scratches or fingerprints on the glass .  
1	  No Support from either Veo or Xirlink & we had big Trouble with the 6mb internal memory of the camera . We sent numerous emailsand wrote letters to Xirlink and Veo . No one seems to care ! We never heard from anyone ; so we can only advise that youare on your own when it comes to customer support . We had chronic problems with the 6 MB internal memory on thecamera and could get no pics from it . But when we addedthe SD memory card , we were able to get it to work . It'san average camera and produces some pretty good pics , butdon't expect too much . It has no flash , but we got somepretty cool pics at a concert where the performer was in the spotlight . But you won't get any pics with room light . Don'tthink you can wear it on your keychain though , as theyadvertise . It 's made of cheap plastic and you 'll see thatit 's a pretty fragile camera that even needs to be protected . It 's pretty sad , though , that they don't care about theircustomers . And for that reason , we can't recommend thiscamera .  
2	  Just purchased my 10th IO gear USB-serial adapter . I have been using these for 4 years or so . We use these for programming access to PLC 's , drives , and other industrial automation equipment . No problems with 32bit XP or Windows 7 . Have not tried with other Operating Systems . We frequently use 2 or 3 adapters at one time on a single laptop . Great device .  
2	  You just can't ask for anything more . Truly great price - I paid 300 times the product 's price just to ship it . Arrived when I was told that it would . Works perfectly . Our Garmins are back with the latest software and maps .  
2	  This unit provides protection without adding much weight or taking up much space . Great for travel .  
2	  This DVD player is great , but not perfect . It can play DVD + R and DVD-R . I 've tried both . No problem at all . I use DVI cable on my SONY HDTV , switching to 480p , 720p , and 1080i but I really can't tell the difference ( I watch Spider-Man 2 , which is an original , not on DVD + R or DVD-R ) . It 's just unnoticeable . Probably it 's because its 480p performs too well . Besides , you can't do the switch via the remote . There is a button on the machine and everytime you want to make a change of output mode , you need to go to the machine and press the button . What most disappoints me is it does NOT support Video CD ( VCD ) format . For some people like me , VCD is very important . But if you only take it as a pure DVD player , it does its job quite well . Oh no , I should say it 's the best one I 've ever seen .  
1	  had to return as it didnt work for SD card , first bad exp with amazon .  
2	  I put these bookends in a noncomforming bed room , which is now my hobby room ( hide out ) . I hooked up my Marantz diesel and ran them like I stolded them . Break-in over , if you play 'm over the max volume of your Luv 'd Ones voice you will be ok . Heck I like them . If you what good sounding thupping bass , get drag pipes . If you don't know drag pipes I can't help you .  
1	  Here 's the scoop with this product . The base product and card work fine . However my woes started when I tried connecting to my company VPN it would not work . I followed the instructions to enable it - but the some of the settings would not stick in the firmware . Finally I followed instructions to reset the box - a bad mistake . The system does not work - asks you to load a new firmware . When you go to the d-link web site there is no firmware . I contacted their support - they asked me to return it to my local store which I did and got a new box .. same problem . Now d-link acknowledges that the unit does not have any firmware to download .. basically this is an unsupported product . The d-link tech supports folks are sympathetic but the only thing they will do is to replace it with the same model type which of course is worthless to me . So my advise is to stay away from this product . It is a badly designed product with a fundamental flaw where the reset button destroys the firmware and worse there is no firmware that you can download .  
2	  I like how the plug-ins are arranged and color coordinated . I have had no problems with any electrical surges as of yet . Since I live in central Florida I 'm hoping I won't have to find out just how well or not this surge protector works .  
1	  The picture is a power supply , the item is a power cord for a laptop .  
1	  It 's really pretty but it 's not region free . It plays only region 1 . At first I was confused so I called the manufacturing company and asked them , and they said that this DVD player is only capable for playing region 1 DVDs .  
1	  After market device not purchased from the manufacturer so no tech support was available . Way too complex for non tech savy purchaser . Waste of money !  
1	  There is a bug in this router that does not allow you to override the DNS servers provided by your ISP . The function is there in set up ; it just doesn't work . If you disable accepting the DNS from your ISP and enter your own primary backup DNS servers , it keeps the primary and secondary from your ISP and adds the primary you entered as a third , ignoring the secondary you entered . Tech support conceded that " this is the way the function works . " ' Doesn't work ' would be more accurate . If you like to use a DNS service like OpenDNS ( something everyone should consider ) , skip this router .  
1	  I can't say anything bad about the picture quality but autoprogramming the channels was a nightmare . Apparently I must have gotten a bad model because I haven't read anything about anyone else having a problem with the autoprogramming . When I started the autoprogramming to scan for all the channels it ran just fine at first . It loaded the channel numbers and then it started going through and loading the digital channels . The progress bar got to 84 % and then froze . Ten hours later it was still frozen . I couldn't exit out of the autoprogramming mode so I simply had to turn the tv off . When I turned the tv back on I could pick up 10 stations , all analog . I ran the autoprogramming again and it got stuck at 84 % completion again . This time I turned it off immediately and when I turned it back on I could pick about 40 stations . That still wasn't enough and besides , the digital stations were still missing . I ran it a third time and was only able to pick up 20 stations . It didn't matter how long I left the tv on when it got stuck at the 84 % mark . The number of stations the tv could pick up was totally random . I thought maybe it was my cable service but that tested out okay . Finally I thought I wonder what would happen if I turned the tv off before it got to the 84 % completion mark ? I started the autoprogramming , once again , and as soon as it got to 83 % I turned off the tv . I turned the tv back on and lo and behold all the stations were there , even the digital ones . I 'm thinking there 's a software error in the chip that runs the autoprogramming . When the autoprogramming reaches the 84 % mark it apparently gets stuck in an endless loop and is unable to complete the autoprogramming automatically .  
1	  The Epson 785 wastes gallons of ink when the ink cartridge nozzles dry out after a few days of disuse . Every cleaning cycle takes about 10 % of the cartridge capacity and it winds up costing a lot to print very little . The photos do come out nicely though but it better when you go through a cartridge every ten sessions . Do not buy .  
2	  I purchased this for my daughter in law , I love the color . She was very pleased  
1	  When I bought this camera in March I was excited for it . Drop proof , waterproof , crush resistant ? Sweet ! I 'm pretty tough on pretty much all of my stuff so I figured this would be the greatest camera ever , I was disappointed . i dropped it a couple of times on vacation , only from pants pocket height or table height and figured it would be ok , nope . It still took pictures , but as soon as I went back into the ocean it stopped working properly . The scene mode stopped and each time I want to go from looking at the pictures I have taken back to taking pictures , I have to restart the camera . Bottom line , if you are going to buy this camera , definately get the extended warrenty on it , chances are if you are at all near as rough on it as I was , it 's going to break .  
1	  I have to be honest that when i bought this device , i was excited having read so many great reviews . However , upon receiving it , I started using it and was very disappointed . The player is very slow connecting to your network , and then loses the connection every once in a while just for the heck of it . The user interface is somewhat confusing and is slow to respond to remote commands . Also , the little blue light on the front that indicates network transmission is a very bright blue , thats gets annoying after a few minutes . A piece of electrical tape to cover it is a must . I purchased this to take the place of my XBOX 360 's media playback functions . It was once I recieved this player that I realized just how good the XBOX 360 's media functions were . Save your money , and buy an XBOX 360 .. You wont be disappointed in the XBOX .  
2	  This VG800 LCD display is one sharp looking unit . It certainly has exceeded my expectations . This display is BRIGHT and has excellent contrast . Once I set it up , and tuned all of the parameters with the easy-to-follow instructions ( twice-just to make sure ) , it has performed perfectly . I have not noticed any video response problems viewing video clips , DVD movies , and even streaming video over the web displays just fine . I have used this product for over two months now , and am completely satisfied . I use spreadsheets , word processing , powerpoint , digital image viewing and editing , financial programs , lots of web surfing , some 3D gaming and writing reviews for products on AMAZON . COM :> ) and it is just great . The only performance drawback I have found is the rather useless and weak speakers . Just don't use them ! Also , if you let the ViewSonice control panel run in the background ( as it wants to do ) , it does have an annoying habit of always wanting to connect to the internet to " make adjustments " or some such nonsense . I just removed that program from the Windows ( R ) startup file and it still works just fine . If I need to fine tune , I can just start the ViewSonic control panel from the programs list . Easy enough , even for me . All I can say is , I 'm very happy with my VG800 and am going to get another one for my work computer as well . It also saves a lot of space on the desk and helps reduce that clutter - no big , bulky monitor hogging half the space on my desk . It is rather a lot of cash for a " monitor " , but is well worth the price , from my experience . Check out the technical specifications and industry recomendations , make your own judgement and decision . Regards and Toodles from the high desert , east of the sun and west of the moon .  
2	  i had bought headphones form shures before and have always been happy with what i have got . the se210 are no exception , thay sound so good when i music and i have watched some movies with them and they better then my 150 $ logitech speakers . I can forget they r ever there because they r so comfortable . if u have the money for them then u should buy them because they r the best . it was worth the $ 10/10  
2	  These headphones are used on my Macbook Pro and Ipod Nano . I work out with them , and wear them when I 'm walking to class at college . They don't have quite the bass response that I was hoping for , but the highs definitely scream , and they are excellent at blocking out outside noise . The cord is a little longer than the average headphone cord , but I usually have it going from a pocket in my jacket down to go up under my shirt and over my hears , so the cord isn't too bad . I 'd recommend them as a good all around earphone for a decent price , seeing how they are high-end earphones .  
1	  I decided to get the MX duo after reading all the good reviews here because I was looking for a nice wireless combo but after a few weeks it 's proven to be somewhat of a let down . Here 's the lowdown : Good :* The keyboard has a decent feel to it , and the mouse has no noticeable lag . * Rechargeable mouse battery * Some of the shortcut keys on the keyboard are nice . The only ones I use are the volume control and mute which are very nice to have at your fingertips . Bad :* All the other keyboard shortcuts which I never use . It makes the keyboard much bigger than I 'd need . I hardly ever listen to CDs , the controls for which take the entire top center of the keyboard . Then theres a bunch of other garbage like search , shopping , favorites , webcam , etc which I 've never touched . * There is no indicator light on the keyboard for when you have caps / numlock on which is VERY annoying . There are , however , indicators on the recharger but it 's way in the corner of my desk ( they say it should be kept 3 feet from all other electronic devices ) . Any place I put it still makes it exceptionally aggravating to have to look over to see if I 've accidently hit caps lock . Supposedly the software has some kind of indication that pops up on the screen , but I opted not to install the software because I didn't want all the stupid stuff they bundle with it . How hard is it just to keep the lights on the keyboard itself ? If it aint broken .. * The battery life for the mouse seems to be about 4-5 days . But the worst part is , unlike mice with cord chargers , you can't use the mouse while it 's charging because it 's sitting the in base station . So you 're SOL if your mouse dies while you 're working . Keep your old one handy if you buy this set . * I keep accidently hitting the " back " navigation button on the mouse which gets annoying too . It 's big and right where your thumb can accidently press it . * The mouse speed takes a while to get used to . Changing my mouse settings either makes it a little too fast or a little to slow . I give this product 2 stars . It has its virtues , but overall I think Logitech tried to make it " too cool " without considering the design consequences . Save yourself some aggravation and pick up a different set .  
1	  Faxes are received as bar codes . HP knows a problem exist with the formatter board but it took 4 calls to customer support for the problem to be acknowledged . To fix this under warranty HP wants to charge $ 50 for a refurbished copier sent overnight . I want the copier repaired at no cost at the local repair center but HP will not send the part . The part is backordered with " no estimate ship date " . I can buy the part as an end user for $ 193 . HP does not stand behind it 's products .  
2	  Very portable , pleasant appearance . Works great for my needs . Over-all very happy with this purchase .  
2	  Works perfectly . I use with my cable box , and occasionally some gaming consoles . They work great , no cut outs , no lag , no quality loss , they 're just as good as any other HDMI .  
2	  I use the Wacom for restoring hundreds of old photos . It makes the job easy and also adds an element of fun to this tedious task . I would strongly recommend this tablet to anyone interested in desktop publishing , photo or graphic editing .  
2	  I am very glad with this product . It is really very good & my laptop which used to get quite hot on the hard disk side is nice and cool due to the fan . It is very quite even on the high mode speed . The only irritating thing is the blue light which is very bright & can be used as a night light if needed :)  
1	  Mine crapped out , 1 year and two months . I purchased a Samsung to replace it . I will take out the speakers for ham radio use and put the rest of it out for bulk waste collection . I hope there is some future legal compensation for this .  
2	  We purchased a new camera about a month before we went on vacation so we would have time to get used to it before we left . We could have bought it the DAY we left , it is so user friendly ! The menus are easy to navigate , and set up is a breeze . We chose this camera based on 1 . anti-shake 2 . Size & overall ease of use 3 . Screen size . 4 . location and ease of pushing function buttons on camera ( husband 's man-sized fingers & my small fingers ) 5 . Bestshot features and video ability . This is the first camera we have owned without an optical viewfinder - we don't miss it . The screen is clear and bright , easy to see in sunshine . Before purchasing this camera , we also considered a couple of Canon models . Only thing that would make this camera more perfect would be a bit more zoom , but you can't have everything I guess . Love the red color , too . Pictures from the vacation and subsequent shots have turned out amazing ! We are very happy with the results . Battery life was terrific also . Some would recommend having an additional battery just in case , but we don't and didn't need one while the camera got heavy use on vacation ( 700 + pictures and video taken over 8 days ) . Just recharge in the dock at night , ready to go the next day . Very easy to slip in a purse or pocket , but not too lightweight for good " hand feel " . After the trip , my father couldn't stop talking about the camera to his friends . Infact , it impressed us and him so much , we bought one for Dad for Christmas , in a different color of course . We highly recommend this camera ! A great value for the price !  
1	  Bought the system , used it for three years , it worked fine . Then one day the HDD crapped out . I had purchased a second one to use at home , same model . Hooked it in , immediately said it didn't see the HDD . No response yet from SVAT . Have a feeling I 'm SOL . Company has too many negatives now , would never purchase from them again . Guess you get what you pay for . It is too bad that Amazon doesn't ban them from selling here .  
2	  This card is excellant ! Got 1 for my enVue and is just the right size of storage capasity for it . Will be ordering more to keep more albums without filling up my computer memory . I rate this as A-1  
2	  I bought this digital recorder to record my children and save it for posterity . It works great and the ability to transfer and save the recordings on my personal computer is outstanding . I would have given it five stars but for the relatively limited recording capacity .  
2	  I love this cooler pad . It has a low profile and a constant fan . It is quiet . I set it on my lap desk under my computer . It is lightweight and unobtrusive , but elevates the laptop by less than inch in front . If it saves my thermal pad from replacement ( it failed before I bought this product ) then I will be a happy girl .  
1	  I made sure I purchased the correct installation kit for the year / make / model of vehicle that we installed the new stereo system . It did not fit . There are gaps around the entire thing and we had to secure it temporarily until we can get a new one that fits correctly .  
2	  The brightness of the color made a huge difference ! I 've owned some model of the Palm Pilot since 1997 and only had frustration with the lack of brightness , NO PROBLEMS NOW ! I found a shareware application ( Fireviewer ) to carry my pictures , now they don't get ruined in my Wallet and I can carry many more family pictures now ! The MS Outlook syncronization makes this a great office / personal organizer ! I only want one more feature now , " usefull " wireless capability to make this the perfect gadget !  
1	  Everything that has been said about the sound is correct in the previous reviews . But I 'm surprised that more people don't complain about the excessive length of the one side of the ' V ' headphone ( where one side is much longer ) . It is literally so long that you could wrap it around a basketball . This makes it very cumbersome for use at the gym , running , etc , where it is always catching on stuff or getting in the way . It is the one glaring flaw that is causing me to sell these and go back to my other phones .  
1	  I have a WAP11 access point and WPC11 PC card . In a word , no range , no throughput and no customer service . Forget about 150 meters indoors , it drops off at about 10 meters , and that is line of sight ! At that point the signal strength goes down to about 30 % where it is unreliable . Even when the PC is 5 feet from the access point , throughput is at about 1MBPS instead of 11 ( even though the monitor claims its 11 ) . Moving away doesn't reduce the speed . It stays at 11 all the way until it just disconnects . I had hanging problems , but frankly , the product is so useless I haven't even used it enough to really give it a workout . Since it barely works outside of the room that contains the access point , I might as well just wire it up . Customer service ? I 've sent 2 emails that went unanswered . I 've called in and waited for an hour only to have someone take my name for a call back . They did call back ! Only it was 5 days later and I wasn't home . I waited on hold only to have someone pick up who sounded on his death bed . I only got 3 sentences out when he hung up on me . I could go on . I only got through to someone moderately helpful twice . Both suggested I buy an antennae , saying that it would of course void the warrantee . I am kicking myself for just assuming that the product really worked and letting my 30 day return period expire .  
2	  Anyone with a desk needs one of these . I use it to store important papers until I get time to file them ..  
1	  this is a cool mp3 player , so darn small , but it broke in half when i accidently dropped it ! it scraches so easily too . but wow , breaking in half ! make a tougher ipod next time , apple .  
1	  Great detail , etc .. Then the Ink clogs , the Ink blobs on the prints , etc .. Espon ? Ha they say end of lifeyea . Never again Epson .  
1	  We bought this TV a few years ago , and we were very happy with it . However , one morning it just stopped working . We don't watch a lot of TV so it has not had a lot of wear and tear . It should have lasted longer than it did .  
2	  I 'm usually very sketchy about buying 3rd party lenses , but this lens was an exception . After using this lens under low light conditions , I have to admit that this lens is VERY sharp in the center while the corners tend to be soft . I found some user opinions complaining about images not being sharp enough at wide open apertures . My other sharp primes ( 50mm f / 1.8 and 85mm f / 1.8 ) get softer and softer around the edges as the aperture is bigger and bigger . Same goes for this lens . In normal light conditions , this lens is as sharp as some of my best prime lenses . In low light conditions , I found image results to be sharp at f / 1.8 and beyond . Definitely a fast lens . The autofocus is a little funny , but overall , I find it very difficult to take this prime lens off my D80 . I highly recommend it !  
2	  CAMERA STYLE PHOTOS / VIDEO - WORKS GREAT , BUT BATTERY LIFE SEEMS TO BE SHORT . MAKE SURE YOU CUT THE CANCORDER OFF YOURSELF RATHER THAB WAITING FOR IT TO CUT IT 'S SELF OFF IS THE OLY ANSWER THAT I KNOW ..  
2	  This is an excellent unit . Philips makes excellent Compact Disc Recorders . The CDR775BK is a good unit . Unfortunately , you have to use 74-minute CD-R discs . 80-minute CD-R discs generally will not work . Once you read the manual and do some experimenting most of the other misconceptions about this exceptional unit should be cleared up . The unit has dual record and play trays so it is quite simple to make CD copies . It is important to note that if you wish to make copies from vinyl recordings your turntable must have a built-in pre-amplifier and you must patch this into the analog inputs otherwise , you will get very little signal strength and it will be virtually inaudible . My friend had that problem very problem . I had him use the phono-input ( phono-inputs pre-amplify the signal from the turntable ) to his receiver and then send the signal from the record-out on the back of the receiver into the analog inputs of the CDR775BK . That worked . You can also get a phono pre-amplifer and accomplish the same end . All in all this is a very good unit but you really have to read the manual .  
2	  I can connect my TV to my laptop easily with this cord ! The sound and picture are great . Also , I can keep my laptop close so I can easily change the video .  
2	  I bought this Olympus FE-180 camera to take pictures of a new home . I love it . 2 AlkalineBatteries last for 400 - 500 shots . I have 512k xd memory cards and it holds334 pictures . Easy to scroll through pictures and delete one if you want . I have sincebought one for my sister and my mother . They loved the pictures I took with mine and sickof theres killing the batteries after 40 shots or so . My mother dropped hers out of case fivefeet to a concrete floor and it still works fine . Small dent in front metal case . ( not Recommended ) This is my 4th digital camera and by far the best yet !  
1	  The product is so bad and I am extremely disappointed .. I went through many reviews and comparisons and bought this product . Satellite reception is the biggest problem and I experience the problem all the time . Some of my friends who bought the box at the same time also have similar issues .  
2	  everybody is right .. great pictures .. IS works .. macro to infinity all right-on clear .. now for secret stuff : 1 ) if you set it to manual , push func , scroll down to W , slide over to widescreen , take pictures in manual .. voila panaoramic picture one page 8X10 no stitching needed .. 2 ) . set mode to manual . push func-set .. scroll down to 0 . pushing 2 menu sets either 0 for exposure compensation or long shutter up to 15 seconds .. can you believe no one told us in either pro reviews or manual ?  
2	  This is the third time I 've ordered a ten pack of JVC MiniDV tapes , and they 've always worked great for me . The packaging is always a bit unique , as once I actually got a 10 pack , once 10 individually wrapped tapes , and this time I got three 3 packs and a single , but it still works ! This is also a great deal versus buying them individually at retail .  
2	  I was very pleased with the quality of the cables . It did take a little longer than I expected to receive them , but it was only a little over a week . The value is great ! WalMart wanted $ 26.00 for a cable of the same quality . You can't beat this deal !  
1	  This player looks good , plays well , an is in general well designed , but has one major problem . About 75 minutes through a movie the player will either reset , or pause without any means to restart other than start the movie over . This problem is with my player and my friends player ( as well as the other reviews ) . It has been in the shop twice for months with no improvements . I have heard that it may be a software problem , but I see no recall from Pioneer . For now , stay away !  
1	  I will go straight to the details as to why this unit sucks : The software called iTunes will frequently duplicate songs and waste space . The unit itself is prone to not being recognized by Windows XP , so there is frequently no sync available , so .. when sync is not available , you cannot upload new songs into your ipod . When plugging in your ipod , iTunes will tell you that the ipod needs to either re-enter all the songs , or reformat the whole ipod . When you " restore " your ipod ( according to the will of iTunes ) , nothing happens afterwards except an ipod with no songs in it .. and trying to put the songs back into the ipod .. i 'm still trying . Help ! Getting help ( help ! ) from iTunes is impossible , but I 'm still trying . Managing more than one ipod 's music in your pc is problematic and prone to glitches . I heard it 's easy to manage multiple ipods if you have a Mac . If you are still thinking of getting an mp3 player , the most trouble-free is the Creative Zen Microphoto ( 8gb ) , and the Sandisk Sansa Clip ( 2gb ) that holds 1000 songs . If you do decide on getting an ipod , make sure you save the music on cd 's ( burn them to cd ) .  
2	  Don't expect perfection but do expect a high quality conversion of hand-written text to usable professional correspondence and note-taking without too much correction required . I got 90-95 % accurate recognition of block writing off-the-bat and 80-85 % recognition of cursive writing . As with any conversion software it takes some practice to optimize one 's writing to get higher accuracy but not much-I didn't find myself having to relearn how to write to get the software to function with good results . Software installs quickly and without complication . I don't have the best penmanship in the world but with some minor effort to control my scrawl I was able to get an end product that I was happy with .. no matter what you use you 're going to have to do some editing / correcting to " finish " the product but so long as you don't expect perfection out of the box you 'll be happy for the price . Easily uploads to Word and email software .  
1	  I ordered one of these Tvs for my Niece from Tech for Less . It arrived with numerous electrical problems . There was no shipping damage , they shipped a defective TV and they knew it . Be VERY careful if you plan to purcahse anything from Tech for Less .  
1	  These radios do not work well . They do not transmit well unless you are on a flat plain area . We bought them for our cruise and could not communicate on the ship . Also , by the end of the trip , one of the radios had no display and won't turn off without taking out the batteries . I would not recommend these .  
1	  This is quite honestly the WORST piece of electronic equipment I have EVER owned . I have purchased two . The first was chewed up by my dog ( so not the fault of the charger . ) The second has HORRIBLE contact with the phone . I would plug in the phone and as it sat , totally unmoved on the floor / table , it would ring " charging " and then ring " uncharging " ( if that makes sense . ) Plus the optional detachments come apart and it is just extremely cheaply made . I bought mine from Target for about $ 15 and am really tempted to take it back-a total waste of time and $ .  
1	  I 'm writing this review after waiting on hold for Brother customer service-my 3rd call today-for more than 45 minutes . That is routine for calling there . We have tried ( and given up ) many times to call about our printer problems , but this is a business and there is a limit on how long we can stay on hold . The printer creates ghost images on envelopes , letterhead , labels and plain paper . It prints ghost images when the sheet feeder is used and when the paper feeder is used . All attempts to clean the printer according to Brother 's directions have not helped . Changing toner cartridges has not helped . The printer is pure junk . The warranty is a year , but not really . The drum is only guaranteed for 90 days , a very important thing to note-odds are , Brother will say your problem is due to the drum and will not exchange the printer . In our case , the problems with the printer started early . We were advised to try various other solutions first . Then , the attempts to reach Brother service started . We can't pay staff to be on hold . We can't drop our own customer service to continue holding for a tech support person at a company offering poor customer service . By the time I finally got through to Brother today , my purchase was slightly over 90 days . We had a trouble-free small HP laser printer for years . I regret going for a good deal and buying in this one . I will probably end up buying another brand of printer and just dumping this one & calling it a big mistake . One other problem buyers should be aware of-the electrical draw of this printer seems to be unusually high . When it prints , the lights in this office dim and flicker-granted this is 1980 's electrical wriing , but our other printers don't do this .  
2	  Very good for the price . Needs a bit of EQ , but overall , a really excellent buy . Replacing a broken set .  
1	  I 'm frustrated with Visioneer 's lack of quality testing of their software installation . They bill themselves as easy to use and install . I just utilized their " tradeup " program since their older 7620 model does not operate with Windows XP or Windows 2000 ( a travesty in and of itself ) . They gave me a 25 % discount to trade up to the 9020 . Just tried to install but it indicates a dll is missing . I 've now spent an hour attempting to find and install the missing dll . A visit to their website is now rivaling Microsoft 's in it 's complexity troubleshooting-an only offers M-F support . This is unconscionable for a major supplier of scanners .  
1	  I bought this card to put in an existing PC , but the PC has PCI version 2.1 . I could not get it to work . The computer wouldn't even boot up when the card was in , and I tried this in two very different computers . Same thing happened . Finally , after much online research , I discovered that the computer must support PCI version 2.2 and above . Since I waited to install it , I cannot return it now so I 'm stuck with an unusable card .  
1	  My 250GB Western Digital hard drive died after only a month & took with it over 150GB worth of data that wasn't backed up anywhere else ( for obvious reasons - who really " backs up " their backup drive anyway ? ) . At first the drive worked very well : it supported plug-and-play , had a large amount of space , was competitively priced and was made by WD , a brand I thought to be trustworthy . However , a company who boasts for you to " Put Your Life On It " ( their external hard drives ) should at least try to ensure data reliability & take accountability for their products . When I called customer service about my failed drive I obtained this list of information : 1 . If you wish to recover your data , you must use one of their partners or risk voiding your warranty . There are only 8 in North America . 2 . You are responsible for the cost incurred in using their data recovery partners . 3 . Western Digital doesn't issue any refunds . If you purchased your drive from a store such as BestBuy you could return your faulty product . However , at online retailers such as Buy . com you are left without options . 4 . You can obtain a replacement drive ( what they call re-certified ) but it 'll be devoid of your precious data . 5 . You are responsible for the shipping costs associated with returning the faulty drive back to WD . They pay for shipping of the replacement drive to you . This is apparently called " fair shipping " . 6 . According to the CSR , Western Digital is not responsible for your data . They are only a supplier of hard drives . 7 . On a different note , the CSR never actually apologized for my failed drive but only used words such as " unfortunate " and " let 's explore your options " . In summary , this product is fine if you happen to receive a unit that doesn't fail . However , I would not be willing to take that risk and I don't recommend anyone buying this product for any amount of money . It 's acceptable that a device such as this is prone to failure . However , Western Digital 's " it 's not my problem " attitude is not .  
1	  They are nice to keep things organized . Not a big deal , but collects dust so you have to keep up with it . I dont .  
2	  For those that don't wish to be tied down ( pun intended ) to running in Nike shoes , this Marware Nike iPod Sport sensor holder does exactly what 's meant to do . Once you 've got the holder in place on your sneaker , you never need worry about again . Lacing your shoes on and off is unaffected - it 's the perfect product in that you forget you even have it .  
1	  I can't get earbuds to stay in my ears , so a few years ago I got some over the ear headphones that sit in your ear like earbuds-style . I really liked them , but so did my dog as it turned out , and she chewed them into tiny pieces . Since I knew that I like the style and fit , I thought I would be quite happy with the Sony MDR-J10 as a replacement pair . I don't really care about bass or midrange or treble or anything like that while I 'm working out , so $ 10 is the right price range for me . When I plugged them in to my ipod , though , I found that there was something wrong . Even a slight movement of the wire where it connects to the plug causes static and interference . No protective case in the way holding the plug out or anything like that . I figured it was the one lemon in the bunch . I know Amazon has a great return policy , so I sent them back and got a replacement pair of the the same model . Exact same problem . It wouldn't be much of an issue with stereo-type headphones that aren't going to get jostled too much , but for active headphones ? That 's a dealbreaker .  
1	  After assembling my turntable I pushed play and the platter spun around , went in reverse and then stopped . I turned it off and let it sit for an hour and it still wont start . Very disappointed in Numark . I want my $ 184 back .  
2	  About 2 months ago I bought a new Harmony 880 remote . This is the third Harmony remote I have owned . I purchased my first Harmony remote about 5 years ago because I hated having 5 individual remotes for my home theater system . My first Harmony remote , a model 659 , was flaky from the beginning . I had trouble loading the program into it , and it would stop working when I changed the batteries . I found heating it with a hair dryer would fix it . I got about 3 years use out of it before it stopped working competely . Hoping the first one was a lemon , I got a second Harmony remote , also a model 659 , and it worked perfectly for 2 years and then quit . I decided to try the model 880 this time so I would not have to change batteries every 3 months . So far it works perfectly . Without the Harmony remote my home theater system is unmanageable . If there is another good alternative I have not found it . The on line data base is very complete , I have never had to learn a command from the remotes that came with each component . If you buy a harmony remote you have to spend about an hour or so programming it to use your components to do what you want them to do . If you get a new component you can update the remote easily .  
1	  CD Projects used to make some of the best quality disc storage units available . I 've used one of their Roladisc CD holders ( like a rolodex which holds CD sleeves ) for at least five years-I 'm pushing it to its full capacity ( over 100 sleeves , most holding two discs back-to-back ) , and it 's still in great shape . Unfortunately , within the past year or two , CD Projects has changed hands . It shows : the commitment to quality is no longer there . CD Projects pioneered the use of special materials in their sleeves which help protect discs-a practice which , fortunately , is being imitated . But newer products from CD Projects ( i.e. those manufactured after the shakeup ) use sleeves of much lesser quality . I 'll grant that the new sleeves are still better than many offered by the competition , but they 're harder to use ( the discs don't slide in and out as easily ) and less protective . Also , the CD Projects product line has been reduced significantly . Not much selection anymore . For those disappointed that the CD Projects name no longer represents the best , I suggest looking into the Univenture catalog , particularly Unikeep binders . A bit pricey , but it 's now become the best choice .  
1	  This item doesn't work clear . I used in my car its sound is not clear . This item doesn't have the same effect as regular car stereo . I wouldn't recomend this item to any buyers .  
2	  Wow ! Got this camera just before my Hawaii vacation . Although I still haven't finished all the instruction , I did learn enough to take fantastic pictures in all kinds of different lighting . Time exposures at night were superb . High resolution results with the SLR camera cannot compare to digital instamatics with those tiny lens aperatures . Recommend this for any enthusiast who lkie to control their on settings .  
2	  This pool is so easy to set up ! And the pump really keeps the pool clean ! I cant believe what a great purchase this has been . I try to find time every day to enjoy this pool ! I have already decided to purchase the next size up for next summer ! This pool is totally worth the money ! You do still need to buy a little chlorine float as well as a skimmer but it was still a fantastic purchase for the price !  
2	  Excellent device .. I use it to remote view my security camera 's about 140-150 feet .. It is connected to the PC port of a regular 32in flat screen TV . The colors are not exactly like the direct connected monitor but it is what I expected for a VGA video signal . Highly recommended ..  
2	  Bought thisTRENDnet 108Mbps Wireless Super G USB Adapter ( TEW-444UB Version V1.1R ) last fall during a Gold Box Deal , and it has served its purpose a number of times . Have been using it as a general purpose backup for notebook PCs and as test device for wireless installations , mostly where the OS is Windows 2000 / XP ( SP1 / SP2 ) , 2003 Server , or Vista . Linux is not a supported operating system , but the listed chipset for the TEW-444UB is ' Atheros AR5523 + AR2112 ' , so there may be 3rd-party Linux drivers available if one looked . This reviewer found excellent wireless connectivity with 802.11g or 802.11b networks , and also found it to be backward compatible . Was able to reach the listed 108Mbps speed under certain installations , but do remember that speed performance and coverage may vary depending on an individual network environment . If you get one of these wireless adapters , be sure to check under the white section of the packaging , where you 'll find an excellent 5-foot USB 2.0 cable . This isn't noted in the specs , and happens to be an excellent USB 2.0 extension cable . A friend got one of these and almost threw the box away without checking under the white cardboard section . Should you need longer , then thisTRENDnet USB Extender Cable ( 5m , 16.4ft ; ( male to female ) should do the job . It 's highly suggested that after you install the drivers form the included CD-ROM disc , you go to the TRENDnet Website ( see comments ) and check for any updated drivers . Installation of updated drivers will often eliminate those annoying networking issues that can ( and will ) sometimes occur . Should you need speeds higher than the 108Mbps offered , theTRENDnet 300Mbps Wireless N USB Adapter ( TEW-624UB Version 1.0R ) should fit those needs , and it works with Mac OS X v10.4 and above , which isn't supported by the modelo reviewed here . Though Vista is not listed as a recognized OS for this device , it actually is supported , and the appropriate drivers for the TEW-444UB are available for download from the TRENDnet Website ( see comments ) . The steps for installation under Windows Vista are as follows : Step 1 : On the bottom right-hand corner of the screen , right click the wireless network connection icon and select ' Connect to a network ' . Step 2 : Select the desired network and then click ' Connect ' . Step 3 : Enter the security key and then click ' Connect ' . Note : If you 're connecting to an unsecured network , click ' Connect Anyway ' . Step 4 : Click ' Close ' . Summary .. General performance : 4-stars ; functions as expectedConnectivity : 5-stars ; no issues foundInstallation : 5-stars ; very easyOverall : 5-stars ; excellent value for the money , especially if you find it at a reduced price . Adding to the value is that five-foot USB 2.0 cable that one will find under the divider . Recommended .  
1	  On the positive side , it is an attractive unit . In the negative side , it will not directly record unless you use the " + " format . Unfortunately this is not compatible with many DVD players . In other words , buyer beware .  
1	  This board is described as a Micro ATX but is actually a micro BTX . Be aware of this - if you do not have a Micro BTX case - the board will not fit .  
2	  It is so easy to use and handy ! I like how easy it was to upload the videos . The only complaint I have is that it immediately uploads to the software , I wish it was quicker to get it into the software I want to use . But that part was not completely difficult when figured out . I will be getting one for my sister when she has a baby ..  
1	  I spent over 4 hours trying to install this product , to no avail . I am knowledgable about networking ( an amateur , but I know what I am doing ) and simply could not get this to work . The documentation , which you WILL need , is insufficient and the setup is extremely complicated . If you download the most recent firmware and admin software from Hawking 's site , you will get a wizard which seems very good . According to the wizard , everything was fine . The only problem is that my printer , a Konica Minolta PagePro 1350W , would not print a page , period . I wonder if the printer is simply incompatible . Bottom line is that this product is not ready for prime time . PC World magazine rated this print server as an Editor 's Choice , which is why I bought it . DO NOT BE FOOLED . You are rolling the dice here . Some people have been able to get it to work , and I imagine it 's a real boon for them ( it would have been for me ) , but you are taking a risk . So please be aware of that before you buy this product . If you are a pro with lots of time on your hands ( which I imagine the people at PC Magazine are ) , maybe you should give this a shot but otherwise it 's too big a risk of wasting your time . I suspect there is a reason this print server is so much cheaper than those of the competition ( I got mine for around $ 90 , a lot of comparable ones are $ 140 or so ) .  
1	  And save money . I bought exactly the same Viking from Amazon . com one year ago , it worked flawlessly for about ten months , now I can take some pictures , but not all are read by USB card reader or even the camera itself . Reformatting didn't help . Have 256 meg SanDisk card - no issues so far , athough initially I bought it just because it was cheaper .  
1	  My friend ordered this kit when I helped him with an amp install . I am a KnuKonceptz guy and was worried when he told me he had bought a Boss kit . My worries were later validated . When I got my hands on the wire I was horrified at how little conductor there is . Radioshack 's 10 gauge is thicker than this . The speaker wire is very meh and also very little conductor . The fuseholder is decent , that 's the only way it could ever deserve a star . STAY AWAY fro this kit if you want an 8 gauge kit . [ .. ] and their ebay store has quality wire and install stuff for reasonable prices . I 've seen so much evidence of Boss 's bad quality I don't think I would ever even consider touching a product of theirs . Hope this helps .  
1	  When I first subscribed to SBC / Yahoo DSL , this was the modem that shipped with it . I was connected at 100 Mbps , but was only surfacing a download speed that maxed out at just above 20 KB / s . I checked my computer for anything that would slow it down , but nothing . I called AT & T and they said the ping was fine and modems don't affect speed . I recently changed over to the Motorola SB5120 Surfboard Modem , and my download speed spiked to about 300 KB / s . Same thing with my friend except even lower speeds .  
2	  This GPS system has all the critical functionality of more expensive GPS systems : - text-to-voice - bluetooth - MP3 player - great database of POIOne of the most convienent functions of this GPS , is the bluetooth connection . The entire address book on your cell phone is uploaded to the GPS system and the phone can be fully run through the touch-screen . The sound quality of the GPS is excellent as well . I have had the GPS for over 3 weeks now and I have no negative comments to make on this unit .  
1	  The red and black wire that are advertised as 8gage are not really 8 gage . Do not use this with a 1000 watt amp unless you want your car to catch fire .  
1	  I never received it ! When I try to track it it was delivered , but nobody has it and it was supposedly delivered 3 weeks after it shipped . Records say they shipped to wrong address . I don't know who has it but I sure don't . I won't order from amazon again .  
2	  I have been using this bluetooth keyboard for about one week on my new Apple Mac Mini and like this product very much . The keys are the scissor type and feel solid and responsive when pressed . Keyboard is solidly built with smooth hard plastic and looks like an Apple product in quality and appearance . Connected wirelessly to my Apple computer with no problems at all . The keyboard has never lost connection with the computer . The keyboard is screwed together with metal screws on the back and the fit and finish of the parts are excellent . The back of the keyboard has a paring button and an on / off sling switch . The keyboard takes two AA batteries that are included in the product package . At the top of the numeric keypad are buttons for up / down volume , mute , and and DVD eject . It has caps / lock , paring , and battery low led light above the numeric keypad . Also , back of the keyboard has flip out feet to adjust the angle of the keyboard . I just wish Macally offered the same keyboard without the numeric keypad to save space on my desk , however , the keyboard is slightly smaller than I expected but with full sized keyboard . I think this keyboard is more comfortable to use than the apple keyboard . I use the keyboard with the Targus Bluetooth Mouse that I also purchased on Amazon for just $ 17 ( mouse is also excellent ) . Why spend a premium for an Apple keyboard ?  
2	  Just got the TV yesterday after about a year of researching . The black levels are better than any other LCD that I 've seen . The game mode is breath taking when playing PS2 or PS3 or any console . I also hooked it up to my computer using a Nvidia 6800 with the latest drivers .. heaven . Now I am on my couch checking my emails and browsing all at the same time . I haven't tried computer gaming on this monster , but i will update this comment or post new ones for future buyers . You can't go wrong with this choice . U got 95 % of the Sony quality without 1000 to 1500 extra bucks . Buying here also saved my $ 800 + free shipping and handling . Awesome deal .  
2	  Works great , and has a good range . Mounts nicely to the steering wheel and is easy to navigate . The only issue I have had is the retaining clip not wanting to hold the remote in very strongly so it occasionally pops out .  
1	  it does not fit in my old toshiba laptop or my current hp pavilion dv6  
1	  I 'm a ridiculous headphone snob , so I don't live with headphones / earphones that don't meet up to my standards . And these don't live up to my standards . The sound is okay , but the biggest problem is that they don't fit very well in the ear . You can push them right up against the ear canal , but leaving them there for more than five minutes caused my ears to hurt like crazy . Then I push them back on my ear , but then I lose ALL bass response . So , back to the store they go . Trust me , if your ears are sensitive to pressure , these headphones will kill your ears to the point where it 's uncomfortable to wear them even more than an hour .  
1	  I have the iGo Juice ^ 70 model PS0055 . This is a three-in-one adapter - AC , vehicle , airplane - that can power and charge your notebook computer . With an optional accessory , you can also charge another mobile electronics device , such as an MP3 player , a cell phone , or a PDA . In other words , the Juice can charge at most two devices : a notebook , plus one other small gadget . Unlike what some other reviews have said , the Juice cannot power / charge more than two things at a time . The Juice comes with 10 tips for a variety of notebook computer brands , from Compaq and HP to Fujitsu to Panasonic . Unfortunately and unforgiveably , no tips is included for the popular Sony and Toshiba notebooks . You can call iGo to request a free Sony - or Toshiba-compatible tip ; whether they 'll actually mail it to you is something I can't verify . ( There doesn't seem to be a way to make the request on their website . ) In addition to the heavy brick-style power converter / transformer ( " adapter " ) , you get an AC cord , a vehicle / airplane combination cord , and a notebook input cord . Let me explain . The AC cord and the auto / air cord bring source power to the Juice brick ; i.e. , you plug one of them into the approriate power outlet and also into the Juice brick . The notebook input cord then goes from the Juice to your notebook , with the correct power tip attached . Be sure to use the correct tip ! Not only is it a question of size and fit , but also polarity and probably also voltage control . Unfortunately , iGo 's tips are poorly made and there are many reports of poor fits . ( Everything in the package is made in China . ) ( Tip : even though the Juice comes with an insert of notebook compatibility charts , be sure to go to the iGo website for updated and correct compatibility check ! The charts have a number of mistakes . For example , it says my Fujitsu C2210 notebook should use Tip 11 , whereas in reality it 's Tip 3 that will work , something that 's correctly stated on the iGo website . ) On the notebook input cord is a connection point for an optional secondary powering system . You can buy one of these on iGo 's website for about $ 30 . With this and an appropriate tip ( another $ 10 , not included in the secondary system ) , you get a secondary adapter , i.e. , an adapter for the Juice adapter ! This secondary adapter then allows you to charge / power your cell phone or PDA or MP3 , one at a time , each with its own corresponding tip . For example , if I were to get a tip for my Sanyo SCP-8100 cell phone , I 'd have to buy an A02 tip , in addition to the secondary system ( which is called " DualPower Accessory for Mobile Electronic Devices " on iGo 's website ) . OK , the Juice works as advertised . It can get hot during operation . My gripe regarding its design is it 's rather bulky , like a brick , and a bit heavy at 7 oz . without the cords . The traveling weight - the brick plus the three cords - weigh at least a whole pound . iGo does give you a cheaply made pouch to store them . Now , if you get the secondary power system in order to charge / power another gadget , the secondary adapter will weigh at least 4 or 5 oz . , excluding its own power cord ! Again : out of box the Juice cannot power any cell phones , PDAs or MP3 players . You must purchase an additional secondary adapter and the right power tips . I simply cannot how some reviewers lied about or omitted this important hard fact about the Juice . My biggest gripe is how expensive this whole thing is . I paid over $ 100 for the Juice and the special tip for my Sharp Actius MM20 ultralight notebook . Then I found out in order to power my Sanyo cell phone or my HP iPaq Pocket PC PDA , I 'd have to buy a secondary adapter plus one tip for each ! The additional costs , and weights , can add up quickly . Not to mention the headaches of managing all the power tips . Let me say this : I regret my purchase of the iGo Juice . The small AC adapter that came with my Sharp Actius MM20 weighs a mere 2 oz . The AC adapter for my Sanyo phone is a mere 1 oz . Together they take up far less space and weigh far less than the Juice brick alone , not to mention I don't even have a secondary iGo adapter yet . Nor do I plan to buy one . ( So right now I can only charge one notebook at a time . I still need to carry the Sanyo and iPaq adapters . ) My advice : don't waste your money , seriously . If you need a vehicle adapter , get a cheap one from Radio Shack or direct from your otebook manufacturer . The airplane plug in the Juice package is useless as most modern airplanes accommodate regular power plugs . The Juice package , for its high price , doesn't even include world outlet adapters , so you can only use the AC cord in the U.S.A very poor value IMHO .  
1	  A while ago I purchased the same item , maybe a month , and I received what I paid for : 2 walkie talkies , 2 RECHARGABLE BATTERIES , and a CHARGING BASE for the walkies . In this last purchase I thought I bought the same things , I even paid the same amount of money , but neither the batteries nor the charging came in the package . Thank youHumberto GonzalezSan Jose , Costa Rica  
2	  What can I say ? This prodcut worked perfectly upon install . With RAM , it usually either works or not . I love the price on this product . This is the least expensive price I 've found in a couple of years . I didn't feel so great about the packaging unfortunately . Each peiece was wrapped in a thick paper towel and then placed in a small bubble envelope . I guess that 's fine since it arrived in one peice .  
1	  In March 2012 I purchased a classic 80gb ipod from this seller . I received the ipod in the beginning of March 2012 , and after using the ipod about 5 times the ipod froze and a big red X appeared on May 15 , 20012 ( only about 2 months of having the ipod ) . I immediately went onto apple 's website and followed the instructions to fix it . Unfortunately the red X still appeared . So I took my ipod to a ipod repair shop and I was told by them and apple that the hard drive was bad and the harddrive for this ipod is $ 99.00 plus labor for installing the hard drive . I am very upset and feel ripped off because I paid $ 119.00 for an ipod from this seller , only had it for 2 months and used it 5 times . I contacted the seller about 13 days ago and seller has not responded . I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN . I have purchased tons of items from amazon 's website and this is the 1st bad review haven't had to write .  
1	  At first , I was thrilled to find an mp3 player for the RCA Lyra 's price and capacity , and it worked great when I began using it . However , only a few weeks afterwards , almost all of the songs began to skip , and about a month after that , I had difficulty just trying to turn it on ! Now , just FIVE MONTHS after buying it , the harddrive has completely crashed ! Now I can't use this player at all , and I 've lost $ 150 ! Apparently , I am NOT the only one who has suffered these problems , as most everyone who has held onto this player for an extended period of time has been confronted with harddrive problems . My advice : STAY CLEAR ! While it 's a good bargain , you 'll end up wasting your time and ( if you didn't fill out the warranty info , like me . ) your money .  
1	  This is not a Canon product - despite what the photo looks like or how the product is described . It 's a compatible ink cartridge .  
1	  This case is too Big for the W1 camera . The camera keeps on moving inside the case . I dunno why it is advertized for the W1 model ! I think if you have TWO ( or maybe 3 ) W1 cameras , this case will be a good choice ;) I guess this case was intended for ealier and bigger sony cameras . I gave this case 2/5 because it is actually a nice case ( for other sony models ) , it can fit all ur extra batteries & memory sticks and it is made of good materials .  
1	  This eyepiece doesn't work on all EOS Cameras . I purchased this for my EOS Rebel XS and it doesn't fit due to the camera 's body shape . Will NOT RECOMMEND TO BUY unless the back of your EOS has a completely flat space around the eyepiece .  
1	  I purchased this unit at Wal-Mart about 2 months ago for $ 198.99 . Within weeks the price dropped to $ 148.99 . No problem here because I thought a 6-head VCR would provide better picture and sound quality than the standard 4-head so the price was right for me . Within the past week the VCR has been sluggish when it comes to putting in and taking out videos . I didn't think anything of it until I put in a video to copy it to DVD and it wouldn't eject . All I heard was a continual ticking sound whenever I tried to play it , rewind it or press the " Eject " button . The next day without any rhyme or reason , I was able to play and eject the video . I removed it from the unit , put it in to record the following day and the VCR ate it again . The ticking sound started and nothing happened when I tried to play , rewind or press " Eject " ( again ) . Wal-Mart will not accept the unit back . They tell me to call the manufacturer ( RCA ) - which I did . They want me to incur a pricey shipping cost to send it back and can't guarantee that they can fix the problem . PLUS , they tell me that the video is not returnable when / if they are able to get it out . So , in a nutshell , the video remains stuck in the unit so the VCR is unusable . Thankfully I have a backup that I run through AV2 for recording and playing . Also , on some videos there is a continual humming noise when they are played back . No amount of tracking or adjusting will clear it . It 's annoying to hear that all through a film . Bottom line - don't waste you money on this unit . The VCR portion is notorious for eating tapes and the humming problem is pretty common from what I 've read over the past few days . Buyer beware . :-( * Well .. I 'm adding on to my original review of April 2008 . Not only did this unit " eat " my video ( which I was never able to get out of the VCR ) , but now the unit " ate " my DVD . I had to dismantle the unit and pry open the DVD holder to get the disc out . This problem came out of the blue . I was recording from TV and could not eject the disc . " Hello " continually scrolled across the display and the unit would not recognize any of the commands from the remote control . I left the unit unplugged for over an hour thinking that would reset the system ( according the the user manual ) but it did not . I tried this three times . Unable to get the disc to eject , I finally decided to take the unit apart and get it out myself . Still , I could not get either the VCR or the DVD portion to accept or eject anything . So , after having the unit for only about 4 months I finally had to throw it away . It was going to cost more money than it was worth to return it to the manufacturer and there were no guarantees that it would work properly once I got it back . Basically , it was a $ 200 piece of worthless crap ! Never again , RCA . I replaced it with a Magnavox DVD recorder for about half the price . The only disappointment I had with this whole experience is that the RCA was pretty easy to install and use and I became pretty proficient at navigating through the system and could easily copy VHS to DVD in practically no time at all . The new Magnavox is a bit more confusing and requires a bit more time for things like disc labeling and finalzing . I got spoiled with the RCA but not enough so that I 'd ever purchase another one . Let 's hope I have better luck with my Magnavox .  
2	  I wish I had gotten this for less at Amazon , however I purchased this antennae for my sister as her entry into the world of HDTV with her RCA DTA800B Converter box hooked up to a twenty year old RCA Console TV . My sister said she wanted something simple she didn't have to monkey with and this little baby fit the bill . In her walk out basement apartment she has a window that is aimed at the Twin Cities , MN antennae farm . Once I set this antennae on the window side of her dresser ( still 8 feet from the window ) she gets perfect reception all channels ( 2-1 & 2,4-1,5-1 & 2,9-1 & 2,11-1 & 2 , 17-1-5 , 23-1 & 2,29-1 & 2 , and 45-1 ( zip code 55436 ) . Works great and great reception . Everyone looking at digital TV needs to remember brick , steel , conduits , and house ducts are the enemy of any digital TV reception . Outdoors is best , a window is second .  
2	  Easy to install ; easy to use ; recordings are just as good as originals ; record DVD to DVD , VHS to DVD , DVD to VHS  
1	  I was a loyal Ritek user for some time . I bought these exact discs in May of this year and burned them on a number of drives . Scans at the time showed very low error levels . This weekend I rescanned and ALL the discs had increases in error levels of over 1000 % , many were barely readable . Draw your oown conclusions .  
2	  I 'm glad I got the iFreePlay ; I use it to listen to podcasts and audio books as I ride my recumbent bicycle . The sound is quite acceptable for this . As for the headphones falling down , they don't if you loop them over your ears as I expect they were designed to be worn . A good solution for those of us not affording bluetooth and a salvation against swearing when the cords of other headphones / earbuds tangle . And you know they will ! > )  
1	  After 4 months I got " Err 2 " on my Rebel XT . I was able to get the pictures off the card , but now neither my PC or camera even recognizes that there is a card loaded . I 'm going to try to work with San Disk to replace it . Wish me luck .  
1	  I bought this to use with a 170-500 f5.0-6.3 sigma with my D80 / D300 Nikons . Even though I new that I was buying a cheap product , I didn't know that this would be so bad .. Even with clear Southern California skies , I couldn't get a reasonable picture ..  
1	  My Ipod stopped working and was unable to reset it . I had to go to Apple for repair . Worst buy ever ..  
1	  This is our second Presto " percolator " in the past year . They both broke shortly after the return period expired . Great , hot coffee . While it lasted .  
1	  i bought this item , listed as " new " from " shopcell " . what arrived in the mail could hardly be described that way . i received an fm transmitter that was not in any sort of manufacturers packaging ( unless thats how you describe a ziplock baggie ) and came with " instructions " that appeared to have been xeroxed multiple times over . i have no way of telling if this item is actually new , refurbished or just used . there doesnt appear to be any cosmetic damage , and have yet to see if it even works properly . price aside , this was a most frustrating purchase . i guess you do get what you pay for . i use amazon less than some other online retailers but really thought they did a good job of managing their sellers . maybe i was mistaken .  
2	  There might be better words to call the sound they produce but ill call it spatial sounding . Its really different from what im used to , more direct placement sounding speakers . But for my personal application where its located in a nook only 1 foot from the rear wall and 1 " away from the side walls its as good as it gets . Soundstage is huge for its placement and it fills the room nicely . Due to its lack of bass it suits my needs best as most speakers tend to get muddy in its location in a hurry . The speaker seems to be crafted really well and its coating is gorgeous and suits my kitchen well , it looks way more pricey than it is . Amplifier matching is not simple with this beauty , i have tried several amps on them in its current placement and what works best for me was a Naim Uniqute in 2 channel mode . If this was in a surround setting using all mirage omd range it would be great as well , i know i tried it was pretty fun for the movies . Ive been messing around with speakers and amps for nearly a year now trying to figure out what sounds best here and even though this might not be the best it suits my family needs perfectly . Amps that i have tried and replaced Primaluna 1 , peachtree audio idecco and Manley itube . Speakers that came and went B & W ; 683 , Martin Logan source and Sonus Faber Liuto bookshelf . WOuld i use this in a real 2 channel setup given i had the space probably not , but the fault would not lie in how it sounds is that i am not use to the sound it produces , as in everything its all very personal . I gave this a four star rating based on a 2 channel system , but if it was on a surround for the price its a definite 5 .  
2	  I have been searching for a turntable for almost 3 years , on and off . Until recently , I was not happy enough with the over all quality for the dollars spent on the available products . I considered the popular ' hi-fi ' units like Music Hall , Rega and Pro-Ject , as well as units like the Technics SL1200MKII ( and upgrading the arm ) . I must admit , the Technics really is superior to the other entry level price units , by leaps and bounds , so far as engineering / quality / build is concerned , even if the tonearm is a bit dated . If I was going to buy a $ 500 range table , the Technics would be the only logical choice . But I decided to considerably increase my budget range to about $ 2000 USD range , as I wanted to buy my final turntable , not waste money buying something I would want to later upgrade . When I came across the Marantz , I was initially mesmerized by it 's beauty . Then I took a closer look . Arm : It uses the ClearAudio Satisfy Aluminum arm , which is a $ 1200 arm by itself , and appears to be rather superior by a large degree , compared to the Rega RB300 ( or even RB700 ) and arms used on most other turntables in the under $ 2000 price range . The Satisfy seems to be extremely stiff , and has a dead locked stability with no twist whatsoever . The friction is extremely low ( much lower than is usual ) thanks to the polished sapphire bearing on tungsten points ( 3-5x lower static friction than standard metal on metal polished and hardened bearings , based on what I could find in research ) . The fact that virtually every part of the tone arm was precision machined is also impressive , as far as a cosmetic standpoint . The magnetic anti-skate is very good , and if you are one that does not like anti-skate at all , you are in luck , as it can be removed by simply unscrewing and taking off the large set screw on the right hand side that contains the anti-force magnet . The hydraulic damper is among the smoothest I have used . I was not impressed at all by the arms on the Rega , Music Hall and Pro-Ject turntables . I have noticed one or two people online complain that the Satisfy has a non optimal design , in regards to the angle of the vertical bearing in relation to the headshell angle . This is true - ideally - the bearing would be at the same angle . Because it is not , when the vertical position changes ( like on a record warp ) , the vertical ( azimuth ) will be changed dynamically . I investigated this , and aligned my azimuth as close as possible using a right angle to the cartridge / stylus . I then observed the degrees of error over the distance that a severe warp would move the arm , vertically . Well , theory is nice , but it 's not realized in practice here . The amount of error that occurred was less than the degree of accuracy I could ever begin to align the azimuth to begin with . That is , the apparent degree of dynamic azimuth error due to the bearing angle was less then the error of my best attempt at azimuth alignment . Even if I used more precise azimuth setting ( using for example , a macro lens on a live view camera with reference squares on the view screen ) , I can't see how you can be sure the actual stylus tip is even lined up perfectly with the cantilever ( which is your best reference point ) . Anyways , many arms have this so-called ' problem ' present that I can not discern is a real problem . Besides , my turn table passes the Ultimate Test Analog LP record with flying colors after my careful set up procedures . The arm seems to be a near perfect transparent device , overall ; it was a major selling point of this turntable for me . The arm mounts directly into the table with a single set screw to hold it ( and adjust VTA ) . The arm also comes with the separate mounting plate hardware to mount the arm in another table if you so desire . A very good inclusion , IMO , if one wants to change tables but keep the superb arm in the change . Table chassis : The table itself is air craft grade acrylic that has been machined to shape . It is roughly 0.75 " thick . The table chassis is slightly resonant . When you tap on it quickly , you can hear a slight emphasis and resonant response . It is , however , far less resonant than the standard painted MDF chassis used by most manufacturers . The surface appears to have been bead blasted , giving a fine satin appearance / feel . The unit has solid , large diamater aluminum feet which are polished . Very attractive , but there is no suspension on this turntable - so you must consider this for your application ( s ) . I use a de-coupled board / plinth to sit the turntable upon . Platter : The turning platter weighs approximately 5 lbs , and is 1.2 " thick . It is made of silicone infused acrylic . It is very dense . It is unusually inert . Tapping on the structure reveals a very low level ' tick ' sound ( simply your fingernail tapping the solid structure ) with absolutely no noticeable decay / resonance . This is a fine platter , IMO . It is precisely machined and has no visible irregularities when spinning , unlike some other platters on other turntables . Platter Bearing : It uses an inverted thrust bearing with a hardened metal alloy resting on a single bearing made of some kind of ceramic or jewel ( I am not sure ) , but it is very hard and smooth / polished . The hardened metal shaft rests against a metal side bushing to stabilize it vertically . The well the bearing sits within under the table is made from machined aluminum and is sealed against the bottom of the acrylic base with a silicone gasket . A bit of grease is dabbed in , it appeared , and the table came with bearing oil that is suggested ( by the manual ) to be used once every few years . I actually went ahead and dumped in a bit to fill up the well enough to give the bearing and point a constant oil bath . If you spin the platter free ( without the belt on it ) on a level surface , it will continue to spin for 1-2 minutes ( depending on how hard of a spin you gave it ) and is completely silent from a normal perspective . If you rest your ear against the table firmly , you can hear a slight constant friction sound - but it 's incredibly low in level . Superb bearing is the conclusion . Motor : The motor is what appears to be a standard asynchronous AC motor that locks onto the voltage line frequency . It makes no audible noise , except a slight 60Hz hum , if you listen to it within a couple of inches . The motor does vibrate a bit ( 60Hz ) . The motor is not connected to the table in any way - this needs to be made clear . The motor sits in a hole that is cut out in the table , but the motor rests on the surface underneath the table , not the actual table . I placed some closed cell vinyl weatherstripping foam on the bottom of the motor to acts as further isolation of the motor and resting surface . I also places some of this material in the cut out hole where the motor resides , to prevent accidental direct contact of the motor with the turntable chassis . You can easily shift the motor position when you turn the table on / off , as the on / off switch is located directly on the side of the motor . I measured speed stability using The Ultimate Analog Test LP . I recorded the 3150Hz track and analyzed a 10 second long recording using FFT analysis to determine actual frequency at any given time point . The variance measured was - 0.08 % / + 0.14 % , peak variance . The table isl listed as speed stability of + / - 0.2 % in most specifications , so real performance certainly better than manufacturer specifications . The actual speed stability is probably even better than I measured : it looks like the test record was not ' exactly ' centered on it 's hole , though it was very very close . The motor is not high in torque , and it it takes 4 or 5 seconds to reach speed stability . The motor ' chirps ' a bit when you first turn it on , as it fights the silicone belt . I recommend giving the edge of the platter a little spin to put the table up to speed before turning the motor on : this should help with both motor wear and belt wear . The motor has a machined acrylic pulley attached to it with 3 set screws . I wish the would have used aluminum , just for cosmetic reasons . The acrylic is fine in this capacity . This is a precision machined acrylic part - not a cheap molded plastic piece . Platter Mat : Ditch the mat . The record will be best dampened by direct contact with the acrylic platter . Use a clamp to keep the record tight against the acrylic . Record clamp : The turntable comes with a molded clear plastic Souther Clamp . It is essentially a piece of plastic with a tight fitting hole over the spindle , that grips by friction . I don't like the included plastic Souther clamp . It looks and feels cheap . If you are like me , and what the aesthetic theme to be constant , then get an after market clamp that you like . Cartridge : The Marantz comes with a ClearAudio Virtuoso . This is rather surprising . This cartridge is almost universally praised by users and reviewers alike , and it 's cheapest selling price that I could find online was $ 875 USD . This is a startling quality unit to include in a $ 1600 turntable package . Without the cartridge , I consider the $ 1600 price to be more than fair , considering the superb overall quality / engineering of this table system . The cartridge supposedly comes pre-mounted to the tonearm and is pre-setup . However , my package was missing the cartridge entirely , and as such , Marantz shipped me a new cartridge that is factory sealed in it 's retail packaging . Closest comparable product to the Marantz TT-15S1 is the ClearAudio Emotion . The Emotion uses the same motor and arm . Everything else is different . The Marantz uses substantially heavier / thicker construction , and the Marantz uses more cosmetically appealing feet ( large machined aluminum ) as compared to the small acrylic feet on the Emotion . The Marantz is like the middle product between the ClearAudio Emotion and ClearAudio Performance . The Performance uses a yet , slightly thicker platter , and moves the platter bearing up to the CMB magnetic bearing system , which used magnetic fields to levitate the platter , as opposed to a physically contacting bearing and shaft . From other brands , the ONLY product I have found that seems comparable with the Marantz and is in the same price range is the VPI Scout . However , the Scout does not have the same quality of bearings in it 's tone arm an the Scout may have a slightly more resonant chassis , as it is made primarily of MDF compared to the solid machined air craft grade arcylic of the Marantz chassis . The Scout has a slightly thicker platter as compared to the Marantz . The Scout has an isolated motor as well . The VPI Scout and Marantz TT-15S1 , in fact , were the main two tables that I had to choose from . I don't think you can go wrong with either one of these for the dollars spent . I don't think you can possibly get more real performance in terms of audibility by getting a table that costs more than the VPI or Marantz at issue here . Psychological differences , of course , are a different story . If you refuse to believe that ' only ' about $ 2k can get you a transparent table / arm system , then you will certainly perceive differences , regardless if they are real or not . So far as other brands with models in the same price range , such as Music Hall , Pro-Ject or Rega : I can not buy into it . They appear to be far less substantial in construction / engineering as compared to the VPI and Marantz at issue here . I am looking for the most engineering / build quality for my dollar . Sound : As you have probably noticed , I have not said anything about sound quality . This is because I literally can not detect any signature caused by the turntable itself or the tone arm in this case . Any coloration ( s ) appear to be the result of the vinyl album used or the cartridge . The table here appears to be a near-perfect neutral device , which is exactly what I wanted to begin with . This table should not limit ANY cartridge or album .  
1	  I have owned 2 different rio products , both of which have failed me within 4-5 months of purchase . The life expectancy of their mp3 players is poor , as is their waranty , as I was told that for 100 dollars and the unit they would give me a new one . The hard drive went out on both mp3 players , and I was told that your not supposed to move the player when its in use . Never mind the fact that its a portable mp3 player . Other than the fact that its hard drive died , my rio nitrous was an outstanding value .. until it died . Dont take my word for it . Check out what everyone else thinks on epinions . com  
1	  This was a marvelous voice recorder .. until I changed from XP to Vista . The patches issued by Olympus won't work ( as you can read on endless web-forums ) . So think twice before you buy it if you are a Vista user .  
1	  Philips seems to always make sure to throw in a few counter-functional elements into their products , and this one is no exception . The lack of shuffle or repeat functions is forgivable , the lack of fast-forwarding is not . This function is replaced by " super-skip " , which lets you scroll through the folders pretty quickly . Nice , but nowhere close to necessary on a player that only holds about 50 tracks . In addition to this , the player shuts itself off after being put on pause for more than a few seconds . This doesn't only make the pause function worthless , it 's also a major problem if you listen to podcasts or audiobooks . Say you 're an hour into an mp3 and have to pause a bit to pay for a coffee or whatever . Once you 're ready to keep listening , the player has gone to sleep and you 'll have to leave the player running for an hour until you get back to where you were . Just plain stupid . There are much , MUCH better players to be found at this price , so even if you only need a player for music purposes , there 's no reason not to look elsewhere . Beware that the control pad , which is separate from the player , has a history of malfunction . These are being returned to the electronics store where I work on a regular basis , and you will not be able to operate or even activate the player until you receive a new one .  
2	  I 've bought 2 times the same product , and I 'm very happy with this SD . Used on a SLR Digital Camera , is fast and reliable . I recommend .  
2	  I am pleased so far with this product which I got as a generic charger replacement for a Nikon 2500 Digital camera . Price was quite good .. included extra battery .. and car charger . This purchase was better than original accessories for camera .. item was delivered quickly , less than one week .. so far , so good ..  
2	  Got it in a very timely manner . Love being able to label various items , wish that it was dish washer resistant , or at least lasted longer from washing .  
1	  I am not happy with the quality of printing from this cartridge , it is definitely not crisp and dark ( sorta grayish and faded )  
2	  I had always used HP ( with it all my HP paper ) and then after the complete disaster with my Photosmart 7660 I decided to try Epson . After looking thru several Epson printers that worked with MAC Os I found this great all in one , but then when it got home i tried printing on my infinite supply of HP Double Sided Brochure Paper but it didn't work with any of the pre-sets in the printing window . So now I have almost 50 sheets of this paper that i cannot use . Besides that is an excellent printer with excellent printing quality  
1	  Trying to move some old files from my old G4 to my new MacBook , I was hoping an external zip drive would do the trick . Macs are supposed to have built in drivers for this unit , and it 's advertised to be compatible , but it didn't work and the seller - no surprise - wasn't willing to refund me . If you are a Mac user , I strongly suggest you investigate other options for transferring files .  
1	  I bought this unit to get an ATSC tuner cheap and to be able to record shows . Well , it kind of works , but nothing is great . The remote control is terrible . Its credit card sized and gets lost real easy . It also doesn't control much . The television guide is generic and comes from ( .. ) . You have to sign in and scroll on the internet with your mouse which is a nuisance to me because it should work with the remote , but it doesn't . You can't even click on a show and go to it . The remote control has to be directly in front of the box to work , also . This unit is cheap and you get what you pay for . I thought it would pause and rewind live TV , but it won't for me . There are so much better products than this out there so pay a little more and be much happier .  
1	  This DVD recorder seems to use cheap parts that result in a large % of disc-burnin failures . Even though DVD-R is cheap these days ( but not so with DVD-RAM ) , you 'll be much better off and happier with DVD recorders from Panasonic . ( The Panasonic DVD recorder / VCR combo is also $ 200 cheaper ! )  
2	  Perfect .. love the hard case cover . The size and product is perfect for travelling too . This the 4th one I have bought .  
2	  The headphones are alright .. I like the way the volume control is .. but when you put them on , it 's another story . Your head will look like a light bulb or something , I laughed when I saw myself in the mirror with them on .  
1	  Fell apart when I unboxed it . Circuit board was not attached , making it almost impossible to use . Not worth the hassle to return . Went to Frys and got a better one for the same price .  
2	  Specially if you want to attach external speakers to your tv or other electronic device that doesn't have a 3.5 mm audio jack input ..  
1	  Constant fm hiss , reception and output vary in the area of the car . Do not buy this item . I bought it from best buy at 50 $ which also pisses me off . 20 $ more and it isn't worth the 30 $ I wish I had paid for it .  
2	  Toshiba Satellite P205-S6267 17 " Laptop ( Intel Core Duo Processor T2350 , 2 GB RAM , 120 GB Hard Drive , SuperMulti DVD Drive , Vista Premium ) Worked for more than 1 year now , and am still excited . It never failed . 17 " + light = 1-2 hours of battery power - that 's the tradeoff I accepted . Enjoy .  
2	  This very affordable digital antenna does a heck of a job picking HD local channels . My satellite provider does not have locals in my area ( Indianapolis ) . I live 11-17 miles from the broadcast towers and have no landscape or building obstructions to interfere with the signal , so I went with a passive ( versus a more expensive amplified ) antenna . This antenna picks up CW , PBS , FOX , CBS , NBC , and ABC in HD with a signal strength of 77-98 % ( avg . ~ 88 %) . I have this antenna setting behind my 50 " Panny Plasma ( obscuring its massive ugliness ) and connected through a ViP 722 ( allowing the recording of OTA signals onto the DVR ) . The only cons ( as previously mentioned in other reviews ) is the size of the antenna ( bigger than 3 ' x 3 ' when extended ) and the short length of the coax connection cable ( ~ 3 ' ) . Overall , this antenna gives a big bang for a small buck .  
2	  Great article , reliable , I haven't had any problems . Maps can be found free in the internet , and not much else is needed to use .  
1	  I just received this Tao from Amazon on March 23 , 2006 to give to my wife for our Anniversary . I 've never had a satellite radio before . After I opened the package and got ready to install the thing in my wife 's car , I noticed the battery compartment latch button on the unit wasn't working when I pushed it to open it . It actually wouldn't push in to remove the compartment door . I also noticed a rattling noise coming from inside the unit near the latch as though some pieces were loose inside the unit . I thought at first that the rattle was part of the antenna port on the device . After attempting to push the button to the compartment so I could install the battery , the latch button became very loose and suddenly dropped inside of the unit . It didn't actually break but just became loose and fell inside the unit . Perhaps I just got one that was bad . Who knows ? I 'm glad that Amazon makes it so easy to return items with their print out labels and pre-paid postage . Now , I 've just re-ordered the Delphi XM2go version of the same unit from Amazon ( which was probably made by the same manufacturer ) in hopes of better quality control . Oh BTW - On a positive note , after the button dropped inside the unit , it did stop rattling . Go figure .  
1	  The adapter works great for replacing the xbox controller connection to the Turtle Beach headset - it is the only one I could find on the web at all . My problem with the product is that the photo was of an adapter / extension cable , but only the adapter was provided . As a result , I needed to use an 1/8 " patch cable to go from the adapter to the headset - worked out in the end , but not what was advertised . Also , they charged me $ 18 for shipping which was ridiculous !  
1	  Out of 50 , I was able to burn six CD 'S , an 88 % failure rate .  
1	  It was meant for a 6-person real estate management office . We repacked and returned it within one week . The set up and config were easy . The printer 's control panel prompted for user action EVERY time non-letter-sized media was detected . It worked fine for single copy jobs but continuously jammed up for multi-page copies causing the toner wastefully smeared over hands and paper when unjamming . Canon brand toner cartridge at around $ 140 a piece would need replacement frequently .  
1	  Consider another receiver before buying Delorme 's . Delorme 's receiver works only with their software ( the receiver does not conform to any standard , unlike most other receivers . ) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate . Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home , I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly . Finally , with the receiver I have , even after the device as been initialized , Delorme 's software sometimes is unable to find it . ( I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out , but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much ) . Real irritating out on the road , as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages .  
2	  I had been looking around at Best buy and Target for an SD card for a week or so . When I saw how much they were going for on Amazon - less than half price , I could not believe it ! I ordered one right away and was thankful that best buy was out of the 4 GB cards the day I intended to buy , that were going for more ! The product came promptly and from then on , I tell every one about the great prices and the reliability of ordering on Amazon . com !  
1	  i am disappointed with my purchase . after trying the HP Photosmart C8100 ( $ 400 ) , and the Epson Artisan 800 ( $ 300 ) , i decided to purchase a color laser printer to print flyers and to print on card stock . the Xerox Phaser 8560 ( $ 600 ) seemed to have a slightly better print quality over the inkjets so i kept it . after buying $ 200 on Xerox Color Xpressions Elite cover paper to print business cards on , i ran my first job . the machine jammed after about 40 sheets into the run and continued to do so every 10 , 20 , or 40 sheets . i was so frustrated by the end of the job . it took 3x longer than it should have . so much for high productivity with this machine .  
1	  Sony Premium Grade T-120 VHS Tapes used to be pretty darn good . These days that is not the case . The past few times that I have bought these tapes to record movies from the satellite dish , there have been to many flaws with the tape . One problem has been a line through the middle of the picture , like you sometimes have when you rent a movie thats about 20 years old , and also there have been jumping pictures , and small audio flaws as well . I use various brands of videotape , so I know that the problem lies here with the Sony videotape . Basically the record about as well as a tape you have recorded on over and over and over . They show too much wear way too soon . Get Maxell tapes instead .  
2	  I have had two of these Samsonite brief cases through my 27 years in the home building business and I can tell you they hold up very well . They have been vwery functional and have an impressive style . Very tough exterior .. DDC  
1	  I just don't understand why I have to pay California tax on a online purchase outside of the state . First , let me say I have purchased 3 computers from Dell before . I have NOT pay any tax on those computers and that 's the thing I like about it . $ 2000 to $ 3000 computer save me a lot on the tax . If I have to pay tax , I am going to buy it from a local store . In a case where there is a problem , I can just bring it back to the store .  
2	  I just ordered a second one of these ! We had the first one for almost three years now , and never had any problems with it . My kids watch german DVDs with this DVD player almost every day . We are very happy with this product !  
2	  This trackball was a gift and I enjoyed it very much , exept that you have to clean it often and the ( rollers ? ) don't last very long . Within a year I had to replace the mouse .  
2	  This radio & speaker system had all the features I wanted for my son 's Ipod . It sits on his nightstand and delivers good sound throughout his room .  
2	  Came in original box even though it said there would be no box . Price was great and product works perfectly .  
1	  Sounds repetitive , but it 's true : worked for one month , then even with a new bulb , it didn't . I know it 's getting power , because the power light is on , but no zap-o-matic . I agree with all the other reviews-this is recycling material that should have been canned at the engineering stage , not mass-produced and pushed in fancy packaging to big-box retailers . What in the world causes companies to produce garbage like this and expect the word won't get out ?  
1	  I bought a sharp lcd tv from j & r in new york last Jan , after a year and half , when powering on the tv , sometimes works , sometimes not . after unplug in , wait for a while and plug back , worked for a couple months . Send it to service center to checkup , was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced . when request to get back the replaced lcd control board , was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board , it has to be shipped back , otherwise , you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced board .. it 's rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any vendor .. But , if you do want to get a sharp , better get a long long warranty ..

1	  I wanted a new battery for My Canon camera , but I did not want to pay Canon 's high price . Past experience with generic batteries was less than satisfactory , so I passed up an opportunity to purchase a number of generic options in the $ 5 - $ 6 price range . Instead , I chose to purchase an Eveready Energizer replacement , ER-D150 from Accessory Genie for about $ 15 . It was worth it to me to pay the extra money to get the Energizer brand . Accessory Genie did not state that they would send a generic equivalent , they stated that they were selling and would ship the Eveready Energizer battery . I just received the shipment . On my packing list , it states that they shipped " 1 ER-D150 Energizer for Canon NB-4L " . But that is a lie . They shipped a generic battery made by Pro Power . This is completely false advertising and is 100 % unacceptable . Be Honest and say so if you 're selling a generic . I am very , very disappointed .  
2	  In this times , where all of us is trying kill flys with canons , this lens , make you think a little more in the photo , and use your feets . Great for portraits , but this is not new . I love its DOF and the luminosity . A lens cheap , but very powerfull .  
1	  It appears NAVMAN does not have map updatesfor this product . Which means that over time it will become useless . Indeed , the last several business trips I 've takem , NAVMAN cannotfind the hotel I 'm staying at . Things I like about the unit : - You can search for nearest point of interest without specifying thehotel . - You can turn off the safety stuff that some GPS units haveto prevent the driver from entering data while the car is moving . This allows passengers to manage the navigation without stopping theengine . - PriceThings I dislike : - The points of interest menu doesn't have a grocery store category . That is just stupid . On the bright side , if you know what themajor grocery store names are in the area you are travelling theunit will find them quickly . - Sometimes it takes 15 or minutes for the unit to get a GPS fixespecially during a rainstorm . Leave it turned on . - The USA voices are too hard to hear while the car is running . The British voices are easy to hear though . - WiFi signals interfere the remote control , and so whentrying to enter data while my laptop is turned on , it is as if there is phantom competing with me to push buttons . The unit has a remote control . This is overkill . It also has a touchscreen which is overkill ; just use the buttons on the thing .  
1	  Simply put , do not buy this computer if it has Windows Vista . It is slow , freezes up , and was very difficult for my secretary , who is so so computer literate , to use . This was without the installation of any third party software , but right out of the box . When she wanted to sort names in a folder , it grouped them in alphabetical segments of A-H , I-M etc and it took her 20 minutes to figure out how to undo this . It is a bloated poorly done program , and it seems as though Microsoft didn't test this with a single consumer , or they wouldn't have released it like this . Also , I ordered it with Windows XP , but they shipped it with Vista . It was too difficult for me to pack up and to return , as I didn't discover it was Vista until I had it all set up and installed in a desk , which took about three hours , and I was essentially stuck with it . Finally , when we got around to installing our peripherals-card scanners , printers , and lab equipment , much of it could not be used as the companies had not yet developed drivers for Vista , including such unknown mom and pop operations like Fujitsu , Siemens , and Kodak . Microsoft blew this one badly .  
1	  This camera is just OK for a beginners camera in terms of functionality , but for the money I would just get something better . I find it hard to get clear pictures of objects from very close proximity , and this thing uses up batteries ( even high quality rechargeable ones ) faster than any other device I have ever seen . I also find this camera to be worse than most with getting a steady shot and avoiding blurs . I have an upgraded memory card in mine with larger-than-stock capacity , but I find it annoying how the camera limits you to only 60 second videos despite there being enough memory to hold many minutes of footage with ease . Now for the worst part about this camera .. I can only get about 8 to 12 shots out of a set of freshly charged 2500 mAH batteries before the camera completely shuts off due to it saying that the batteries are dead . It 's almost a crime for the manufacturer to put something on the market that is this ridiculous with battery annihilation . I simply can not recommend this camera to anyone based purely on the battery problems that it has .. WARNING .. STAY AWAY !  
1	  Sony said the camera had a " Fine " setting , but the actual camera does not . You can't stop the camera from automatically reducing noise , which makes everything look like an impressionistic painting - very strange . They WILL NOT respond to inquiries about the camera . Also many models have defects in the lens causing many focus and fringing problems . Also everything extra about the camera is proprietary . You have to buy Sony filters , Sony batteries etc . for the camera due to irregular size that only Sony makes . Shame on you Sony for ignoring customers and putting out a sub par camera just for profit . Until Sony fixes the fine setting and aggressive compression on this camera STAY AWAY ! ChadfishUpdate 5/28/07 : I have worked very hard with this camera in many different lighting / subject situations and the image quality is just NOT there . Now I can't return the camera and I 'm stuck . I revise my review to 0 stars because Sony took our trust and sold us a camera that was lower in quality than the previous model . They cheaped out on the sensor , and the sensor is EVERYTHING . Always wait for a professional review before you buy . Read the review on Megapixel , they are accurate .  
2	  I have always preferred " perked " coffee . However , after my old percolator died , I made the mistake of trying a couple of pour through coffee makers . Both of these died after just a few months of making average coffee that never seemed warm enough . The presto makes excellent coffee in a short time and keeps it HOT ! If you are in the market for a coffee maker , I strongly recommend this product . I shopped around a lot before this purchase and Amazon had the best price . This was exactly what I needed and of course it was shipped very quickly . I give Amazon and Presto five stars !  
2	  I just got this for my work , and have set up using the web-browser based setup interface . It 's a bit flaky user interface , but gets the job done and is straight forward . Also , it seems to have lower sync rate than SMC 802.11b Barricade wireless access point I have used before with my Netgear MA401 card . It takes a while for the computer to recognize ( like 20 seconds instead of instantaneous ) that it is receiving a good signal after waking up from a standby . The signal strength is excellent , though I will be increasing that with their optional signal booster WSB24 . Tech rep said that 802.11b signal booster also works fine with this 54G access point to increase the signal strength because both protocols use the 2.4GHz range , which is a definite plus if you need good coverage . I will be getting their 54mbps card within a couple of days , so this will be interesting , as I am using the Netgear MA401 card right now and experiencing this slight delay in re-synchronizing after a wake up from standby . I 've had problems making Macintosh to access with the WEP enabled ( both 64bit and 128bit ) , but may be likely that is a Mac problem . All in all , it is so far an excellent value , should be interesting to see what the signal booster and a 54G card should do in addition to this access point ..  
2	  As someone who spends a lot of time on airplanes , I have to say these are worth the money . You have to find the right spot , everyone else has said the same thing . It took me about three times of wearing them , before finding the right spot for my ears . Everyone 's ears are different . Now I use them at the gym , and at the park when going for a run , and in the hotel gyms where the music is often really loud and nothing I care to hear . The sound isolation is nice , almost like earplugs , which come in handy when trying to rest on busy flights . The sound they reproduce seems very clean , I am not an expert , it just sounds nice .. After realizing that I was trying to drown out sound with the volume on my old headsets , I can now listen to these at very low , well sounding volume . I keep reading how you must be careful of earbuds , because they are designed to send the sound directly into your ear canal , and that could be dangerous . So use with caution , and not as you would use other headsets . I give them four stars simply because it takes a while to get used to the fit , and which tips to use before you figure out how well they work .  
1	  if the back of the creative comes off , which it does verry easily , and the battery comes out , the harddrive will get all messed up and you will need to buy a new one , it happened to me as i was driving .  
2	  Bought this receiver since it has pre-amp output . Needed this feature as I am using wireless speakers ( JBL ) for the surround channels . The wireless speakers have their own amplifier and cannot be used with full amplifier outputs . This feature is only found on more expensive receivers from any manufacturer . To find it on a receiver retailing for $ 300 is quite a surprise . Of course the trade off is the lack of HDMI but I am not aware of any receiver processing the audio part of the HDMI connection . Based on other reviews , I am sure it will sound good when it arrives . Manual is huge .  
2	  Overall impression is very good . AA battery req . and only need one ! Onboard EQ is good feature to have . Need some design improvement on the arm band , or come up with an alternative . The armband squeezes my arm ( blood pressure reading anyone ? ) that it left a mark . You wouldn't want it loose too much so that it won't keep sliding down your arm while running . Very versatile . Brought it to work and attched my computer 's speaker cable into it for an on-demand jukebox ! Your friends will get crazy with envy .  
1	  This is my third pool of this style . The first was given to me by a friend , and I was the third or fourth owner . The air ring had a slow leak . No big deal I figured , the thing was old anyway . Early this summer I got a new , off brand one for cheap at the local grocery store . It also had a leak in the air ring . I figured , well , that 's what I get for buying an off brand piece of junk . Drained the pool and returned and got my money back . I then decided to get a good Intex one , $ 25 more than the off brand junk . Set it up , and two days later , another air leak ! It 's very frustrating to have to pump the air ring up a bit every single day . I had to arrange a neighbor to come over to inflate it every day while I was on vacation . What 's even more frustrating is that I emailed the seller , Blue Fade Inc . , about it and received not a single response . Nothing , just complete silence . Very unhappy . I will say however that otherwise build quality seems decent enough , pump seems good and nicer quality in every way than the off brand junk I bought prior to this one . My rating would be far higher if 1 ) there were no air leaks , and 2 ) Blue Fade had actually replied and provided some customer service .  
2	  not bad for over the ears . Love how I change the color . And the sound is pretty good .  
2	  I bought this camera earlier this year at Office Max for only $ 50 with two reasons in mind . One of them was I wanted a cheap digital camera that took good pictures and I could bring anywhere . This way if something happened to it , it wouldn't matter since it didn't cost a lot anyways . The second reason was that it takes 2 AA batteries . I like this because all I need is 4 rechargeable AA 's and I 'm set . I wasn't sure of how good the pictures would be since I always used to hear 3 megapixels or better was a must . Not at all , I have taken hundreds of great photos with this camera of many things , including lots of different scenery and the pictures look amazing . My friends and family can't believe some of the pictures I 've taken with just this camera . I always use the 1600x1200 resolution on the highest quality since I have a 256MB SD card . Speaking of that , the internal memory is only 7MB , but with how cheap SD cards are now , getting a 256 or 512MB SD card shouldn't be a problem . PROS : - Great camera for the right price-Takes great photos-Can record movies-With a 512MB SD card you can take about 700 photos on the highest quality / resolution , more than enough for a vacation . You can also record lots of video , I recorded 21 minutes of video on my 256MB card and still had 60MB of space left . - Battery life isn't too bad . I remember reading somewhere that it can take 120 photos without the flash before the batteries die . I went on a vacation and took around 130 photos and they still worked afterwards . CONS : - Doesn't record sound in video . Something I kinda wanted , but don't care THAT much for , especially since I really bought this camera for pictures . - Pictures get kinda blurry if you shake the camera while taking a picture I don't know how common this is in digital cameras though . - Can only take up to 512MB memory cards . For me this is no problem , but it might be for someone out there . - Pictures look kinda crappy if you zoom up . I don't remember for sure , but I think this was a downside to digital zoom . I try to avoid zooming in as much as possible , or if I do I zoom in just a little .  
1	  Ok , so if you are the average consumer , such as myself , you probably have an mp3 player of some sort . If you own an Apple iPod , then you and I along with 58 million other unsuspecting consumers have been had . BIG TIME . I too fell into the trance of the white earbuds , but no longer will I remain an Apple lemur . I bought a 4th generation iPod and was so excited that I too was going to be sporting the ultimate in mp3 players ! Boy , was I STUPID ! I commute to Boston on the commuter rail , which is about a forty-minute ride into town , switch to the subway for 10 minutes , and then walk to my building in about 3 minutes . I am not a runner so when I say walk it 's a stroll . Nothing aggressive . After about 2 and months with my new toy , the problems began . Freeze ups began to occur in the middle of playing songs . This happened everyday for a few months . I sought help from Apple at their website and performed all steps they suggest to get the iPod back on the straight and narrow . I reset it ( lost all my music every time I did this ) , then a few months later I kept receiving a folder icon with exclamation point . I went back to the Apple website , in which I was a regular visitor , and followed their instructions for the new error ( Put iPod into disk mode and reinstall the driver hardware ) . This happened on and off for the next few months along with the freezing thing . Then the biggie of all biggies started to happen after just one year of ownership . I got , what I thought was cute at the time , a picture of an iPod on my screen with a sad face telling me to contact Apple Support . I proceeded to contact an iPod specialist using the phone number provided by Apple . The first thing I heard that disgusted me was my 90-day warranty was up and now had to either buy an Apple Care plan for $ 99.00 and have support from them for two years or pay a $ 50 per incident fee . Immediately I asked why as it was to my understanding that iPod was covered for 1 year from the date of purchase . I was told that yes this was correct but phone support was 90 days only . If my iPod needed service , I would have to create an account on their website and issue a request for service . I was floored by the lack of help right from the get go . You get three months to have a problem with your brand new almost $ 300 dollar purchase , and then you are told go away to no - man 's land and submit a request , because unless you pay $ 50 or $ 99.00 , human contact is not an option . After steaming for a few moments , I realized I still had a broken iPod to fix . I proceeded to no-man 's land and filled out my service request . I sent Apple my player and waited a couple of weeks for a response . Needless to say , I could have waited forever because the answer they gave was and still is unacceptable . My $ 299.00 technological marvel , my portable music librarian , my expensively priced modern convenience 's hard drive had failed . I was out of warranty by a week or two . I inquired about the cost for repair . $ 268.40 to bring it back from the dead . " ARE YOU KIDDING ME ! " I screamed into the poor person 's unsuspecting ear on the phone . The tech said he gets that a lot and I proceeded to tell him I understood why people scream . He told me the best thing to do would be to buy another unit since the cost was comparable , in fact a bit cheaper at $ 249.00 and I would have a new updated unit . So , being a stupid sucker for punishment , I went out and spent $ 250 dollars on another 4th generation iPod . I intended to buy one as a gift for my boyfriend anyway for his birthday so this justified the purchase for me . I chalked up my lousy experience to a one-time glitch . Couldn't happen again type of thing . Well , guess what ? Please read on .. He started to commute to work and after leaving the iPod in the box for months , he decided now was the time to use his new gadget . He only used it when he walked the 1 mile to and from the subway stop to work . Total 2 miles a day , walking . Needless to say , 6 months of light use and I had another stupid , little , annoying iPod picture with its brainless sad face staring back at me . It was like looking at a kid who just broke an expensive vase and could do nothing but be sorry about it . This time , I thought I was going to get a bit of a break . After all , Apple opened up an Apple Store in a mall close to work . No need to send out the unit . I could get my painful diagnosis in person . So I make an appointment online , as you can't do that over the phone ( you know they hate that human contact thing ) and I show up to the " Genius Bar " to meet the iPod Genius . This guy had the T-shirt that said he was in fact an " iPod Genius " . I hand over the little devil and he then proceeds to tell me what I already knew . HARD DRIVE FAILURE . I never really delved into why this cataclysmic event happened the first time with the tech guy from Apple regarding my unit , so , I figured after spending $ 600 on 2 products in a bid to help build Apple 's employee retirement fund , I wanted some legitimate answers . I then proceed to ask the so called " iPod Genius " why this keeps happening , explaining that this is the second iPod I had purchased in a 2.5 year span and they BOTH did the same exact thing . He then went on to explain that it is a hard drive player and if it is jostled around too much , it eventually fails . He then pointed out a tiny little scratch it had received on the bottom back and said " this player took a fall . Once that happens , it 's only a matter of time before failure occurs . " I then explained that it may have fallen out of my hands once but it was at waist level and fell onto a kitchen floor . Hardly an abusive drop . I was not slamming the thing around like King Kong and neither was my boyfriend . The " Genius " then said that just stepping off the curb the wrong way when a song is playing or changing to another song will eventually cause hard drive failure . I then said to the " Genius " " It states on Apple 's website that you can use iPod for exercise , it 's a great workout companion . My boyfriend and I only WALKED with it and it got jostled enough to DIE ? " So what you are telling me is you CANNOT run , walk , possibly talk , step off curbs ( guess you have to float or fly ) , NEVER drop it , or move it around whatsoever because any or all of these events can jostle it and cause it to fail ? So , stand perfectly still or pay $ 268.40 to repair it or $ 249.00 to buy a new one ? " Of course , the " Genius " sat there dumbfounded and had no response . IS APPLE SERIOUS ! What the H # & L ; kind of product are they selling to consumers ? They market a portable product that needs rubber padding and a steel casing just to be able to use it . The " Genius " however , did offer me 10 % off a purchase of another iPod with trade in of the old one . Did he really think I was going to fall into the white earphone trance for the third time ? Apple should be ashamed of their business practices . But then again , why would they even care ? People think mp3 the first thing they think of is iPod . EDUCATE YOURSELF ! Do the research and turn away from the light ! If the product that they sell is that sensitive , then it should be marketed accordingly with a statement such as : " product needs to be securely fastened to the wall for use . " I am totally disgusted and of course Apple is of no help , as it would affect their bottom line . People please take my advice . Upgrade you phone to an mp3 player when your " upgrade time comes you can usually do this for WAY less than an iPod . Sandisk Sansa e280 is what i purchased and will NEVER GO BACK ! It is an 8GB flash player with an expandible memory slot which means you can ADD MEMORY SPACE ! It has more features than the Nano and cheaper if you do price comparison on the web . Check other companies such as Creative and iRiver for their players and only use Apple for what they should be used for . Making Pies !  
1	  I purchased two different versions of Memorex 's CD-R 's ( one spindle of 50 with the plain grey face and another 50 with a metallic-blue color ) and neither works on three different CD / DVD writers : an HP 740b , an LG GSA-H55L or an LG GE20LU10 . I have wasted God knows how many discs trying to successfully burn a data CD disc but no success thus far . They just will not burn a disc successfully , and I 've tried multiple popular CD bruneing software apps . Maybe that 's why they were on sale when I bought them ? BUYER BEWARE !  
1	  I actually own the 110 model . After 18 months , it no longer reads disks PERIOD . Read the other reviews and avoid Panasonic .  
2	  I purchased one of these units , and I am blown away with what it does . I love to keep all of my equipment hidden out of view , and in my case , everything is in a cubby hole under the stairs , with no equipment in sight . This unit allows me to use a regular ol ' remote control without tearing up the walls and trying to hardwire a more expensive IR Repeater through the house . It works as advertised , and I 've now used it with several different remotes , and I 'm very happy with it ! I 'll recommend it to anyone !  
1	  Got a pair of these for Christmas from my daughter . They had all the performance I could expect from a 12 year old 's budget - the sound was pretty good , though they need more insulation , and my ears are a bit bigger than the cans . Having wires running down both sides means you can't ever have the free side on the right side . They don't stay adjusted where you put them , and eventually one of the loose slider adjusters came apart and I had to pop-rivet that side back together . A few weeks later , the thin spot on the wishbone snapped off on one side , and when I looked , the other side was cracked . We managed to zip-tie things together until the other side broke . The plastic on the headgear is crap , and is what ultimately made them useless . The lid on my Costco laundry soap is made from tougher plastic - really . They still sound fine , but now you have to hold the two cans yourself . not sure what she paid for them , but think I 'll look closely at the headgear before I buy my next headphones .  
1	  I bought this for a party and it did pretty good . Now I will use it in our screen room .. sound is good but not great .  
2	  I bought this because I found out that my home theater receiver is a power hog . It uses 60 watts even when " off " . I did the math , and assuming I want it on 6 hours a day , this would pay back fast . I added a few extra things : a sub woofer ( 6w at idle ) , VCR ( 7w when " off " ) , and a DVD player ( 2w when off ) . I measured all this with my Kill-a-Watt . Add that up and you get 75w that 's wasted . Multiply 75w * 18 hours a day * 365 days * $ 0.18 ( cost of a kwh of electricity here ) / 1000 = $ 89 / year in savings . This thing will take less than 6 months to pay for itself . You can plug in your own numbers and figure your payback time . Installation was a breeze . I plugged my tv into the " control " outlet . My receiver , VCR , sub woofer , and DVD player got plugged into the switched outlets . There are some always on outlets too , and I plugged the UPS that has my Wii and TiVo into one of those . Then I turned on the power switch . No adjustment was necessary . Now when I turn on my TV , the receiver and sub ( and the rest ) turn on with it . When I turn off the TV , the rest of the stuff turns off too .  
2	  Great little hub for a desktop or laptop computer . The size makes it prefect for travel or placement out of the way on a desktop . You can us this hub in a powered or unpowered mode . This makes it one of the best hubs I have ever owned . I would buy one again !  
2	  This product was ideal ! It allowed me to keep the current Bose speakers and amp . Wiring was simple ! A must have if you have a factory Bose system !  
1	  The part I received does not work but but to get it replaced I have to pay to ship it back and include a check for shipping of a replacement . After paying shipping 2 more times I will have had to pay for this thing twice , and there 's still no guarantee the 2nd part will function properly . I 've decided to cut my losses and throw the remote away . Don't waste your money . They obviously don't have very good quality control and an even worse warranty policy .  
1	  Absolutely disappointing . Purchased this to replace my monster icarplay wireless that I used for years since the cords were fraying and the sound quality on this was horrible . Better sound came out of my ipod playing it through the device without headphones on then the muffled static that was emitting on every station I tried . I live near a metro area but still in the suburbs . Going to purchase another monster product instead . Save your money !  
2	  Fits perfectly to all of my 58mm lens . Couldn't ask for more . Pictures do come out much better , and I feel so much more secure knowing that my Canon lens are protected . Highly recommend this product .  
1	  I bought this set , and almost ninety days to the minute after the warranty expired the set broke down , after which a perfectly pleasant customer service representative told me I was on my own . Nice concept , poor execution . My advice , find a better model .  
2	  This is one of the better combination TV-VCRs I have seen . Panasonic and Sony also both make good 13inch TVs . Toshiba 's combination TV-VCRs often gets overlooked . However , this is an excellent set and performs equally well . The picture is crisp and sharp . The built-in Digital tracking 4 head VCR makes VHS tapes look very good . You get front A / V ( RCA type ) inputs with a TV / game switch . The VCR has good high-speed fast-forward and rewind performance . It also has time-shift recording capability and a built-in head cleaner . The front panel features a useful headphone jack . The ` Black ' cabinet design is uniquely handsome and looks better than other competitor models .  
2	  Unit has very useable features and is simple to use . Tones are a little annoying , but maybe this is a good thing . Memory function and volume control are very useful . Detection seems to be good . Lot 's of false alarms due to sensitvity being so high . This is a given trade off . Voice is easy to understand . Automute is a very nice feature in congested areas .  
1	  The armband seems very durable , but on the first attempt to slide my Sansa e250 into the pocket , the reflective striping cracked and broke in 3 places . The actual pocket is made of a really nice stretchy material , but the outer covering has no give .  
2	  For the price - you can't beat it - when you don't want to turn on a hot oven during the hot summer days , this will save that and cook your delicious meals in a fraction of the time - very well built with no problems whatsoever  
2	  We bought the Canon Pixma 600 after purchase of the Pixma 960 - which proved to be a very fast printer with excellent scanning capbility , verh high quality photo color and very sharp text . The Pixma 600 uses 5 ink cartridges instead of 7 on the 960 and after one month of use appears to provide the same high quality color prints , photo scanning and text printing at about 1/2 the price of the 960 . In both the 960 and 600 it is a little tricky assembling the ink cartridges into their respective slots in the carrier , but the directions are reasonably clear and when the cartridges are inserted properly , an LED on the cartridge lights up telling you the individual cartridge is installed properly . Very nice . The software is a joy to use giving you clear information about printer status , adjustments , ink status , etc . The Pixma 600 is a great printer and a great value . Overall ease of use and quality of photos is far better than our old HP Office Jet G55 .  
1	  I normally give positive reviews . This is the first time I 've felt like I had to warn others not to buy the product . The sound is not that good . I 'm no audiophile , but they just aren't very good . The volume is lower than normal headphones . Okay , so turn it up , you say . Another problem is that it 's easy for others to hear what you 're listening to . This s because of the " open " design . So now you have to turn it up and bother other people . The stuupid design where one side has a longer cord than the other is downright aggravating ! I understand the concept , but the execution fails miserably . The simple fact is that the shorter one is too short ! This makes the left one ( the shorter one ) pull on your ear . No biggie , right ? We 're tough people . Ah , but there 's another problem ! The headphones are hinged so that the wearer can open them up ( I guess so that one can listen to someone / something while keeping the headphones on ) . The problem is .. they are so loose that they 'll fall right off of your ears if you take a step , turn your head , catch a breeze , sneeze , smile , breathe , stare at a painting , etc . So .. you 'll have subpar sounding headphones ( with the left one pulling on your ear ) that 'll bother others because you 've turned the volume up .. until they just fall off of your head ( which will happen often , believe me ) . Please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for decent headphones .  
1	  I purchased this pack as an up grade from my TAMRAC EXPEDITION 3 , as I needed a pack that could carry a notebook computer and a camera . It 's just the right size for all my gear as an airline carry on and it 's a great looking pack . But it stops there . Here 's the bugs . . . 1 . When you pick up the pack by the handle on the top , it pulls on thestitching that holds the flap to the pack . There is no continuous loadpath from the handle to the underside of the pack . Time will tell ifthe stitching holds . 2 . The camera compartment has only three dividers . Two that are " T " shaped and one small straight piece . With limited Velcro , customization is not an option , unless you do some modding . If I buya new lens , I would like to have a space to fit a lens rather that alens to fit a space . 3 . The pack comes with a rain cover . I 'm guessing that if it rains , itwon't repel water . As an experiment , I dripped some tea on one ofthe front covers and the liquid beaded right off the material . However , when I put a drop one a horizontal surface and touched thebead , the material seemed to soak up the liquid . ( did I just void thewarranty ? ) 4 . There are no modern clasps . Instead , there are metal frictionbuckles . This makes it a little slower removing and fastening gear tothe pack . So why did I buy this pack ? Well . . . If the top handle rips off one day , it 'll look great doing it . If I buy another lens and it won't fit , it 'll look great doing it . If I get rained on with the pack I 'll look great doing it . And if I need to strap on some gear in a hurry but can't because of the looping buckles , I 'll look great doing it . . . Did I mention that it 's a great looking pack ?  
2	  This Toshiba has every feature you could want , in a moderatelypriced laptop . More than other brands , I have seen . The features are well designed & very easyto use . This is 5 stars . Whats not to like ? But .. this is a LOW priced laptop ! A good computer and a good value , surely .  
1	  I purchased the product since description said it will work on " Casio Exilim Z1000 / Z600 / S600 cameras " . when I put it in my camera , message said " card error " .  
1	  I purchased this splitter because it was so inexpensive , but this is truly a case of " you get what you pay for " . The sound quality is so awful it is unusable . I will spend a little more money next time around to get something that actually works .  
1	  The speaker size is only 6 1/3 inches . I have a set of 10 inch PMS speakers and the base speakers , them-selves , are 10 inches . The overall diameter is is 12 inches . These speakers are listed as 12 inches ; that includes their out most diameter , not the size of the speaker . This size is an over rated , less than what is listed .  
2	  I have a pair of SR-60s ( not sure if they were " SR-60i " back then ) for more than 10 years . They 've been through a lot and have had a few minor repairs - nothing a little bit if superglue doesn't fix ! - but they still work and sound good , and are still comfortable on my ears . Having a single pair of headphones last for that long makes them quite a good investment . The cable died ( I fixed it by splicing ) before the headphones . They are relatively easy to fix , because the design is pretty simple . For me , what happened was the metal peg that goes into the rotating headphone holder and holds them on to the headband came out . Simple fix was to put a little bit of superglue into the hole and put the peg back . I have had no other breakage or physical issue , aside from a bit of discoloration of the foam - shows how old they are ! As far as a list of things I like .. * Pretty comfortable ; since they are on-ear and not around-ear , they fit all ear sizes . * They sound great . The bass and everything sounds good . * You can still hear what 's going on around you .. as opposed to earbuds , which kinda render you deaf to the outside world . * They have lasted a really long time ! I am probably going to get a new pair for Christmas ( either by myself or as a gift , not sure which yet ! ) . I highly recommend them .  
2	  I purchased this because I wanted a digital 35 mm slr . I have an older Nikon Coolpix . The lenses from my regular slr work on this new digital model and I was thrilled with that . This camera takes great pictures and is easy to use , actually easier than the Coolpix !  
2	  I 've bought lots of different transmitters . Granted , mostly super cheap ones . And for the price , this transmitter is powerful and reliable , plut it leaves room for something else to be plugged in on top of it . Super handy . Works on nearly any channel you put it on , even overpowering popular radio stations .  
1	  The initial appearance of the case is striking , but , as another reviewer commented , the case is basically a piece of plastic . And , most importantly , the case provides absolutely NO PROTECTION for a unit dropped onto a hard surface . The hard case will not absorb the shock from even a moderate fall where the unit lands on an angle , resulting in a cracked screen ( which is a $ 100 problem ) . My RECOMMENDATION is to purchase a soft case ( Coach makes a good one ) if you intend to be a frequent user of your unit .  
1	  these speakers are not for people who like loud music or plan on hearing their speakers over their subs . had these in for about 3 days , i hated them from day on because they crackled too much when the music is cranked all the way up but now they 're blown and all they do is fart  
1	  I 've had plenty of ear buds in my life , from $ 10 Sony 's , to $ 100 dollar , well , Sony 's , and they all sounded better than these . I got them for free , and I 'm still disappointed . I can't believe they cost almost $ 150 dollars ! Their sound is EXTREMELY dull , they have a base setting , that doesn't produce base . It doesn't matter what kind of music I listened to , it ruined it all . I gave them to my dog as a new play toy . They have ruined my life ( that 's not true , but they are terrible ) .  
1	  Under the technical details it says it , " Includes TI Connect Software CD .. " This is simply not true . All I received was the cable .  
2	  Have purchased two of these , one for my home and one for an audio visual home install i did . Great performance , can't go wrong with this product .  
1	  Pros : Easy to use , great picturesCons : over 3000 meters ( 9800 feet ) can ruin camera . Can't drive the freeway west of Denver ! Owners manual is poor . Camera has no external microphone jack . Can't film from an airplane in turbulence or from a vehicle on a rough road without potentially damaging hard drive . If all you want is to shoot lots of video around home , this is a great camera . However , it is not for the serious outdoors person , and none of the reviews I read talked about that before I bought the camera . Also , there is no map of the features in the owners manual . It has the picture and numbers , but no description ! You have to search through the pages to find where that number is discussed .  
2	  I noticed all the negative feedback after purchasing this remote . I picked it up about a month ago , and have really enjoyed it . Took me all of 10 minutes to figure out how the various setup options worked , had it completely configured in about an hour . Didn't have any trouble with the learning function ( perhaps those that did weren't holding the remotes properly as specified in the manual ) . All my equipment is working perfectly with this remote . Give it a chance , return it if you encounter the problems others are mentioning . Haven't had to change batteries either , or maxed out the memory yet .  
2	  This is darn cheap and this is how it is supposed to be . Why should an HDMI cable cost anything over $ 5 ? I just dont get it - it is manufactured by a machine , just the way others are . This cable is just as good as any of the ones that Monster advertises - i did not see any difference ..  
2	  I think this is great . I live with two roommates and bought this so I could watch TV in my room without needing to crank the volume up which would have bothered my roommates . Now I can watch TV whether I 'm sitting two feet away or laying in bed which is about 9 feet away .  
2	  This card pays for itself with the security of not losing the digital shots you are trying to make . See the following link for some test times $U$ memory card no longer becomes the bottle neck when shooting pics . Nice fast card .  
1	  I read a lot of good reviews for this unit and decided to get one for my self . At first , I liked it ' cause of its compact , easy to use , and good price . But after a week using it , it started locking up and freeze the screen . I could not reset or turn off the unit at all . The only way to get it reset is wait for the battery to run out . It locked up every time I used after that . I 'm returnning it now . I bought this unit from outpost . com and I don't know whether they just only sell defected units over there .  
1	  This camera has had many faults do not buy it .. Condensation operation ALL THE TIME ! Crapped out when we went to Hawaii due to moisture I am assuming  
2	  I have been using Ridata DVD Media for some time now and I recommend this to every one , whose DVD burner supports Ridata / Ritek DVD media . I have used DVD + R / RW and DVD-R formats and they all worked flawlessly on my PC and DVD player . I must say that I have become big fan of Ridata media .  
1	  I bought a hundred , at KMart , for a project that needed done . So I spent the few bux more to buy Sony CD-R 's . I 'm getting a 30 % failure rate . So I hunted around ( spending more and more of my time here .. ) and got ahold of sony per the 800 number . Their position ? ( Other than that fact that the very first thing on their tape is not ' welcome to Sony ' it 's ' If you 've had a failure with A , press one , if you 've had a failure with B , press two , etc ' ) That I should package up and ship my four boxes of Sony off to some PO Box , at MY EXPENSE , and they 'll replace them . Sheesh . Why didn't I just buy Verbatim CD-R 's ( Ive had no problem with those ) or what ever the cheapie brand might be at one of the big chains ( Ive had no problem with those , either ) . So if you 're looking for media , don't shop Kmart , and don't shop Sony . Happy holidays , everyone .  
1	  Cannot review this item since it was received defective from DiscountJungle . It was returned and merchant refused to reimburse shipping charges . They stated that was the chance I had to take . Advice .. not to do business with this merchant .  
1	  i bought one of these dvd players and fell in love with letterbox eliminator and the excellent picture and sound it played several dvds well but then about aweek after owning it it started to severly skip on every dvd old or new so i had amazon send another once again after a few days it started skipping and theres no reason to pay more for a sony and thier ( [ precision drive 3 ) the sonys skipped even more ! i recently bought a zenith thin line dvd player for $ 50 bucks and so far so good its picture and sound is great and it hasnt skipped so aslong as it doesnt severly skip in the future im going to keep it but beware panasonic samsung sony all have 1 thing in common regardless of price they skip the sonys also are very loud and load slowly like an old pc you can count to 10 after hitting play on a sony before it loads then halfway through a movie it skips just like the others shame on sony for selling overpriced dvd players that work no better than a noname brand and shame on samsung for not correcting known problems and continuing to sell defective players on amazon and i wont even shame cybertron they make such awful dvd players i actually pity them lmao i guess when you work for 50 cents a year youre not exactly happy at the factory and the result is a dvd player thats reliable as a square tire ok even at 10 dollars i couldnt recommend the cybertron cause you would have a 10 dollar non working metal box and trying to find customer support for cybertron is like trying to freakin find hoffa ok now lets hope the zenith keeps working well  
2	  works great so far no problems , can charge two devices at once , very convenient , no problems , very good , kool gadget  
1	  I bought this player as a gift for my son , who is crazy for LPs . The first use demonstrated a slow and uneven play speed . After about 10 minutes , the turntable ground to a halt . We can hear the motor straining , but nothing is happening . The company forces the customer to pay shipping , even when the product is under warranty . Amazon needs to stop using this supplier . The Crosley company is well below their standards .  
2	  I 've had these for just over two months now and I have to say they are worth a bit more than what I paid . First off I must admit I 'm no audiophile , but I do listen to a lot of different types of music : electronic , classical , pop , rock , reggae , rap .. Through it all , these headphones have performed superbly . They can get fairly loud ( I usually keep it lowish cause I don't want to lose my hearing ) , and have decent , though not spectacular , bass response . Mids and highs are okay as well . So far they are more durable that a pair of $ 30 sennheiser I bought earlier ( cable sleeves practically fell of that model ) . The only mark against these phones is the short cable .. its only about three feet . That 's great for a player strapped to your arm , or on the belt , but frustrating otherwise . Overall a fine pair of phones for an amazing price .  
2	  These are nice compression-fit battery lugs . They look and perform well on cleaning up poor connection problems that can cause numerous " intermittent " electrical problems .  
2	  Laptop Adapter for Dell Inspiron E1505I 've had the charger for about three weeks and I 've had no problems . As long as you unplug your laptop from AC power when it 's fully charged , there will be no problems . Good product !  
1	  Sorry to put a downer on all these good reviews , but I ordered 4 of these HDMI cables , 1 didn't work at all , and the other 3 showed video on the TV , but the sound was all messed up . I have an LG 1080p TV connected to a HD-DVR and also a Playstation 3 . At first I thought it was the TV since I had just bought it , but then I went to the store and got a proper HDMI cable and it worked like a charm . I know a lot of you guys are probably thinking , since it 's a digital cable , it either all works , or nothing works at all ( common misconception among digital cables ) . But you have to take into consideration bandwidth . These cables probably have a low bandwidth ( the amount of data that can be streamed per second ) , somewhere around 2GB per second . Blu-ray , HD-DVD , and other 1080i / p sources require higher bandwidth ; somewhere around 5Gbps . You can go to Sam 's Club and pick up a decent HDMI cable for under $ 30 , or even get one off Ebay . If you 've invested a couple thousand for a new TV , HD box , and Blu-ray , it 's worth it to throw in the extra $ 50 for a good cable so that you can experience HD in it 's fullest .  
1	  I 've had my Dell Inspiron 1501 for about 5 months and from day one of receiving it the screen locks up and turns various colors . Dell has attempted to repair it 4 times and the repairs have not been sucessful . They refuse to replace the computer and customer service is aweful . So , now I am out of $ 800.00 since it looks like I will just have to buy another computer . I would stay away from this computer and Dell unless you want to throw away money .  
2	  I just bought mine and it works great ! The software is easy to install . I had to download the software updates from adaptec . com to get rid of a couple bugs , but that was painless as well . I was able to get the full 8x writing ability to make an audio cd without any errors .  
2	  I bought this case for my Dad who is retired and does a lot of traveling . He travels by car , plane and cruise ship . The 5-cigar caddy is perfect for these trips as 4-5 cigars is usually how many he 'll smoke on a typical vacation . The case is extremely tough and durable , but also quite compact and light . He loves it and uses it often .  
2	  I purchased the VR2940 for one reason only , and that was to copy all my Old VHS tapes to DVD with Chapter Selection . The end results were outstanding . The final Dvd was clear and it did play in every Dvd player I own ( Pioneer , Sanyo , RCA ) . After reading a few bad reviews I decided to try a few cheap Dvd Media I had ( Memeorex and CompUSA ) . Both completed the burn but they would not play in my Sanyo or RCA but they did play in the Pioneer . I burned exactly the same VHS onto a Verbatim , Ridata and a TDK Dvd Media and they all worked great in all three dvd players . I believe this equipment and software is very sensitive to low quality DVD Media . It takes a few button presses to start the process from VHS to DVD . I cannot comment on the copying from an external source since all my external recording is copied by TIVO . For someone just looking to copy VHS to DVD with chapter selection , this equipment is a great easy way . But only if you use quality DVD media . A great place to do research on quality media is at Club CD Freak ( $U$  
1	  This system has trouble reading Mp3 CD 's as well as commercial audio CD 's . It lacks a shuffle feature for the MP3 's which means you have to listen to 100 mp3 songs on your CD in alphabetical order . It 's definately not what I expected and my expectations were high . I sent it back !  
1	  I bought this printer because of the hp brand name . I 've had two other hp printers and had no real major issues with either . I was looking for an all-in-one sans fax and this one was less than what I planned to spend . I thought " Great " Bad move . More than once did it decide it didn't want to talk to my PC anymore . It would work fine one day and then the next day my computer insisted I did not have a printer . No wires were moved , the printer icon still showed as being an installed printer , and nothing different was done in the process of printing . It just ceased to exist as per my PC . The cheap remedy was reinstalling the software ( I 've learned a long time ago that troubleshooting telephone calls are too expensive and not all that helpful ) . I have had the printer over a year and I have had to reinstall the software three times . Don't let the time fool you ; I rarely use this printer . One bright spot , which seems consistant with the other reviews , is printing photos from a digital camera . When this printer actually decides it wants to print , photos come out very nice . So I will give credit where credit is due . And that 's what saved this printer from becoming a " one star " review . Conclusion : read the reviews , don't trust a brand name all the time , and ( unless you want to print photos at random ) avoid this printer .  
2	  This cable works perfectly fine . Dont waste your money on a cable that costs $ 30 plus when you can buy something just as good for this low cost .. the only people that should be buying those cables are people who don't know that this product exists . If anyone doesn't believe me that cheap cables perform as well as expensive ones , check this out ( done by CNET , a very credible website ) : $U$  
2	  Easy to install . Works fine so far . Only thing I wish they had left out is the little " docking slit " for the power cord .  
2	  I used these to replace the door tweeters in my 350z . They sound great and seem to have a decent range and clarity  
1	  I have purchased and returned two sets of these headphones . The first set overheated and fried itself as soon as the batteries were installed . The second set worked for a little over an hour before developing constant hissing and popping . Also the head band adjuster would not retract on one side , making it impossible to fold them up for storage in the travel bag . I consider the quality of this headset one of the poorest I have ever seen . Even frayed bare wires were visible on one side . I recommend you avoid Taurus products completely .  
1	  I have this camera for 3 years . The image quality is OK , optics are good . Battery life is good . Now 3 years later cameras have bigger displays , but thats not a negative point for this camera as it came out in a time this size was usual . The big bad thing with this camera is its respond time , and this really makes the good things pretty useless . It needs about 1-2 seconds from the moment I hit the shoot button until it actually takes the picture , and I have had so much occasion with peoples , where this ruined the take . Specially with kids , you have a good moment and shoot , but the picture is taken long after the good moment passed away . Also the time the camera needs to save the image after the take is extremely slow , there go other 10 good moments until the cam is ready again . Maybe the save file time can be shortened with a better highspeed flash card , the one I use is a standard card . But it will still be too much time to save the image . I am going now purchasing a Canon Powershot A710 .  
1	  Not recommended unless you enjoy frustrating tinkering ! I have not been able to get the adapter to pair up with my HS820 Motorola headset and while the Bluetooth driver is able to pair up with my Motorola V505 phone , the Motorola phone tools software is unable to communicate with my phone using the Bluetooth connection . I believe the hardware is fine , but the software and user manual are terrible ! Broadcom who is the real manufacturer of this Bluetooth part before IOGear sticks their name on it needs to hire some real software engineers ! For reference , I am running Windows XP .  
1	  The camera has really amazing features . But it also has an outrageously major focus weekness . I made a mistake of buying one .  
1	  I ordered this pair of headphones with microphone so I could talk to my teammates while playing multiplayer games online while using the Roger Wilco software . The set works alright for this purpose . The microphone picks up my voice fairly well . However , attaching the mic to the headset was somewhat difficult , and I thought I would break it in the process ( very tight fit & cheap plastic . ) As for the sound quality , it is adaquate for online gaming , however , they they don't put out very much bass at all . A cheap $ .. pair of headphones can be purchased at any electronics store which will produce a bit better sound quality ( but no microphone . )  
2	  It 's a great product for the price . The sound is much better ( fuller , richer , with less distortion ) than several comparable products we tried .  
1	  I bought this player at Target because it was the cheapest around and I needed to replace a DVD player that was having lots of problems . At first this player worked great , but within a month it started having problems with freezing up , at first I thought it was the DVD .. Now a little over a month later , it skips , freezes , and simply turns itself off while trying to " load " a DVD or in the middle of playing one . This player is going where it belongs , in the garbage !  
2	  The only reason I give these a 4 star rating is due to the instructions . They are only pictures and the pictures apply to multiple different Bose speakers . After spending the time to figure out which picture matched my speakers they went together fine . They are very sturdy and the wobble base is weighted so it won't tip over unless someone purposely tips it over . I do not reccomend them in a house that has small children for that reason . It was easy to assemble especially for me with not much mechanical expertise . Another top quality Bose product .  
2	  I 'd rate myself as being relatively low tech . But I want advanced features available in case I need to access them . This unit is the ideal blend . I started taking great pics right away with very little study or prep . It was easy . And yet , the advanced features are available for situations where I would want to take more time to figure them out .  
2	  The SoundDock is everything I was hopping for and even more ! GREAT sound quality , the only thing that may look bad is the price but it 's totally worth it . Great product and I recommend it a lot . Thanks .  
2	  This modem is the EXACT same one that I was leasing from Comcast at $ 7 a month . Old modem returned and this will pay itself off in 7 months . Once you get it plugged in , call Comcast and tell them that you OWN a new modem ( my rep got confused that this was another one I got from the Comcast store ) . Once they get that straight , give them the MAC address and they will ping it . Also , if your PC is behind a router ( as mine is ) , you will want to plug a laptop or something in directly to the modem line and bypass your router as Comcast will make you do this for testing . Do this ahead of time and you won't have to waste 5 minutes as I did . One last piece of advice , when you return your old modem , GET A RECEIPT that you returned it . I haven't had an issue , but it wouldn't be below Comcast to try to continue to charge you the $ 7 . I should have done this YEARS ago !  
1	  We have these phones . Now I am looking for something else . At least every other week it will cut off a caller when you try to answer the phone . It displays " searching for base . " It doesn't matter if it was in the base to start with or even if you put it back !  
2	  This MP3 player is simply an irresistable buy . It has been about 6 months now , since my purchase , and i was listening to a song today , after i hadn't listened to it for a while , and i told myself that I must tell the public about what a great product this is . If you want even better support ( please visit this site - it will improve your experience with the AJBR tromendously ) .  
2	  So far I 'm very satisfied with this product . I have yet to experience the full capabilities .  
2	  I just received my 2-port usb car charger and am very pleased . The shipping was within a very reasonable time ( especially since it came from China ) and the price was fantastic . I tried it out with my iPhone and it worked well . Way way better than buying a name-brand one ( which probably also comes from China ) for a ton more money .  
1	  this was a joke even for a non geek like me . a waste of money  
1	  Was great while it lasted . The kids were able to use it on their own . The sound and picture quality were fine but after a year it stopped working . The screen kept going in and out and then finally out for good .  
2	  i bought this product hoping to start an appletalk network and have all the computers on that network share a DSL internet connection . IT WORKED ! i love this product , hands down .  
2	  I now own three of these devices , one for every computer in the house . With Windows XP and APC 's included PowerChute software , the device as automatically shut down our computers during power outages just as advertised . Much more frequent the power outages around here are surges and line noise . Some of these are external , but I happen to have a laser printer that draws a lot of current when it wakes up : it used to cause the lights to flicker and occasionally popped the circuit breaker . Now that it 's also plugged in to the APC , everything is happy . The telephone line / Ethernet / coax protection is a nice bonus . Over the years , we lost more electronics to lightning strikes on the phone line than anything else . If you don't have whole-house surge protection on your phone line , this type of protection is a must .  
1	  When considering the Expander , be careful if you have a WRT54GS rather than the WRT54G . I had all the problems described by others , but unfortunately the ' GS ' version adds another level of complexity , probably because the firmware between the " G " and " GS " differs . Even tech support had me try firmware for the " G " version without success . The Expander also introduces another level of complexity if the DHCP Server is disabled on the router because the existing network has its own DHCP server . There is a work around for this problem ( basically setting the TCP / IP to a static address and using 192.168.1 . x settings for IP and Gateway ) , but you 'll never find the explanation in the Linksys database . Installation of the Expander can be almost as difficult as installing a network . Moreover , if you purchased the WRT54GS for added capabilities , you may have purchased 3 pieces ( router , laptop adapter & expander ) that are virtually useless because of the greatly reduced functionality without the necessary range . This review is written after having spent 4 + hours with persistent , friendly , and unsuccessful technical support .  
1	  The DataStor UNBCPX 3-Fan Notebook Cooling Pad is very small ( 12 " x9 " ) , and does not work well for a 15.4 " laptop . I did not see the dimensions when I ordered this , and would hope that they would be posted on your site in the future . It is also very thin , and cheap feeling , but it does work . I would not buy another one of these except for using on a small Netbook . As my wife always says , " you get what you pay for " . JP  
1	  I bought these headphones a few months ago , and until recently , I have been very pleased with them . However , over the past couple of weeks , the sound has been spotty in the right ear . This afternoon the sound shut off completely in the right ear . So while these are fairly nice headphones ( and moderately priced to boot ) , they only lasted me a few months so I do not recommend them to others .  
1	  I purchased this product using recommendations on the Amazon . com site . Upon receiving this product I proceeded to plug in a drive and connect the USB . Discovering that I was receiving no power I proceeded to double-check all of the connections . After about 10 seconds the smell of burning wire caused me to frantically unplug everything as quickly as possible . The power supply began to smoke and spark .. this of course was the end of use of this product . NOW .. returning this product was phase 2 of the nightmare . After waiting 3 to 4 business days for the RMA to be approved just so I was " allowed " to return the product I had to rummage through the return instructions to get the packing and labeling details correct .. and of course it had to be returned within 10 days of the RMA or they would not accept the package or reimburse me . They of course do not reimburse for shipping and they charge an 18 % return fee .. SO in summary , it cost me about 15 dollars in shipping for this $ 25 part which worked for all of about 1 1/2 minutes . ! Calculating my time and effort I took a huge loss . Don't waste your time or effort buying this product .. I replaced it with a cables to go version of the same type with NO problems what so ever . You definitely get what you pay for with this piece of ^ % $ .  
1	  My interest in making stickers led me to buying this product . I visited Avery . com and read the user reviews prior to using to avoid making a mistake that would waste my ink . Printer ink is expensive . The " stickers " which I just purchased do not stick . Sure they take the ink okay , but I could have saved myself the money & printed the image on a piece of paper if I wanted to tape the image to my scrapbook . It 's not like I was using this product on an unrecommended surface . A scrapbook is the featured image on the product . Within 2 hours it curled up and fell off . Maybe I just bought a bad batch . This is possible , but I 'm a broke college student and the price of this product ( not including the cost of the ink I just wasted ) equates to almost 1.5 hours at my job . Never ever again .  
2	  I am very happy with the service and the quality of the product ! I the way we can make buisnes keep on going , i am from M & eacute ; xico and this product is imposible to get it !  
2	  I have had no problems with these DVD + Rs . They are very sleek looking DVDs with little writing . Through research , it appears that Taiyo Yuden has done more to ensure longer life of their products over any other brand , including the major name brand products . I feel confident in using this brand and recommend it for recording and data back-up .  
2	  This a low tech little gadget that don't take up a lot of space and it works !  
1	  My printer died last night . Searching for a solution , I found these posts describing the exact same problem with the carriage . Its very disappointing because I purchased it for the HP name . I used it minimally - not more than 50 printed pages . I would not recommend this product .  
2	  I had a laptop which required me to remove the CD if I wanted a 3.5 inch floppy drive . What a pain ! This external floppy drive pluges into the USB port and I was fully functioanl using CD and floppy drive functions without the cumbersome effort to switch bays . Worked smoothly . Well worth the money the first day .  
2	  I likey . No complaints . Strong and sturdy . Many compartments . Looks good .  
1	  Don't bother . I could get it to work . The manual does not have a troubleshooting section . It only explains how to download the progran . It 's definitely not worth the aggravation . I am returning to the store today .  
2	  It brings things up so close and clear . You can count the leaves on the tree .  
2	  Coupled with the top of the line Denon DVD player , HDCD music and DVD videos sound and look awesome ! I have my 5700 powering four Polk Audio SRT speakers and an PSW1200 sub and LOOK OUT ! It literally can cause my glass tabletop to vibrate , just around 127db ( yes , it 's true ! ) . The only downside is that some movies can cause the receiver to clip ( it safely shuts itself down and you just need to cycle the power ) for particular scenes at moderate-to-high volume levels  
2	  This is my third Toshiba laptop and all have been great . You can bet my next laptop will be another Toshiba .  
1	  I used the micro SD in my new cell phone and it worked once but then it got fried or something cause it stopped working . The larger one didn't work at all . Not happy with it at all .  
2	  My wife and I like this player a lot . The picture is clear , controls are easy to work , and the sound is nice . We only play DVDs . The only flaw is that it doesn't play foreign disks . I 've searched the web for a work-around . There seems not to be one .  
1	  Got this unit for Christmas and have already had trouble . The 12v adaptor feel apart after one day of use . I contacted XACT Communications and it took over 2 weeks to respond back to me . They have horrible customer service and are very rude to deal with . They would rather lose a customer then replace a $ 14.95 part .  
2	  I bought this about 4 years ago , and have never had any real problem other than a paper jam occasionally . It was well worth the $ 80 I spent at Best Buy when it first was marketed . I 'm looking for an ink refill now , so I have faith it will last for some time .  
2	  I had this camera years ago and it was stolen . I repurchased because I liked it so much . I just had my pixs developed and they are great . Marge  
2	  I wanted to be able to play my music elsewhere than just my computer , so I bought this with a rebate awhile back . It worked great and wasn't hard to set up at all . The software was a bit strange . It would allow you to channel sound from your whole computer , or just WMP , or just iTunes , etc . But if you set it to play WMP through this device and then got on your computer a week later and tried to play music in WMP , nothing would come out because it was being channeled through to the device . Caused me some confusion . Anyway , the only reason I didn't like this product is because I couldn't look through my music through it . You can only set up your music player on your computer with playlists or whatever and then just skip tracks through this device . It worked well , no problems with reception , even with a wireless router in the same house . The remote was handy as well . If you want a more full-featured music streamer , check into theLinksys Wireless-B Music System WMLS11B . I bought it a couple weeks ago , and it is SWEET ! You can access all your music from your computer by artist , album , etc . , and you can access hundreds of internet radio stations from the unit ! Wow !  
2	  I bought this backpack 3 1/2 years ago . I have used it to travel overseas to Europe , as a backpack for school carrying heavy books , and carry on luggage to travel to local places . I haven't had any trouble with this but at the only caution I would give is to be careful of the lining in the smaller pockets . It 's easy to rip .  
2	  Great because it prints in b / w or color . And has all extra features of copying faxing , reducing copies , etc . and is super quiet . The only one on the market that is quiet which is good for a home or office environment .  
2	  I purchased one of the earlier models of the C-Pen in the fall of the 2005 while in grad school studying history . I was able to extract info from books and articles using the pen and organize my notes with Inspiration software rapidly and accurately . In addition , when it came time to write reviews or assemble information into a paper , it was very easy to either use a direct quote or paraphrase from selected authors . This was huge advance over the old way to either taking notes by hand or typing notes into a Word document . Never-the-less , the old C-Pen had its drawbacks . The C-Pen 20 goes a long way towards correcting those drawbacks . The simplest fix in my mind is using a USB connector . I no longer have to deal with some of the problems with the serial adapter . In addition , now the pen is always on . In past the auto shut-off almost meant having to re-initialize C-Direct . This was very annoying because it created regular interruptions of reading if I was not continuously using the pen . Having used the C-Pen 20 for three extended sessions of note taking , I find this a great relief . In actual operation , the pen is much easier to use . The pen operates simply with the auto trigger . It is easier to precisely aim the viewing sensor to read text . You can see if the reading light is operating ( it was a mystery before because the head was completely shrouded ) . An audible click sounds when the pen has completed OCR translation , so you know when you can start the next scan . In the past , I would have to watch the screen on the side of the pen as it digested the read text for conversion and download to your software . I find this pen much simpler to use . Maybe the best part of all is that the OCR software is improved . In the past I would estimate that reading accuracy average around 80 % to 90 % . Size and font made a substantial difference . God forbid if there was any underlining . Italics made the old system really slow . So far I have found that the OCR is 95 % to 100 % accurate . It still occasionally stumbles , but it is much , much better . It reads and converts the text much more quickly than in the past . The whole operating system is much more stable as well . The old pen would lock up occasionally , requiring removal of batteries , reinsertion , and re-starting the software . In about 10 hours of operations so far , I have had zero problems . I have never used the old C-Pen unconnected from the computer , so I don't mind being tethered to either my desktop or laptop . This pen really makes extensive textual research and note taking a much more efficient . Again , having the right software to dump the data into is the other half of the battle , but the C-Pen 20 is a great tool , and lives up to the promise of its predecessors .  
2	  I upgraded my stereo system from Acoustmass 6 to Acoustimass 10 series thinking that I will see a significant difference in the quality of sound . I liked the old 6 series system a lot . I find the new 10 series about the same as the previous one I had .  
2	  I HAVE USED THIS PC CORD FOR MORE THAN TWENTY TWO YEARS AND IT HAS NEVER FAILED ME YET . CONTINUE WITH THE GOOD WORK !  
2	  When I first saw the specs on these headphones I was impressed . Never had I seen such a wide frequency response , and having owned Sony headphones before and having been satisfied I ignored the price tag and purchased them . Look , they sound great but you need to use them for a while before you get used to them and before they really begin to sound good . My advise , get them but give them some time !  
1	  My wife bought this at the airport , thinking that it 's size and " Noise cancellation " is a good purchase . She didn't like it and I tried it on my next trip . 1 The so-called " remote " is bulky . The wire running from it to the music player is way too short . I had to hold it in my hand . I have full size Noise cancelling earphones that fold up which works far superior on a plane . 2 The sound is tinny and very low volume . Noise cancellation is at a minimum if at all effective . 3 I lost the soft in ear part of one earbud , which falls off often . I called COBY and was told that they don't sell a replacement part and that I might be able to find a suitable paert at " Radio Shack " or some other electronics store . 4 Very poor support from COBY !  
2	  I don't currently own one of these . I owned one for about 2-3 years with my Canon 40D and really enjoyed it . It got me hooked on primes . After getting a Sigma 30 and Canon 85 , I wasn't using it much and ended up selling it . Over time I gradually wanted it more and more . I purchased one finally and , a few days later , a Canon 5D2 . Not sure what lenses I would want after jumping to full frame , I decided to return the 50 . Some of the shots I got with the 5D2 and this lens in those few days are some of the best I 've gotten from that 5D2 . This , like the other non-L USM primes , is a great value . Now I would love to add one of these or the 50 f / 1.2 . The fact that this lens can be considered next to the L version is a testament to how good this thing is . I have not owned the L , but I have owned the f / 1.8 . I would pick this every day over the f / 1.8 " nifty fifty " variant . This focuses faster and better , has far better build quality ( including the metal mount ) and cleaner bokeh . Not to mention 2/3 stop faster . I would recommend this lens for anyone wanting to get into fast primes who hasn't already . It 's a great general purpose focal length to get a taste of what fast primes are all about .  
1	  I received this product and was initially pleased . However , in only two days of use , the belt clip broke , the front of the case opened on impact , and my iPod fell two feet to the ground . I would not recommend this product to anyone .  
1	  lasted 2 1/2 years . Tv started taking long to turn on . Samsung replaced capacitors even though it was out of warranty . I then told the tech the picture wasn't the same . Next day I noticed 3 lines on right side of TV . Samsung won't repair or replace . Said it is a totally different problem . Well there shouldn't be any problems . No more samsung for me . $ 1600 down the drain . Well after much arguing back and forth with Samsung they sent someone out to look at my TV again . They told me it was a bad panel but they are going to replace . I am thankful they are replacing but a tv should last much longer than 2 1/2 years . Even the tv repair man said if Samsung was not going to cover I should just go buy a new TV . He said a panel replacement can be $ 1000.00  
1	  This wonderful little hunk of junk came to me Dead On Arrival . For the price , I wasn't expecting much so good thing I set my expectations low . So if you choose to gamble on the idea that you 're going to receive a working product , then best of luck to you my friend !  
2	  After testing every available retail mouse , this one proved well worth the extra money . The mouse is far less curved than most , so those with carpal tunnel or other hand ailments will find the flat , easy to move accessory very welcome . I don't game , so can't speak to any of those features , but for word processing use & desk top text manipulation , it 's divine . Contrary to the flashy box , the ' color ' lit mouse is muted & largely unnoticeable ; the lit top wheel actually enhances use , which is ironic since it was one of the features that had me hesitating ! Takes a bit to become accostomed to how quickly the mouse does move the cursor , but since the hand doesn't have to curve around any supposed ergonomic features or grasp anything requiring stress on the thumb , overshooting the mark is no big deal . The carrying case for the mouse is a nice idea , making for easier travelling and storage . All , in all , can't figure out why Best Buy was the only retailer to have the mouse available when this product truly stands alone - only two other gaming mouses in my retail area & both were still too curved for painful fingers . P.S. On-line prices were across the board much less expensive , even with postage figured in - so long as you aren't having a mouse emergency !  
2	  Charges my ipod right away . I like the lock at the charger . It 's easy to put in and take out . I just wish the cord was a bit longer . Overall , it 's a good buy !  
2	  Great antenna for being 65 miles from transmission in St . Louis , MO . We live in a valley and we tilt this antenna and we get all stations except one that has a very low tower transmission . We expected that we would not receive this station until tv station improve their tower . The product was package great and was received on time . We put up this antenna with a channel master 7777 amp . GREAT PRODUCT !  
2	  This is my second Canon camera I have purchased and they simply get better each time . This was a big step-up from a simple point ( wait ) and shoot camera . If you spend the time learning how to use this camera you will be rewarded with great shots to show everybody . Definitely worth the money .  
2	  This is a great ipod speaker system for the price . I looked in stores and couldn't find a system nearly this good for cheaper or even the same price . Sounds great and is super portable . I only have one problem with it and that is this .. I like to put my ipod on shuffle and just let it go . However , when you want to turn this device off completely , you have to slide the on / off button on the BACK BOTTOM of the device . If you simply push the middle button on the top ( which is more accessible ) , all it does is MUTE the music .. the ipod continues to play , you just don't hear it . When I turn the device completely off with the back bottom button and then I want to turn it back on again .. I have to go back into the ipod and choose shuffle again .. so no continuous play . Quite annoying . But since the cost of this was so cheap , I will deal with it .  
1	  The most important feature for me was the ability to display photos and play MP3 's for backround music at the same time . This thing won't do it , and the description led me to believe it would ..  
2	  I got this for Christmas 3-4 yrs ago , and I didn't have one problem with it until last week when the power chip thing got fried . ( I 'm guessing we had a power surge and as it was not grounded , the power thing fried .. ) I tried 2 other dvd players since then and do not like them and am now trying to get another one of these .  
1	  If we hadn't tossed the receipt away , I 'd be taking this product back to the store . If my husband is using his computer ( with a different brand mouse ) , my curser moves all over the screen and clicks on random things . Basically , I am unable to use it at all when my husband is on his PC . If there is a way to change the frequency , I haven't found it . Attempted to contact the Microsoft support , but can't find a product ID on the mouse . The only number there is not the right format . I guess I 'll give this expensive garbage to one of my kids and stick with Logitech .  
2	  I used to own little crappy Dell speakers that came with the computer stock . I had them for a couple years . I finally decided to muster up some money ( I 'm a college student , so I 'm automatically broke ) , and decided to invest in some 2.1 speakers , since 5.1 was a little bit more of an investment , and I didn't feel that I was ready for it anyway . Let me tell you .. these speakers bring life to the whole room . Your day will be made as soon as you crank these puppies up . And for less than 40 bux .. how can that not be a steal ? And don't even let me start on the videogames .. haha !  
2	  PROS : This item would be great for use with a Mac Mini . I use it with my MacBookPro so I don't have to reconnect all my USB items every time I put it back on my desk . Instead of stacking under a Mac Mini , I put it under my 19 " monitor that I use in a dual monitor configuration on my desk . This works very well with a few exceptions . CONS : The included USB and Firewire cords are very short . This would be fine for the Mac Mini , but not so great for my setup . Also , I was disappointed that the Firewire connections are only the slower Firewire 400 , but for the price , I couldn't beat it .  
1	  Use instructions no clear . No explanation for what to expect when used correctly or incorrectly . Might try it later but I doubt it .  
2	  What can I say other than it 's new , in a bag , works and hasn't caused any problems . The price was reasonable too !  
1	  I 've owned and listened to many pairs of headphones - and running with my music is important to me . I was using a pair of Sony in ear buds that I loved the sound quality of , due to them sealing inside the ear canal , but found that during a longer run ( which equals more sweat ) , the right bud would start to slide and unseal itself . Eventually , they gave up the ghost and one ear went quiet . I picked these up expecting them to sit more securely , but also understanding that they wouldn't make the same kind of seal - so wouldn't be quite as good with sound quality . Unfortunately for me , my right ear appears to be slightly larger , or differently formed , to my left ear - these Nike headphones slid out even sooner than my old Sony buds did , and I find that during my run , I 'm pushing it back in , re-seating it , twisting it - and never quite getting it stable . The left ear is rock solid though . I end up taking it off entirely , or turning it upside down and sitting it in my ear like an old school pair of apple headphones do . In fact , my last run , that was exactly what I did . I got an older pair of Apple headphones , they sat inside my ear easily - quality was terrible , they ached later on , but they did not budge for the entire 10 miles . Like my old Sony 's , I do like the extra long cable . When I run with an arm band , I use the short cable - when I run with a hydration pack , I can add the longer cable . I actually added the long cable to the Apple headphones on my last run , as they aren't * quite * long enough . I 'm still hunting for that perfect blend of good audio quality , stable - but comfortable - fitment and resistant to sweat . I think I 'll be checking out the Sennheiser PMX80 's next .  
1	  I feel that this lens seems a lot slower then my others . Since this is not a lens that I must use since I have a better lens at the same focal length I rarely use it . I don't recommend it but others might like it .  
1	  I bought 2 pairs of these headphones as the reviews sounded great overall . I have not had a problem with my 8-year-old daughter 's headphones , but my 5-year-old daughter 's headphones broke within about a month of using them . One side still works but the other side does not . You can wiggle the cord just right sometimes & get the nonworking side to work at times but this is rare . I agree with reviewers who state that the cords are too thin . They do not hold up to a small child . I will purchase different headphones next time .  
1	  Have had zero luck with two of these cables . If you try and remove them from a tight fitting connection , they will separate and the gold plug portion remains in the output , leaving you looking at multiple individual wires and a $ 70 cable that is now worthless .  
1	  I bought one a few months ago and tried to use it to play the DVDs I have . For some DVDsm it plays fine ; but for others , it either fails to start or freezes in the middle of a movies after about 30 minutes - very annoying . Yes , it is cheap . But I have learned it 's a mistake for me to have bought this one . Now , I have to buy another one that really works .  
1	  My daughter received this DVD player Christmas 2005 . It seemed to work just fine for a few months . Then , one day it just seemed to be in an eternal " Loading " position . I bought a name brand DVD lens cleaner to see if that would rectify the problem . It did not . Thus , it is " loading " .  
2	  Alright well , first off , I 'm not Kimberly , but her daughter . I came upon this camcorder for Hanukkah , and I thought it was amazing . Although the zone isn't the best , it 's really easy to record things and easy enough for my friends to figure out . = P I would recomend it to anyone who 's tired of plugging their cameras into a charger time after time , while with the Flip , you only have to replace the batteries , which are AA . I hope you enjoy this product , it 's really great .  
2	  After reading numerous reviews about universal remotes , I decided on the Sony RM-VL900 and couldn't be happier . Even though I do not own all Sony components , the remote controls all the functions of my TV ( Mitsubishi ) , DVD ( Sony ) , Cable Box ( GI ) and Receiver ( Yamaha ) . If there was a function I wanted transferred , the remote " learned " it easilly . The macro function is really great and the main reason I bought this remote . With the touch of 1 button I can turn everything on and start watching instead of fumbling with remotes . When I had trouble programming my cable box , a call to the Sony 800 number solved the problem in a few minutes . ( By the way , it was user error on my part ) . For the price , this remote is a bargain .  
2	  This mouse is great . I love the side scrolling abilities and the two thumb buttons . Everything is put together in a way that always works , I 've never had any trouble with the mouse . It is stylish and fits perfectly in my hand . The laser quality is outstanding , a leap above normal optical . I have the wireless version of this at my house , and it is less reliable . Both because the wireless seems to cause trouble and because it has a few extra buttons that I can't seem to get to work . However this wired one is flawless .  
1	  I got this cable as a replacement for an iPod shuffle , but it doesn't fit . The cable that arrived has a 2.5 mm diameter plug , my iPod shuffle has a 3.5 mm socket . Don't know if seller sent wrong cable or if there are different models of the Apple 's 2nd Generation shuffle .  
2	  I bought these speaker cables because they already have banana plugs at each end . Cable is nice and thick , seems to be built very well . Color is dark blue , looks black in a dark room . I have all my front speakers connected with these cables and my system sounds great . I also like the look , very pro without the expensive price tag .  
1	  I can't use my amazon money .. It want a credit card but i dont have one to give . wow .  
1	  I had hoped to save some cash by purchasing this Aiptek , but it was an absolute horror . Jerky response ; built like junk . I returned it the same day and bought a WACOM Graphire , which works like a dream .  
2	  Arrived on time . Seems like the projector bulbs are what I ordered and they are in good condition . Excllant transaction . I won't know for sure until I actually use the bulbs .  
1	  When was the last time you had a digital clock which couldn't keep time ? Here 's your chance to get one ! It loses several minutes a month . The display can only be read if you are looking head-on ( e.g. no off angle visibility ) . This is probably ok as a radio , but not suitable for use as a clock or clock radio . Sound is OK .  
1	  I 'm not 12 yr old , but its the only way I could write the review without the hassle of registering . Sorry . :-) ProsGood design and interfaceExcellent outdoors performance ( then again , most cameras are ) ConsEats batteries , even 1700 mAh Ni-Mh onesExposure performance is useless indoors and at night , limited by ISO 100/150 onlyThe [ expensive ] street prices don't justify the performanceI tried three other cameras that were capable ISO 400 exposures and the difference was literally night and day . With the flash on , the picture gets washed out ( EV compensation is useless ) , with flash off , the A20 compensates by slowing shutter speed which results in blurry pics ( unless you have a tripod or a rock steady hand ) . All-in-all , Canon has let me down .. big time ! I sincerely expected better from Canon .  
2	  This is my first experience with a GPS nav . system . I was also concerned with the small size and small screen . My wife and I travel in our RV during the summer and this unit was purchased to help reduce the amount of time printing out computer maps . I have been using it around where we live and I know the roads to see how well it would do . I 'm also checking reliability . I 've found the screen is plenty big enough to see the route and the voice prompts are very useful . The unit is amazingly accurate whether I 'm going 20 miles or 100 miles and is usually only a few tens of feet from where I 'm trying to go . This is only true if I input the destination address ; so far I 've not had such good accuracy when I try using the included map . The only difficulty I 've had so far is getting the unit to understand what kind of route I want to use . This is important with a large RV . For instance I 've tryed to command the quickest route from point A to point B. The firmware trys to follow that request by taking interstates , expressways and " city " streets ! Somehow I 've got to get rid of the city streets . All in all this is an excellent navigation system for the money . We love using it . Did I memtion that it speaks at least 6 languages .  
1	  Audio has loud low frequency hum that overpowers your voice on recordings . I installed the unit on 2 different PC 's , tried it with XP , Vista and Windows 7 . Same result on all . The video works , but the audio is completely worthless . Guess I got what I paid for .  
2	  I unhooked my previous D-Link product ( which was so old they didn't support it anymore ) and hooked up this one . After the bried installation process , everything worked perfectly . It seems to be considerably faster but it 's somewhat difficult to quantify . My ROKU works perfectly w / o any hesitation and all my other nodes seem to operate well . I don't believe I see any further range but again , it 's difficult to tell . So far so good ; my son won't be able to try out the live gaming until he comes home from college . I 'd expect this will be the most demanding application .  
2	  I ordered this item for my mother for the holidays . She had purchased another portable cd player from one of those more expensive stores . I helped her get both of them going , and have to say that this one is just as good if not a little better than the pricier one that she has . It was much easier to hook up and figure out how to work . It didn't have all the bells and whistles that just confuse people , and she didn't need them anyway . I recommend this product to anyone needing a really nice portable player with half the headaches of set-up at half the price !  
1	  I ordered the combo ink cartridge package . The black cartridge quit working after one page . I emailed the contact person and it took almost a week before he got back to me . They sent a replacement cartridge and it worked the same as the first . I will not buy from them again .  
1	  I bought Phillips brand hoping to get some reliability . From the start this player was so noisy you had to tune it out to enjoy your movie . Then , after 4 months , the tray refuses to open and close the way it should . You have to push it closed manually and it makes a high pitched noise . If you are even considering purchasing this make and model , I strongly suggest also figuring in the extended warrenty as well , or you 'll end up s . o . l .  
2	  This is by far the most convenient CD / DVD storage system I have ever owned . The stacking feature is a great spacer , and the removable sleeves work great for travel . A simple pop is all it takes to transfer them to the carrying case . Even when full , the design allows users to sort through their collection with the titles easily viewable . The dividers provide a great way to organize the discs ; however , if the writing on the labels is not kept to the outside , it can be slightly difficult to read . The organizer is sturdy and well-built , and the cover easily locks into place to protect the contents . A great buy ! I highly recommend !  
2	  Just purchased a second one for my summer house this time rev . B which is ipv6 ready . the Rev. B seems better then rev . A because it has more features you can enable and it seems to work well . Always remember no matter what revision you have always update to the latest firmware so if you have any problems the update should fix it . But any hows so far no complaints works 100 % fine would defiantly buy another new one if needed . Updated 6/15/12 : This router still works great the range has degraded a bit through the wireless connection but for me if my other AP misbehaves then i turn to this guy for a strong , reliable connection . This router has not let me down yet and I feel happy with this purchase . As with any router ALWAYS , always , always upgrade your firmware because if you are experiencing problems and are not updated then there you go ! Note * : You may encounter some units in the wild that are bad , this is normal as not all technology is perfect and there can be faults but the majority of these routers are fine if you know your technology .  
1	  My complaints are similar to most of those already posted - the biggest being that the computer just shuts down any time I try to use it for anything other than checking email or typing a Word document . I can't even burn a single CD without it turning itself off after getting through one or two songs . And watching movies on the fabulous 16 " screen ? Nope . You won't even get through the opening credits . The thing runs so hot on the bottom forget about even using it on your lap ! I paid way too much money for this thing for it to be this worthless . I will never by another Sony computer and will advise everyone I know not to either . If I could have given this thing a zero star rating I would have .  
2	  The mini messenger bag is perfect . My iPad 2 fits in the protective area with room to spare , and there is also room for a few magazines or a book or two . I also have room for other essentials like pens , keys and my wallet . The one thing that would make this bag perfect would be a padded shoulder strap . Fortunately , I do not carry it for long periods of time . I still gave it an overall 5 stars .  
1	  They must b / c I don't know how they 're all so happy with it . I 'm not going to write a long diatribe here , but I want to caution potential buyers of the e270 . For starters , it 's NOT compatible with Napster To Go nor Y ! Music Unlimited To Go subscription-based services . It is compatible with Rhapsody , but set up is difficult and you MUST HAVE USB 2.0 on your computer . The MTC protocol ( see , I told you it is difficult . . . and I 'm not that technologically savvy ) only works with USB 2.0 , not 1.1 , which I have . Also , it scratches way easily . If you do purchase this product then get a cover for it . The controls are sluggish in terms of moving from one song to the next , but the scroll wheel is pretty cool . I also wish the sound output and the bass response were better . The bass is a little flat for my taste and when you 're in the gym or on a plane , you can hear all sorts of backround noise b / c it isn't loud enough . ( And yes , I went ahead and purchased the Shure earphones for $ 150 and I 'm still not pleased with the sound performance ) . I can't totally trash the player , although I 'm super dissapointed with it . . . especially in light of how much money I spent on it . Customer Support has been great . Quick and responsive . The player design is cool . It 's small , but not to tiny so that the controls are difficult to operate . The scroll wheel is cool and the graphic display is bright and cool looking . Overall , if you 're looking for a player that 's compatible with all of the music to go , subscription-based services , look further than the e270 . If you are cool with paying per song , go with the Nano and itunes . Oh , and who cares about the expansion slot . 6GBs are enough .  
1	  do not buy refurbished mp3 player i bought it thinking it was a better deal but got ripped off mine quit working within a month ! do not buy refurbished  
1	  They gave me this DVD Recorder after it was returned by the previous customer . The previous customer 's invoice was still inside and the unit had scratches and was repacked poorly . I returned it - the unit you get may be the one I returned .  
1	  They may not have the warm , rich sound quality of the HD-555 's , but they are much clearer & more detailed . The problem is with the fit . I understand these are DJ headphones , but these are much tighter ( & heavier ) than you 'd expect . Even at low volumes , using these for as little as 20-30 minutes is enough to give someone a headache . Good sound at a good price ; if you have a head the size of a softball , I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these .  
2	  I got this as a gift from a friend . ( Thanks again , Tara ! ) Mind that i am not from the US , i was worry that the FM radio that came with the package would not able to receives local stations .. Anyhow , everything seems to works fine . It plays the CD nicely , the speaker is average for matches its package price . , i uses my Edifier speakers to listen to Taylor Hicks CD .. , it really shaken up my room .. , Woo ! Overall , this is a good package thats came with a reasonable price . Give it a try if you haven't yet .. ;)  
1	  First of all let me comment upon the good , the function of the device . The earphone sound is fair with the main issue being inability to get it positioned correctly . The microphone is good with clear sound , good placement and great sound isolation . The USB connector was recognized easily and set up without problem in Skype . Unfortunately , the rest is bad . The swivel on the earpiece is annoying , it swiveled into the wrong position often when I tried to put it in and tended not to stay put when I turned my head . The flexible ear hook is a little too wimpy . Sure its comfortable , because its so loose it likes to fall off . Also , although I havent had it long enough to have it fail yet , the cable from the headset to the 2.5mm jack is of the cheap two-wires connected together kind that has failed for me many times in the past . Oh and between the USB connector and the headset there is way too much cord , enough that I taped all the USB cord around the the dongle thing , which is quite large . So to summarize , bad fit , cheap wire , good microphone , USB connector too large and with too much cord .  
1	  Well , I bought these about 8 months ago and I am now searching for a new headset for gaming . This one gives a headache after awhile from the weight and the headset is NOT adjustable size wise . Just one size so make sure you get the right size . The cord gets tangled way to easily and I have given up trying to keep it untangled . Definitely not my favorite .  
1	  The features on this product are very intriguing . Imagine my disappointment when the software provided with the program would not install . WinXP would not recognize the cd-rom . To make matters worse , the documentation was very poorly written and gave almost no guidance as to problem solving . Of course , there was no technical support . In fact , the only way to contact the manufacturer was by snail mail .  
1	  Difficult to focus even when brand new . Jostle it too much and you 'll have to start squinting even more when you use them . In all honesty , however , I didn't expect much from a $ 17 pair of binoculars .  
1	  I am on my second unit in a 60 day period , the first unit went up in about 22 days . I sent back the first unit and Amazon sent me another free of charge , now the new unit has quit also , I am returning it to amazon which now will cost me more money because , the Stinger is 35 days old and I will have to pay a penalty for returning it after 30 days . I can say I don't want another Stinger because neither one really worked any how . Doug from ocean city md  
1	  I ordered this to go with the 80GB Zune that I got my kids for Christmas . Looks neat , but the funny thing is that it WILL NOT WORK WITH THE 80GB ZUNE . I had to return it .  
2	  Tired of the stock iPod earbuds , I decided to get these headphones and I 'm satisfied with the purchase . At first I was a little disappointed in the sound , but after giving it a " burn-in " period they have improved greatly . The sound is very clear and rich , I 'm hearing parts of songs that were inaudible before and enjoying more bass . The only downside is that because they are open headphones they allow exterior sounds to seep in , making it hard to hear some songs in a loud area unless you raise the volume a bit which could damage your hearing . They 're most ideal at home or a quiet area , but good enough to use on the go . In terms of portability the cord is extremely long , but I keep it tied up and have not had any trouble . Overall , they 're great headphones , but be aware that open headphones allow sound to seep in .  
2	  If you 're reading reviews to convince yourself to buy a nano , then be convinced . The only concern would be cost , and it 's worth the money . If you have a wide variety of musical taste , a couple thousand songs you always want on call , and use your nano daily , then get the 8 gig . If you only use an mp3 player for 1-2 hour intervals , and use it sparingly , then the 2 or 4 gig should suffice .  
2	  We have had this radio for two years . We use it in the shower . It usually doesn't get water directly on it from the showerhead .. but has occasionally . It does frequently get splashed and certainly spends most of the time in a very high humidity environment . The battery life is excellent .. we have yet to change the batteries ! The radio reception for AM and FM is better than other larger radios that we have in the house . The volume range is good and it gets very loud for its size with minimal distortion . Overall we are very pleased with this product and would highly recommend it to someone looking for a quality shower radio .. we are even thinking about getting another one to use outside the shower because I frequently " steal " it out of the shower and bring it all sorts of places such as out on the deck or to the kitchen ! Great radio .  
2	  Both at home and in my work , I have the need to copy and move files - some of them with sizes up to a GB . For these occasions , I have purchased a slew of ' key ' , ' thumb ' and ' flash ' drives of various brands , capacities , speeds and sizes and have reviewed a couple of them here on epinions . Some performed better than others - all worked OK - but .. they all felt like added heft on my keyring . So much so , in some instances , that I wound up storing them in desk drawers - and then not having them with me at times when I needed them . What I had REALLY been hoping to find all along , was a device small enough to fit , lightly and unobtrusively , on my key ring with a full GB of storage capacity . I believe that I have finally found such a device and would like to be the first to introduce you to the OCZ Roadster . This review will be as brief and as to-the-point as is the device itself . No space wasted anywhere ! It measures an incredibly ( compared to most others ) small 1 1/8 " X 5/8 " X 3/16 " closed - and opens with plug available to a full length of just under 2 " . It is smaller , in fact , than any of the keys on my keyring ! But is quick and easy to use . The unit comes with a USB 2.0 connecting cable if your plug receptacle is positioned so as to make it necessary . Mine is not , as my ports at the office are right on the front of the CPU and at home they are also easy to reach . The cable is a handy addition if you need it , though . It is , of course , completely Plug and Play , transfers data and photos very quickly and adds literally no noticeable weight or ' heft ' to your key ring ! It seems to me to have achieved a better and more honestly functional version of what we really mean by ' portability ' and makes the perfect thumb drive if anything up to 2GB ( the larger size of the same device ) will meet your data storage and transfer needs . It would be MUCH improved if the ring fitting on it were metal instead of plastic .. I can see it won't last as long as the drive itself . As with all OCZ devices , it comes with a full 3-year warranty .  
2	  Received the product in time and it functions as expected . Overall , a nice decision and a great price here at Amazon !  
2	  I bought this device because travelling in the USA can be extremly stressful . I found to my amazement this is a product that truely works from the time you open the box and start it . However , when installing detailed maps for different states I found that you had to activate it , but you do not recieve any information about this in the scarce documentation that comes within the package . To activate go to preferences , switch map and activate there . Once you have done this I found that it worked extremely well . Even when negotiating the new road contrauctions . Despite this small missunderstanding in the documentation I 'm extremely content .  
1	  Something must have gone wrong that day my Lyra came out of the factory . Great accessory , the FM transmitter i mean . But as of the rest ? Well 3 weeks into it and i had to format it with all my songs in it . First it started with mixing the songs up . Out of the blue while listening to a song suddenly it would play a different tune just for a few seconds and then return playing the first one . Afterwards it got worse it would say " file not found " , get stuck or it wouldn't even start up . Needless to say i consider this as a piece of " great idea gone wrong .. " to put it MILD ..  
2	  It 's very useful ! Who the heck knew that 512 MB could hold so much space ? And it 's so tiny , you will lose it at least once if you aren't careful . But the positives DEFINITELY outweigh the negatives ! I thank goodness and the beautiful and star-lit sky above for it really . I put my AIM / YIM conversations on it , as well as other odds and ends such as porn videos and reviews that I will eventually post here . And for 5 bucks at amazon , this thing is a STEAL ! If you thought this review was even remotely helpful , give me a point ! It 's down there .. just say , " Yes . This review WAS actually helpful ! Hyuck , Hyuck , hyuck ! " / Goofy laughThanks for reading and if I even get one positive vote , then I 've done my job well ! 4 1/2 stars .  
1	  Product was defective-the sensor had a large black spot in all the pictures ( not due to dirt / grease etc ) . Disappointing quality-not what one might expect from a Nikon .  
2	  I purchased 3 of these a few months ago so I could consolidate my CD collection by getting rid of hundreds of jewel cases . These cases have worked great . There are 4 slots on each side of a page so , technically , you could have 4 CD 's on each side of a page ( 8 CD 's if counting front and back ) . I wanted to keep as much of the CD artwork as possible , so I put the CD booklet in the left-hand pocket and the back CD cover ( which usually has the song list ) with the CD in the right-hand pocket . That leaves me with only having 2 CD 's per page ( 4 CD 's if counting front and back ) . If you want to mazimize the number of CD 's you put in the case , you can fit MOST CD booklets along with the CD in a single pocket . Some of the booklets with lots of pages won't allow you to do this , but most will . Also , the back CD covers have to be trimmed to fit into the pocket . My wife does scrapbooking and has a small paper cutter that worked perfectly for this job . I also left open spots sporadically through the albums so that there would be room to add more CD 's over time . I also kept a small supply of jewel cases to use in case I lend a CD out to a friend .  
1	  They mentioned in their product review : " Optically clear , non-reflective film ensures long-lasting , crystal clear screen images " I got tricked into thinking that they have an anti glare film . When i used it , it was a normal screen . Nothing " non reflective " and " optically clear " . Waste of money  
1	  I now have two terastations sitting on the shelf collecting dust . I bought the terastation live 2tb because of the attractive price . I placed the NAS on a 1 gigabit network with a few macs for clients . I reviewed the manuals and the admin interface and optimized for the mac environment as instructed . The resulting , optimized , file transfer speeds were so slow as to be unworkable for anything other than late night backups . After a few days I purchased a readynas ( also through amazon ) and have found this to be a * much * faster system . Definitely consider this issue before you buy .  
1	  The microphone broke after three months . You may buy it thinking you 'll beat the odds and be one of the happy customers who say they 've had good luck with this headset , but beware : I made that mistake . It isn't much of a bargain if you have to replace it in three months .  
1	  This product was purchased as a christmas gift and was a real disappointment when the software that was included did not allow the unit to sync . Sync is the process which allows media to be downloaded from the PC or laptop to the Zune unit . I installed the software on both a desktop PC as well as a laptop PC and the result was the same in that the Zune was never detected by the PC . Both of these PC 's are running microsoft windows XP . Bottom line is that the Zune is not useable which is an extreme disappointment especially for a child who had hoped to receive this for christmas . Therefore , BEWARE when you purchase refurbished electronics as software is tricky and if not up to date can cause problems . I will never purchase refurbished again .  
2	  Great cases , unfortunately they stopped making them . I bought all I could at the time . I hope they start making them again .  
1	  This camera should sell for $ 29.95 at Toy 's R-US . The picture quality even under good lighting conditions and setup to " fine " is terrible . Worse if you use the digital zoom , then the images become unbearably pixelated . Any cell phone camera can take better pictures . No flash , no way to change the date , no shutter or apperture priority , and no programs . You cannot charge the camera unless you connect it to your PC or Laptop , so it 's not even practical for traveling . The menu is limited and hard to use and the manual is a disgrace . In addition , it has poor workmanship and is made of cheap plastic , the cord is made of the cheapest leather and has an ugly brown color . Mine didn't even come in the nice wooden box ! It is not worthy of the Leica name . Don't buy it !  
1	  Bought this for my new desktop and loved it at first . Then due to taking care of my elderly father it sat unused ( but boxed ) for about a year . When I went to hook it back up , there must have been a dozen keys that didn't work anymore . The mouse ( also stored inactive for the same amount of time ) still works fine , but that was an awfully expensive keyboard to get 2 or 3 months of light use out of .  
2	  If you use any sort of earphones or earbuds , and you need to extend the length of the cord , and at the same time also control the volume , this little device is something you can use . A true audiophile might have some issue with it , but for general use , this works like a charm . I use one between my computer and my headphones , and it sounds great on games and music alike . I also use one between my earbuds and mp3 player , again , I cannot complain . Very cost effective and hard to find something better . Note , this will NOT amplify the sound beyond the volume of the source , but can control it within the range of the signal being sent .  
2	  Best bang for the buck . Inexpensive and handles very well . No problems that I have had whatsoever and even overclocks nicely .  
1	  This is the WORST RAID card I have ever purchased . It drops drives left and right . Adaptec has a firmware update , but you have to completely rebuild the arrays to install it ! This card is VERY unreliable . I waited on hold , never speaking to a single soul , for over an hour at Adaptec 's support line . I finally just gave up . I 'm not sure what has happened to Adaptec , but it isn't good in my opinion .  
2	  I bought my e-bookman for one purpose .. To read manuscripts while not at my computer . It works for that just fine . Clickomania is addictive . Bad thing : It is difficult to change the batteries without erasing the programming . I 've gotten around this by using an adapter to plug in ' Frank ' while I switch to fresh cells .  
1	  I have two PCs off a WRT54GS router . I first purchased two PCI speedbooster cards . One works great under Win98 . However , the other card would not work with XP in my other machine . The other I had to eBay for a $ 40 loss . Someone in a tech forum said to try the USB adapter instead if running XP . Well I bought this device and it worked great for two months . Until one morning last week . When I booted up , the piece of # @ $ ! wouldn't find an IP , and the link light was just blinking . No dice in the network config . One day it was working perfectly , and the next day it wasn't . I still can't get it to work , either with the Linksys drivers ( not recommended by many ) OR by XP config . It works fine with my older WinME PII 933 box like the PCI card . Looks like I 'll have to eBay this thing as well for yet another $ 40 loss . NOT VERY HAPPY ! Right now I am dead in the water with that PC . Since Linksys obviously can't get their adapters to work stable with newer systems and operating systems , I 'm switching to Belkin or D-Link . Linksys got the last of my money . If you have a newer system or have custom built a newer system like me or are running XP , beware !  
2	  I recently purchased this wonderful reader about a couple of months ago . I opened the box and plugged it in . I didn't realize how easy it is to use . You push the button on top and a window pops up , then you select transfer images and select a folder then you are pretty much done . It 's that simple ! I was amazed by this product and I payed $ 19.99 at Best Buy for it . I RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE .  
2	  Cheap . Sounds good . Looks goog . Some rust showing after 1 year . No bigge . Be detailed and specific . What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product ? Not too short and not too long . Aim for between 75 and 300 words .  
2	  My husband and I are amateur birdwatchers so I was a bit hesitant to spend close to [ price ] for a pair of binoculars , but on the recommendation of a bird expert , we did . Wow , what a difference ! They 're lightweight , but sturdy , and the stablizer feature effectively holds the image constant . We can clearly see the EYE MOVEMENT of the red-tailed hawks who nest on our property . We have a pair of 16 x 32 Bushnell binoculars ( [ price ] ) and the same image is fuzzy and indistinct . Even though the Bushnells have a higher magnification , the quality of the optics are poor-there is fuzziness around the outside of each of the lens , and it 's impossible to focus to a sharp , clear image to eliminate this . On the other hand , the Canon binoculars are like looking through a freshly cleaned picture window in your living room . The one problem we have with the Canon binoculars is that we own only one pair !  
1	  D-Link is not providing a driver for Windows 7 64 bit operating system . I will not buy another product from D-Link or any other company ( if I can help it ) , that doesn't provide drivers for a new mainstream operating system for relatively recent hardware releases . For the lack of some simple driver software , this hardware is completely useless with Windows 7 . There should be a law !  
2	  Have had the TV for a month now and all is well . Great price , fast delivery and great picture . Anything HD looks amazing , other shows look marginal at best but that can be said about any HD TV . No shows are broadcast in 1080p yet anyways so 720p is just fine . If you 're looking for the best value out there get this TV !  
2	  This card is for my cell phone , it works great ! The price is very low , only took 3 days to deliver to me .  
1	  This thing sucks .. the only reason i gave it two stars is because i finally got it to work on aim and can talk to my gf . The software is horrible ! Buy something else unless your really poor .  
1	  I got these because the low price , good sound quality and they are collapsable . They do all those , they were a good price and good sound but man these are very uncomfortable . They pinch at the eyes and my hair would be caught in them all the time . I stopped using them all together and now they just collect dust .  
1	  It 's not ultra-thin , it doesn't always stay on the surface you want it on , and the decals start to peel , making it look really cheap . It transformed my life in one way : I understood that I spent too much money on junk when I was buying more junk to manage the junk I already had .  
2	  I 've been using a Dymo LabelWriter Twin Turbo for about three years . I accidentally plugged in the wrong type of AC adapter into my USB hub and " poof " my printer blew out . So I ordered a new one . I can tell you that for a small home office environment and postage printing , this printer will do the trick . The latest software synchronizes with your Outlook Contacts so it is " easy breezy " to create address labels for those who are in your Outlook address book . I just received my replacement and there 's a problem with the installation , at least for Windows 7 . The disk that comes with the printer installs the software ( addressing & stamps ) but does NOT install the driver . If you buy this printer and are running Windows 7 here 's what you need to do : Go to Dymo 's Website ( [ .. ] ) and click on " support - drivers & downloads " . From here you can download the latest software AND drivers and you 'll be good to go . If this is a first time installation , don't plug in the USB printer cable until prompted to do so by the software download . So , aside from the installation problem , this is a printer you can count on for the long haul ; provided you don't do something stupid like I did and blow it out with an incorrect AC adapter . :-( LOL !  
2	  I 've had the camera for a month now , and I really enjoy the quality of pictures I 'm able to take , particularly when I lower the ISO and take the picture in RAW format . Very easy to use .  
2	  Very well made cable . I bought two of these and I like them alot . Tripp Lite makes great stuff . Would for sure recommend these .  
2	  I bought this case to transport C-stands for photography lighting on an overseas trip . The case is very sturdy but the strap that holds the lid on just has a simple plastic clip to hold it in place . It would have been better if it had a metal clasp that allowed you to place a padlock on it . To get around this issue , I bought a TSA approved strap with a lock on it and rivetted the strap to the lid and case to create a more secure solution . It held up just fine during the flight , other than the TSA opened the strap and didn't strap it back down tightly again , but that is a whole other story .  
2	  Love this camera . It takes nice pictures and is easy to use . I purchased one for my daughter a few months ago and she loved it . This one is for my use .  
2	  Really simple to use in conjunction with " Iogear GFR201TF USB 2.0 Pocket Memory Card Reader / Writer " that I also purchased . Simply pop it into the enV and it reads it automatically . Then put it in the USB adaptor and your computer should read the files right away . No complaints and having the 2 GB of space feels like such a luxury .  
1	  Roughly $ 6 each for shipping ? That 's not right . I ordered 6 of these and got billed more for shipping than the product . They don't bother to tell you they consider each card an item . Really , how much more does it really cost to ship 6 cards instead of 1 ? ORDER CANCELLED !  
1	  One of our colleagues wanted use this for reducing glare from her monitor . It did reduce glare but at the same time , it reduced visibility and so she could not see the monitor messages well . It was too dark and so it was not useful .  
2	  I tried to order this online from Office Depot but it said they were out of stock . I called their Customer Service number and they said there were some available to pick up at the local store . I got the printer for the 79.23 169.23 - 20 coupon - 70 rebate . So i picked up the printer after work and installed it in less than 2 minutes . It works great and was impressed by the ease and quality of the product . If anyone out there is looking for an inexpensive laser printer .. this is the one to get !  
2	  The purchase was simply quick and speedy . Very satified with purchase and would buy from seller again . The wall mount is very well made and strong . All necessary equipment to apply to TV and wall were included in purchase . No need to go out and buy other equipment to attach to tv and wall . Modern mount in brand new condition . Looks are very nice . Recommended , excellent item .  
1	  We are sending back our 2nd D80 now . The lens keeps coming ' detached ' and won't take pictures . You have to take it off and put it back on again . It works for awhile and then indicates that it is detached . Nikon indicated they never have had this problem before ( despite this being the 2nd incident with us ) . For a very expensive camera - this is quite frustrating .  
1	  FYI .. tried this aluminum case on two different iPODs and it interfered with the cord contact on the USB accessory cable for a 4GB 1st generation Nano and for an 8GB 2nd gen Nano . The plug goes in but not fully , and the slight gap ( due to the hard case ) was enough to prevent an FM adapter from working . Took the Nano out of this aluminum case , used a soft sleeve and it worked perfectly . THEIR description says you don't need to remove it to access the port , but 2 users couldn't make it work . It 's attractive , thought it would give superior protection , but all you can reliably use with it is the earbud cord . Stick with the sleeves .  
1	  I bought this SW about a year ago , AWESOME bass ! I was very impressed with its sound quality . I compared it to much more expensive subs and found that the ASW10-120 outperformed them all , BUT .. about 8 months later , it fried . It was on a 100w receiver that barely got turned up beyond 1/4 volume , but yes , occasionally it got cranked . So I took it to and electronics guru friend of mine who looked it over and and stated that the amp was built with inferior circuits , and that to rebuild it with quality circuits would be worth more than the ASW10-120 if it were brand new . My advise : Do not buy it . Just google ASW10-120 problems . If you think you will not be cranking your sound up very loud then you don't need a sub , but if going to crank it up buy something that can handle the power . Like I said this 120w sub was on a 100w receiver . It didn't last .  
2	  I bought this for my son 's birthday , and he was very excited with it , and I was really happy with the way it sounded . Great sound on AC / DC , Judas Priest , and other heavy rocker 's . Many moons ago when I bought a boom box for myself , the technology back then did not come close to the sound quality of this Sony . A very good product .  
2	  I like to watch vids on my laptop when I cook dinner and clean the kitchen . Unfortunately , some of our kitties chewed the wires on my last set so I wanted something that was sturdy , small and had less " tempting " wires . After doing a lot of online comparison shopping , I decided to give the ' CA-2908 ' speakers a try , based on my needs . These speakers only have one USB connecting cable and another cable connecting the speakers to each other and the lengths are short enough to tuck safely behind my laptop without much showing . The ' 2908 's couldn't be any easier to use : I just plugged the USB cable into my laptop and the driver installed itself . That 's all ! The ' 2908 's have a " mute " switch and " + " and " - " volume controls . There is no EQ control , however , which is one of the reasons I deducted a star in this review The little cabinets are made of hard plastic with tough grills to protect the speakers . The cables are a little thicker than some , which is a plus in a house filled with kitties who love to chew . For their size , the sound quality is amazingly good . No , you 're not going to get the rich bass that adding a little woofer would give you but , when size is at a premium , these speakers deliver adequate bass response . The mids and highs are crisp and I could hear movie dialog clearly from anywhere in the kitchen , even with the faucet and fan running , etc . .. at least , at full volume ! However , a couple more dB of gain would have been a plus and the barely adequate volume is the other reason I 'm rating these speakers with a " 4 " instead of a perfect " 5 " . These speakers come with their own little zippered case : another plus . Over all , I would recommend these to anyone with a need for small speakers with adequate volume and crisp tone but not a lot of room to set them up in . UPDATE : I have lived with these little speakers for about 2 weeks , using them nightly to listen to the streaming vids and DVDs I play to amuse myself while I cook . My original review stands . If they only had a bit more gain .. even just 1 or 2 more dB .. I 'd give them a " 5 " .  
2	  I just run my boat in a small inland lake area , and this is a great buy for my little usage . I only wish it had a config setting to display mph instead of kts . Easy to use , easy to mount ( three self-tapping screws ) , I put mine on in 5 minutes .  
1	  Our family loved the remote at first , but after a couple weeks the remote becomes more of a hassle than it is helpful . It seems to lose it 's programming or just decides not to turn equipment off and on in the proper sequence . If you reprogram it , it will work great for a bit longer , but then starts getting retarded again . We have switched back to the original remotes now .  
2	  I was looking for a basic wheel mouse that would make navigation easy , and be workable in the left hand . This was one of the few I found that met those requirements . It works well , and provides the basic functionality I sought .  
2	  This is what you need if you are looking for a cheap USB flash drives . I have had no problems with the device , and I use it all the days . It is reliable , rugged , small and cheap ( very important )  
2	  Bought this item for less than $ 80 including shipping and handling . Great item so far for its function and price .  
2	  When I decided to buy my own modem to avoid paying $ 7 lease charges to comcast , I was looking for a reasonably good modem . I bought this " used - very good " modem from Miakota ( Amazon Prime ) . There was some apprehension because a number of reviewers had described their difficult experience in registering such modems with comcast . I left the modem plugged in to my cable for a couple of hours and then switched on my PC and browser . I got the comcast self-activation page , filled in the details and the modem was activated within minutes - no hassle , no delay , no long conversations with tech support . Simply awesome ! Update : I am getting 20 Mbps downloads and 5 Mbps upload speeds with this modem - excellent for all my needs ! I connected a netgear router ( WGR 614v8 ) and get the same speeds on wi-fi  
2	  I 've been using radar detectors my whole life .. always the $ 75-$100 range detectors . I didn't know what I was missing . This detector is so sensitive and accurate , it 's amazing . When you get a detection , you have to be careful not to ignore it , because it will pick up the radar quite a bit in advance . I 'm used to a radar detector going off right as you get up on it . Also , as others have noted , the alert is not the annoying sound in other radar detectors , and the spoken voice is very clear . Make SURE you buy directly from Amazon , or else you risk having your warranty not honored .  
2	  Works great in my Nikon D80 . I can get over 2000 jpgs or around 650 raw images on one card . And that is on 10 megapixels . Love SDHC !  
1	  Flash stopped working less than a month after buying , camera was sent to be repaired and fixed . A couple of months later the zoom stopped working again had to pay shipping to get repaired . Now a little over a year camera will not power on at all and is out of warr . My niece has same camera and the shutter button came off and was lost , Canon wants over a hundred dollars to replace it ( 10 cent part ) her camera is now useless also and was used for less than a year .  
2	  I can't believe how easy this was . In about fifteen minutes I had FAST wireless access from my basement to my family room upstairs , where my wireless signal could not reach only minutes earlier . Even though Netgear doesn't list Macs as supported on the box , that 's what I have and it works like a charm with the Airport express in my ibook . I can't imagine an easier solution to extending your wireless signal throughout the house .  
2	  Crisp sound , comfortable , sick-nasty delivery of crazy techno / dubstep remixes . Oh yeah , and arrived next day for 2 day delivery . Just fan-f'in-tastic in every way .  
2	  Overall comments - I have had this about 4 weeks . I am very happy with my decision , after reading other reviews and details , and then adding my experience factors of previous cameras , this was a terrific fit and I was not disappointed after having it and trying it out . whatever camera you buy , make sure what you want it to do , and what it is supposed to do are in sync . megapixels alone do not mean much . pros : - Image stability - read about it in other reports , but believe it ! works great , very happy I decided to pay more to get it , my wife has never quite understood the camera " squeeze " versus " snap " for shutter button . - auto options - the default built in works very well , but if you have some minor variations you want ( like ISO speed change ) , it easily keeps other settings and does the new ISO selection . just what one hopes for in a digital compact ' point and shoot ' camera . - size and weight - just a bit larger and heavier than small compact , but I still consider it compact . yes , carry in your pants or shirt pocket is fine . - eye viewfinder - ALSO chose this SC800 ( 2.5 inch screen ) over others with 3.0 inch screen , as it has the eye viewfinder without screen - terrific for those aging eyes that need glasses to see screen - you don't need the glasses with eye viewfinder , very convenient so many times , I mean who always has their reading glasses with them for picture taking ? and what good is another 0.5 inch screen , if you still don't have your glasses ? - good image resolution options , still cannot get RAW , but can change from 3 or more resolution images , and also change the compression mode for smaller file sizes , all with normal tradeoffs , but at least the options are there for the camera user to decide what is the need of the photo . - snappiness from button to image capture - once taking first picture , there is a pretty quick response on getting the images from button press , my other cameras have had such a long delay , i quite often got a picture that wasn't what I was trying for , especially if people moving around , etc , not in a pose . the first picture after turning camera on , sometimes has a longer delay , i have not yet figured out how to improve that all the time . cons : - the price was a bit more than I was hoping to pay , but after reading other reviews , it contained the features I wanted , since I have all ready had 3 other digitals , I am now a bit fussy . - none other worth mentioning .  
2	  I own this keyboard as well as the Logitech DiNovo . The Microsoft Wireless Entertainment Desktop 7000 is a better deal for the money . The Bluetooth connection is very good and easy to setup . I use this keyboard with my laptops running Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux . For Ubuntu there was no configuration or software needed , it worked right out of the box . The laptop low profile keys on this keyboard are very smooth and relativity quiet . Unlike other Microsoft dramatic ergonomic key layout , this keyboard offers a friendly curved QWERTY key shape . Being a multimedia keyboard , it does offer a selection of multimedia keys also . This keyboard as well as the Logitech DiNovo , has a mouse touchpad on the right hand side however , the mouse touchpad left / right clik keys are found on the left hand side . Due to the mouse touchpad and mouse touchpad key layout , you could just grab the keyboard left and right side and use the touchpad and press its keys with your thumbs . I want to make very clear that the touchpad is an alternative to the mouse , so it has its limitations . I dislike to lift my hand off the keyboard every time I need to move the cursor . For me they built in touchpad is a welcome alternative to a mouse regardless of its limited screen coverage area . You have to slide your finger over the touchpad several times in order to move from one corner to another . Do not try to use this touchpad in Photoshop or a game you will not like it . This is only a screen navigation device not a replacement for a full feature mouse . Another feature that in my opinion makes this keyboard better choice than the Logitech DiNovo is that the batteries are removable . On the DiNovo keyboard the batteries are built in and can't be replaced . So once the built in batteries reach their charging cicle life , you will be left without a keyboard . The rechargeable mouse is perfect since , I am left handed , and this mouse does have a friendly ambidextrous shape . The mouse brings a rechargeable battery , that is also replaceable , and a mouse only AC charging unit . If you are looking for a portable wireless media keyboard I highly recomend this unit . Please note that this keyboard is not a full layout keyboard . If you are looking to replace your desktop computer keyboard and mouse for a wireless unit , I highly recomend the full layout Microsoft Laser Desktop 6000 instead .  
1	  After the driver installed , bootup my XP takes 5 mins , before one half a min . Also Internet connection is fine but can't see other PC ( LAN ) all the time . This min ok , try again , can't connect ..  
2	  really good machine .. voice messages was so good I didn't take my eyes of the road .. recalcilating was excelent .. never got lost  
2	  Purchased for the very occasional viewing of DVD 's - and for playing Jeopardy which we received as a gift . Unit works well , although we had problems with the open / close button on the machine . Amazon was quick to replace it with another . So far , the replaced player is working very nicely . Especially like how compact it is ! For the price , it 's an excellent choice for our needs . Would have rated it 5 stars had we not had the problem with the initial machine .  
2	  I Originally ordered this headset to replace the junky $ 15 ones that i always buy and then either they would break or i blow a speaker or something . Usually would happen about that magical year mark . * The headphones are heavy . After about an hours use i was longing for something a bit lighter and less pressure on my head . Also , the way the ear pieces are made they are very sealing and by that i mean it really feels like its sealing your ears off and for myself , i felt like the ear pieces were putting pressure on my ear drum and very quickly i was growing tired of that feeling . * The mic worked just fine ! No complaints there . I use these headphones for one purpose only - my digital piano . For that use they are great ! If you 're wanting to use this for gaming , i can't honestly recommend it . For the reasons i mentioned above , i really didn't enjoy using these for gaming at all . I also felt like when i was talking on skype or ventrilo , that i was hearing myself talking as if i had swimmers ear or a muffled sound in my ears . That was very annoying and distracting . The speakers have really nice bass on them and for music purposes or maybe just for listening to music or watching movies on a portable divice , they are wonderful . For gaming and using for talking , not so much . These are just one persons observations . Your mileage may very :)  
2	  Great deal on quality Polk speakers .. model is no longer manufactured and seller passed on the savings !  
1	  I 've compared the item to the exact same model in store and they are visually different ( logo wise ) . They cost also They also did not work within 2 days of use . I 'm returning these for a full refund .  
2	  Seagate warranty on external drives is only one year in the US . Two years in the EU . The warranty on their internal drives is five years . Very good product nonetheless . Excellent technical support , too .  
2	  I had trouble getting the first router to work , even after 2 hours on the phone with a Linksys rep . They determined that the router was defective . ( I found out later that it was a problem with my modem , so probably not the router . ) However , Linksys gave me a case number , and Amazon accepted the return and shipped a new router .. all without shipping charges ! I 'm getting great speeds with the new router ( and new modem ) , and the service from Amazon and Linksys was wonderful !  
1	  B / W cartridge works , but printer does not recognize it as a replacement . Color cartridge was unrecognizable , and could not be used . 0 for 2 is not a positive sign for purchasing re-manufactured cartridges .  
1	  After panning these things on sound quality - I realized I left out another important factor . The cord is very poorly designed . As I mentioned in my earlier review , I use the iRiver HP140 . This device comes with a remote ( which is awesome ) . I figured that the " short " cord everybody was talking about would be great for me , because I have a device with a remote and don't need a few extra feet of cord hanging around since the remote stays relatively close to me , even when the unit is in my backpack or jacket . Just one problem . There isn't even enough cord to reach your belt region . I don't know how other people use the remote - but I usually clip mine to my pants right at the waist-line . The cord just misses your waist-line . If you stand perfectly still , you can probably pull it off - but if you begin to walk or even turn your body slightly - you will yank the ear-buds out of your ears . I suppose there are two options : 1 . Use the cord extension supplied ( but this will surely give you WAY too much cord if you are using a remote like I am and only need to reach your waist-line ) . 2 . - clip the remote onto an area of your body above your waist-line . I did this for a day while I was wearing a jacket which had an inside breast pocket . But - the next day I was wearing a tee-shirt and no jacket . What are you supposed to do - clip the remote to your neck ? 6 extra inches would have made all the difference and allowed people to use the " short " cord ( without the extension ) to reach their belt-line - which is where I 'm assuming most people clip their remotes - right ? Poorly done Sony .  
2	  This is a wonderful lens with great features for Macro photography . The image quality probably rivals that of any " brand name " lens . As with most any lens , the fixed focal length provides greater quality than the multipurpose zoom lenses with macro facility . However , the focal length multiplier factor of 1.6 should be remembered when using this lens on most consumer / prosumer DIGITAL cameras . This makes the lens an effective 168mm focal length . Shorter , fixed focal length lenses are available both for traditional SLR cameras and also for digital SLRs . As stated on the Sigma site : " The 70mm focal length gives an equivalent field of view as our popular 105mm macro lens when used on digital SLR cameras with an APS-C size image sensor . "  
1	  This is the third Plantronics that I have purchased . I am quite disappointed in the product . It is very difficult to set up and even after that it does a poor job of amplification and creates a buzz or background . I have tried to adjust each one an am very dissatified . Mike Kidder  
2	  I got this card for my Canon FS 100 . It has enough memory to record memories with my little baby girl . This is why I will give a 5 stars review .  
1	  Yes , the design IS flawed , but not on a usability or conceptual level . The problem is , Rio picked a very bad hard drive to stick in this very sleek unit . Mine never worked . It never got past the Upgrader message , and I wasted time with Rio tech support ( not an 800 number and outsourced to India - so much for an American company ) and finally demanded a refund . The FAQ about the Nitrus suggest hitting the unit to get it to work . Ask yourself if you want to pay about $ 200 for a MP3 player that you have to smack around to get it to work . If you really think you do , I strongly suggest you get a service plan along with the danged thing .  
2	  I went through the effort of writing a lengthy review on this camera , but apparently this site can't ensure the comments get posted , or won't bother to post it . It 's a great camera - way better than the previous models which are quite good . I give the camera 5 stars , and this site 3 stars . Doubt I will bother writing a review again . - annoyed  
2	  Pros : I found this to be a nice accessory with 3 items in a single writing tool . It has a comfortable grip and the tip on the pen is fine which works well for my purposes . Cons : The ink on the plastic near the screw on area to replace pens wears off easily ( I had it a month and it was all worn ) . The plastic is not so nice as the metal pens I got for the same purpose ; but for 9.99 ; Actually I also got a Pilot Dr. Grip with a Pen and Stylus and like it alot better . The switching from pen to stylus to pencil is not that good and sometimes hard to do without having to completely unscrew the barrel !  
2	  Works well ; replacement ink is cheap if you buy non-factory . Cheap to buy . No frills and easy to use . Does the job .  
2	  I was originally planning to build a recessed component shelf in my wall where an old built-in bookcase was , but after discovering that heat ducts behind the wall would prevent me from doing that , I started looking for something like this . I was quite pleased to find this unit , as it 's pretty close to what I was looking for . It 's easy to find entertainment centers that sit on the ground , but not so easy to find a good-looking wall-mounted component shelf system . One warning though : the bottom shelf is MUCH bigger than the top one . I didn't realize this when I ordered it , and the bottom shelf is a bit much for the small space I have the unit in . I 'll be trying to contact Omnimount to see if I can order a shelf that 's the same size as the top one . Other than that , no complaints .  
2	  I 've been very pleased w / this little unit after a month of use now . The ability to plug it into any system and drag-drop is a huge plus for me . I don't like having to install software just to manage a MP3 player . I 've not measured the battery life but it 's impressive . I listen to audio books frequently on it and it starts up mid-track , right where I left off , very nice . The mirror finish front picks up prints etc but they wipe off w / a finger swipe and it hasn't scratched yet , seems durable .  
1	  I purchased and promptly returned a CanoScan LiDE 25 . I was seeking only a basic scanner of good quality that would be relatively simple to operate . This item is low in the Canon line but I guess I assumed the name Canon would assure a high level of quality nevertheless . I was disappointed . The LiDE 25 is a very light weight unit - literally . It is almost toy-like in its construction and it 's capabilities - it produced below par scans for me . I was replacing a mid-line Epson 1670 but the Canon was in an entirely different league and in my opinion is just not a good investment when you realize for a few more dollars you can have one of several other " real " scanners . Not recommended .  
1	  These things are terrible . The cord is stiff and not very pliable . The earbuds have no foam and they broke after less than a week . Don't buy these unless you need something for a day that you 'll throw away . They 're not worth the time to replace them .  
2	  Good unit .. Dollar for Dollar of others I have seen this monitor is the bomb .. I would do it all over again if the need arises .. Very Happy .. :-)  
1	  I purchase this DVD for my wii backup , for first 5 pieces DVD is burn without any problem , and after 5 pieces all burn is failure . The DVD surface likes moon surface , black spot surrounding in anywhere . It 's Very Bad Quality . Complain to Amazon . com , no answer yet .  
1	  This product does not fit the Garmin 330 GPS unit and is therefore useless  
2	  I bought for $ 3.50 works just as well as any expensive HDMI cable out there why waste your money when this works just as well hooked up from my xbox 360 to my 1080 p tv and picture was just as good as the expensive cable i had been switching back and forth between blu-ray and xbox i highly recomend this bargain  
1	  The Kinamax WebCam is a very poor choice . I purchased 5 of them , all create software problems ( under Vista and XP , ) all have audio / driver issues and the video color palette is severely off . For a few dollars more , the Microsoft Live WebCam is a MUCH better solution !  
2	  I did some research on scanners and this seemed to be the best one in its price range . It IS . I 've scanned about a hundred pictures in the 5 months since I bought it , and haven't had any problems . The detail and color on scanned photos are great . The scanner has definitely paid for itself , as I don't have to buy any more kodak picture cds to be able to email photos to relatives . The scanner comes with photo editing software but I prefer adobe photoshop . I recommend this scanner to everyone .  
1	  I have read through the other reviews but they must have been written right after buying the product . The number one rule of reviews is to do it several weeks after buying the product . I own a 6GB zen micro and the 1yr warranty that comes with the product is not enough . Within the first 2 months , I had the same headphone jack problem everyone who owns a micro will have . If you are an average Joe like me who doesn't want to take it apart and tighten whatever may be loose , YOU WILL HAVE TO SEND IT BACK . My micro failed twice after the headphone jack issue and all within the first yr of ownership . The first was the jack , the second time was the firmware issue . I tried several things including downloading the free software online but that didn't help . The player eventually died ( it wouldn't come on ) and it wasn't a battery issue . I had to send it in a second time and I was very upset because it seemed like I barely had time to enjoy my player before I had to send it in to the shop again . The third time my micro failed was 1wk after the warranty was up . Since I was out of warranty , they said I had to pay [ .. ] for service which is almost enough to buy 2 new micros ! Of course I wasn't dumb enough to take that offer . My Micro is still sitting dead and I am not a very happy customer . The reason why I bought the Micro is because I am quite anti-apple . I was looking for a good alternative but I should have waited a little while because now there are so many other options to the I-Pod . DON'T BUY THE MICRO because YOU WILL HAVE AT LEAST THE PHONE JACK ISSUE TO DEAL WITH GUARANTEED . Also , creative products don't last long . I own headphones and speakers by creative and they all died in less than a yr after I bought them brand new from Amazon . A friend of mine sent her micro back twice within one yr and they eventually told her they couldn't fix it so she had to pay for a new one . This isn't a ' hate ' review . The Micro does offer really good features as described in other reviews . It 's just that they should spend more time on R & D; as well as quality and durability . Even though I will never buy an IPod , I have to admit that the IPod is built to last and is rugged . I have several friends with IPods and they have never complained or had to send it back as far as I know . I am going to try the SanDisk Sansa e-series now because I have had other SanDisk falsh products for about 3 yrs now and it still works as well as the first day I bought it .  
1	  This cartridge produces beautiful photos , but don't expect to get much out of it if you plan on printing big projects . I am printing on A4 paper ( 7x11 inch photo ) using premium photo paper in normal mode with approximately 80 % coverage ( there is some text on the photo ) . I only got 12 copies before the " low ink " alert came on . I just about had a fit . I have to print a total of 100 copies , so the cost just for ink is going to be over $ 170.00 . Now I wish I had just ordered the prints instead of printing them myself . Bummer .  
1	  The product included only a 3.5 inch floppy disk for the software download ! What a joke ! Who has floppy disks anymore ? Amazon wouldn't help me so I am struggling through with Panasonic trying to get the software on CD - what a pain !  
2	  This camera just keeps getting better and better the more I learn about it . The 10x optical zoom is great for theme parks and zoo 's and such , or a number of other events and circumstances . Takes great picutres , and is very easy to use . Owners manual is helpful and easy to understand . Highly recommend this camera for anyone who wants seriously excellent personal picutres .  
1	  Beware this is not a name brand lamp . It is a refurbished knock-off . Had to learn hard way after it totally fried my projector and this company won't do anything about it . Don't buy  
2	  This is excellent photo paper . I have created hundreds of perfect quality photos on this paper . It is better paper than many professional photo developers use . I am very highly satisfied .  
2	  It lasts many times longer than the battery that came with my camcorder , but dang , the thing is huge . With it on , my camcorder doesn't fit in my standard case anymore . So I still use the original battery and decided to have this one as the " out all day shooting video " battery . Plus , when you finally do run out of juice , you better plan on charging that thing overnight . It last tons longer than the standard battery , but also takes tons more time to charge . Either way , you should get one . Pretty cheap for an authentic JVC battery too .  
2	  I was a little nervous to buy this flash after reading some comments that it can be slow to charge . I 'm glad I listened to the positive reviews . This flash is powerful , works great , and is not that slow . Using rechargeable NiMH AA batteries , I took just under 200 pictures on a single set of batteries , and they seemed to still be going strong . Flash recharge speed seems to depend on the amount of light in the room . The brighter the flash , the longer it takes to recharge , but it never seems to take more than a few seconds . A guess professionals may need a faster flash , but I don't , and I like the smaller size .  
1	  UPDATE : I 'm changing my original 3-star rating to 1 star , because after I 'd had this battery for only 6 months , it stopped holding a charge ( the original Apple battery worked for more than 2 years ) . Now I have a battery that basically holds its charge for only 1 or 2 minutes before dying when the AC is disconnect it . It 's still under warranty , so I 'm going to return it to Lenmar . SECOND UPDATE ( April 2011 ) : I did return the battery to Lenmar , and they graciously replaced it without a fee ( I think the warranty says they can charge a small fee ) . The replacement battery has performed much better than the first one , and is still going strong after more than a year and a half . ORIGINAL REVIEW : PROS : - The battery fits my 12-inch Powerbook without sticking out - The outer part is made of metal , not plastic - The color is close enough to the color of my Powerbook so that nobody would ever notice a difference - 2 + hours of battery life , depending on how hard I 'm working the computerCONS : - Never lived up to the advertised 4400mAh ( milliamp hour ) capacity . Using two separate programs ( CoconutBattery and MiniBatteryLogger ) I saw that the battery capacity when shipped had a theoretical maximum of 4200mAh , but in reality it hovers more around 3800-3900mAh ( only 89 percent of the advertised capacity ) . On their website , Lenmar recommends cycling the battery a number of times , and I have - it 's been charged and discharged 27 times - and this is all the juice I 'm getting out of it . For the price , I 'm reasonably happy with the performance , but I would probably have been happier if they 'd advertised it as a 3900mAh battery instead of a 4400mAh battery . Typical case of you get what you pay for . I 've owned one other Lenmar battery , for a Canon camera , and it died before the original Canon battery did , so I didn't have terribly high expectations . But I 'm hoping to get a couple of years out of this one . It has 4 green LEDs , not 5 like the Apple battery , but who cares ? I never look at the bottom of my computer anyway .  
1	  This one broke on the 2nd day . Luckily , I took another model with me as well so I wasn't stranded . Ended up buying another one on the plane . I like the all in one feature though .  
1	  Bought this item and it didn't fit in my m675 plug as they pretend . It doesn't have the electrical cord , so If it had fit , I also would have to buy a electrical cord to use the adapter . This is crap .  
2	  I had tried the Phillips Expanium ( ? ) but realized that I had to have one with a display that shows titles , song time , etc . A backlit display at that . I returned the Phillips and did more research and bought the RioVolt . I have had it for a week and updated the firmware right away . Along with many other additional features , it added resume which always knows where it was playing when I turned it off and starts from there next time . The Phillips had this feature but my 262 song CDRW confused it and I never knew where it was going to start . I am very happy with my RioVolt .  
1	  As of this writing , this product IS NOT Vista compatible regardless of what their web site says . TrendNet claims the XP driver also works for Vista . " You just have to plug the board in , turn computer on , let it self install , and then upgrade the driver to the XP driver on install disk that came with it . " When I upgraded the driver to XP , it locked up my computer trying to install it . I thought the first time was a fluke , so cleaned out the registry , and tried it a second time with same results . The desktop is brand new and is not corrupted with other software or hardware . TrendNet 's customer service is borderline rude . They basically try to hang up with you as fast as possible even though your problem is not even close to being solved . The price is nice , but you 'll be wasting your time and money .  
1	  This seemed like a great , simple , inexpensive option for charging my iPod and Droid while driving , and it was .. but only for two days . My iPod stopped registering that it was even plugged in to a charger , and my Droid started popping up with a message about having the wrong battery or something . Dumb . So , my advice is to not buy it . Spend a bit more money and get something that will last .  
1	  I have to ditto the more negative comments here . Got mine and it didn't work . I figured the battery was dead . Waited too long to get a replacement battery . when I figured out the whole unit didn't work , it was past deadline to replace it .  
1	  Run WinXP , sp2 with everything updated . I 've had this router for 6 months . It is the WGT624v3 , firmware updated . I never realized how bad the wireless was on this router until this week - dropped connetion 3 times in 15 minutes today alone , while reading the Amazon . com reviews . My desktop PC 's graphics card went down this past week and I had to RMA it .. so about 10 days to send out and get a return . I have always used a wired connection for my home desktops . The wireless access was a ' it 's there if I need it ' novelty . I started brining my IBM R51 laptop home from work so I could get online , VPN into work , etc .. This is the first time I have used my wireless consistently for more than a hour or so . The last 10 days have been rediculous to say the least . I logged on my first day and lost connection 5-6 times browsing MSN and Yahoo . At first I thought it might be channel interference since 2 other routers in range were using channel 11 . I went ahead and disabled the 108G feature since I had never come close to hitting that speed anyways , and changed the channel .. I used the IBM ThinkVantage software to scan my area for other wireless routers and picked a channel not being used . I changed channels and I verified my signal strength before and after I changed , 95 % signal strength . The connection is still getting dropped randomly . Changed channel to another channel not being used in my area and verified signal strength . No difference . Scanned the networks again using the IBM ThinkVantage software .. theres my router , 97 % signal strength @ 54Mbs . unplugged router , modem , repaired my WINSOCKS with WinsockXP , rebooted PC . I turned on my modem first until is was ready to go , then the router until it was ready , and then my PC ( as per the netgear website ) and yea , no difference in the connections stability . The conection is still getting dropped randomly . I might expect this from a router thats on all the time and is getting tired from constantly being hammered . But I hardly ever used the wireless access ( yes , wireless radio has been OFF ) . After reading these reviews , I am pretty sure the problem wont go away . The part that upsets me the most , I payed premium money for a product that I thought was premium . If this had been priced ( at the time ) at bargain bin prices , I wouldn't of cared .. but it wasn't and i do . The ' you get what you pay for ' saying does not hold true for this product . Buyer Beware .  
1	  I read the reviews that many have written about these cables but I thought they were just kidding and may be a one off thing . But turns out if you do not order from Amazon or any trusted third party you are going to get a knockoff . The item that i received was not from Cables To Go and was not Cat 6 cable either . I ordered for 2 14 Feet ( Black Snugless Cables ) from Amamax . I think I am going to pay more attention to the obvious reviews and then decide about products like this . Dont know why Amazon does not have a control on stuff like this . I have asked for a return hopefully it goes smoothly .  
2	  Since no one had mentioned their experience with Maxtor external drives on the PC , I thought I would add my two cents . I recently purchased the 40gb USB HD from them and it works great . Between my friends and I , we have all had nothing but instant plug and play success in Windows 98 , ME , and 2000 - which I must say is rare for PC products . They don't even include driver disks ; you don't need them ! I don't see why the FireWire option would be much different , assuming you have the correct ports . It 's an excellent buy for so much storage space . If you don't plan on swapping much data and use it more for backups or ghosting as I do , it puts any other medium ( Zip , Jaz , CD-R , Tape ) to shame . Lastly , I would definitely recommend Maxtor products over Buslink , who also makes external HDs . I bought Buslink 's silver portable CD-RW drive and still haven't been able to get it to work in Windows 2000 ( which claimed compatibility on the box ) , and I have given up on their customer service after months of being no help whatsoever .  
1	  The wire in the package are not even close to the stated gauge ratings . the power wire is actually 8 gauge and not 4 gauge . the speaker 12 gauge is actually more like an 16 gauge . No wonder is sold at this price .  
2	  This review is for the Targus TXL617 17 XL Notebook Backpack . For some reason , the roll-on and carry case are also listed for the reviews here . As everyone else has said , this backpack is enormous . It is twice as thick and nearly twice as large as my standard Jansport book backpack , though not very heavy considering its bulk . Unstuffed , it 's about 3.5 " thick at the widest width and ~ 2.5 at the thinnest . The official dimensions as listed by Target are : 15.5 " x 8 " x 20.5 " . The pockets are well-divided into large areas and smaller areas . I especially like the big middle area for thick books and other general , non-paper items . You will not run out of space in this bag . I can fit my laptop , power brick , mouse , a weekend 's worth of clothes , several paperbacks , a toiletry kit , and a pair of tennis shoes without running out of space . The backpack is not free-standing . It also does not have a waterproof " rain skirt " ( bottom area of bag ) though it does look reinforced , in case that is important to you . The laptop compartment is extremely roomy . The actual open pouch for the laptop is held closed by a velcro strap ( I prefer snappable for longer wear value ) . The padding is decent on the sides and bottom , I would obviously avoid dropping the backpack even a couple inches to the floor still . There is zero padding at the top of the backpack where the opening of the laptop pouch is . Theoretically , the velcro strip should keep the laptop from sliding out if you for some reason manage to drop the bag upside down . Still , this may concern some people . The water bottle holder on the side fits a 750ml Camelbak water bottle , and would easily fit a one liter bottle of soda or whatever your choice of beverage is . A nice change from bags that have a " bottle holder " that will barely hold a 16 oz bottle . I am 5'7 " tall and the bag looks very large on my back even when not filled . The shoulder straps are pretty comfortable , but the waist strap ( which I don't like to use ) is annoying against the small of your back . The only option is to unsnap it and let it dangle while you walk . Also , since the photos do not show any picture of it , there is absolutely no channeling for sweat on the back of the backpack . Unlike many other backpacks , such as the Swiss Gear / Wenger line which have raised areas to help prevent the formation of sweat spots on your back from lack of air circulation , the Targus XL has the classic " smooth " quilted back that you see in normal book backpacks . With a laptop of this size , which normally you would intend to fill to a decent level since you are mostly buying it for the additional space , the omission of sweat channels is disappointing . I would not have purchased this bag had I known . ( Targus ' site doesn't have a photo of the back either ) . I have not used this backpack with a roller case , but aside from the top carry handle there is no other place to thread the backpack through roller case handles . This might be a problem if the backpack is very full since it would not allow the backpack to rest fully on the rails of the roller case handles . Regardless , for a sub $ 50 backpack it 's an excellent value and especially great for people who want to just carry one bag for weekend traveling . It will probably also be great for larger / taller people who have to carry several textbooks and their laptop to class .  
2	  For Christmas , I bought 4 different mp3 players . I love this one the most by far . It 's size is perfect . It 's easy to use , easy to put music on , I love it . Too bad I bought it for my son . I thought about keeping it for myself and giving him the one I bought for myself . ;)  
2	  Top-rated by a variety of magazines , the Sharp LL-T19D1H 19 " LCD monitor is the best on the market , for both text and images . It even has a DVI input port , so even though it 's designed for primary use as a PC monitor , it can also display the highest-quality videos . The best thing about teh Sharp is its perfect build quality . A lot of other LCD monitors look and feel cheap once you get over the so-called " style " factor . You tap on those monitors and they feel like they 'll fall apart . Not the Sharp , which will last a long time . Like I mentioned , you can't find fault with the image quality on this monitor , whether you use it for office apps , gaming , or watching DVDs . Color reproduction is esp . excellent here , and the wide viewing angle ( 170 h / v ) is a plus . My eyes are important to me , and I spent way too much time in front of a computer monitor , that 's why I choose the best LCD monitor as my main monitor - and right now it 's this beautiful and high-quality Sharp .  
1	  I do not know which is worse : printer or Samsung customer service . I bought printer at a sale and started experiencing problems soon after . Paper jam , extreme overheating curves paper , malfunctioning for no apparent reason . Finally I called Samsung . Their local authorized service agent admitted printer is a piece of crap , they do not bother to repair , they just replace it . Problem continues . Called Samsung a third time , this time they made me ship to their repair center in California . They only told me to remove cartridges before shipping , which I did . Seventeen days later , I got printer back . Behold , a huge empty cavity inside ! I got on the phone with Samsung : " Oh , that huge space is for the imaging unit , you should have removed the imaging unit before shipping , we do not return imaging unit if you ship it with printer " . But Samsung phone rep failed to tell me that , so it 's not my fault . " Well , we can't ship you another imaging unit because it is a consumable . You need to buy it . " Very irate at this time , I asked Samsung to simply return mine that I shipped with the printer . " Well , we cannot do that , it 's against company policy . We do not return back your consumables " . Incredulous , it 's almost like theft . After lots of frustrating phone calls with no luck , I 've decided not to let this one pass . I have already complained to the Better Business Bureau and my local Consumer Complaints Commission . Next week I am filing a case at the small claims court against Samsung . I will post the outcomes on this forum .  
2	  I really like this hood . It is solidly built , has velvet on the inside to soften the light it allows in , and it really protects your lens .  
2	  Excellent product . I researched many brands and models before I decided onthis one , and I 'm glad I did . It was exactly what my husband wanted . It made the perfect gift . I received it quickly and the price I paidon Amazon was unbeatable .  
1	  Just to get this part out of the way , if you use the Seagate ST650211U-RK 5.0GB USB 2.0 Pocket Hard Drive within its advertised and UNadvertised limits , it works pretty well . That said , what the packaging , fact sheet , and specs do not tell you is that the drive is severely limited compared to other drives . Want to allocate three or more partitions ? Sorry , all you get is two and not the usual four ( three primaries and one extended ) . Want to use something other than FAT32 for your file system ? Sorry again . I bought the drive to carry conveniently two bootable systems , the freeDos included in the Seagate package and Knoppix , a self-configuring Debian Linux distro that boots on just about anything and identifies just about all hardware and networks on its way up . I 'm used to packaging that says that the supported operating systems are Windows and Mac - no Linux - but going unsupported into Linux-land is something I 've just had to get used to . With the machine in Win XP Pro , I plugged in the drive and loaded the Seagate CD . The drive showed up just fine , and the CD let me check out the documentation and install the Toolkit software . I 've got serious gripes about the Toolkit . First , there is no choice about where it loads its stuff ( forced into C :\ Program Files ) . Second , it puts its HTML doc there , too . Third , with no warning or any mention anywhere at all in the doc , it adds a silent startup of the toolkit to the registry at Run , and that brings up Four , there is * no * uninstall and not even an entry in Add / Remove Programs . This is an extremely arrogant installation script . As for repartitioning , I only tried the reasonable : a small FAT16 active boot partition with freeDos and grub , an ext3 Linux partition ( primary ) , and an extended partition with one linux-swap , one ext3 , and one FAT32 as logicals . The BIOS intermittantly finds the drive now . More often than not when I go to the BIOS setup to move the plugged-in Pocket Drive to the top of the priority list , it isn't even on the list . Knoppix gets a different and unknown ID from the drive ( very unusual ) . Win XP finds the drive and allows manipulation of the contents of only one of the two partitions ( logical partition is missing ) . To re-emphasize , for anyone operating the Seagate Pocket within its limitations , it is a good , decently-performing device . But to anyone with even a hint of geekiness , this is an unsatisfactory purchase . I 'll probably be returning mine today .  
1	  I found that the SD500 fits snugly in the original Pentax PTX-L40 case , as offered by J & R. On the Pentax site they show a different case for the L40 , maybe they changed it , but the one shown at J & R is the one I tried - and it has a small pocket for an extra battery and memory card .  
1	  I didn't believe the customer reviews about several of the televisions that are listed on Amazon . com until I became interested in this 50 " Plasma Flat Panel HD Ready TV . I was completely sold on purchasing the television , but something told me to read this items customer reviews , as well as some of the reviews for other televisions that are being sold for dirt cheap . After reading other reviews , I found that all of these items are placed by scammers . They all suggest that you purchase your new television anywhere but within the confines of Amazon . com so that they can guarantee that you AREN'T protected against their scams . In fact , I decided to e-mail David Munchen , who 's selling this television for $ 600 USD ( including taxes , shipping and handling ) . Our conversation was identical to another customer review that I saw posted with a Zenith 60 " Television . Our conversation was as follows : Hi , My name 's Daryl Shaw . I was writing because I saw your ad on Amazon . com . You have 50 " plasma televisions for sale ? I 've just moved into a new place , and I 'm building it from the ground up . I have yet to purchase a television for my home and I would definitely be interested in one of the televisions that you have for sale . How would I go about purchasing this television ? Do you have a number for me to contact you ? Thanks , Daryl ShawHis RESPONSE : Dear sir , The price for the Plasma Tv is 600 USD , the Plasma Tv isbrand new , with all standard accesries .

1	  Was on my way to Best Buy to buy a different entry level camera as a gift but stopped across the street first at Costco to buy a box of AA batteries to include with the gift . Stumbled on this neat little camera and was blown away by the feature set . Ended up buying two - the other was for me since I was looking for a decent smaller camera to take with me on my frequent business trips . After 3 weeks , I finally returned it . I tried to reconcile the fact that it was such a good deal but I just didn't think it met Fuji standards . I think they simply crammed all sorts of features you typically see in much higher end cameras but didn't really maintain the same quality levels . I own a Fuji A400 and a more sophisticated S5100 as well as a couple of nice Olympus cameras and really expected more . The LCD screen is misleading because photos look decent there but wait until you see them on a full size computer screen . The best shots are made using the AUTO mode without zoom and taken in bright daylight . The things that bugged me the most were the zoom , both optical and digital ( too blurry ) , the proprietary battery ( many Fuji 's use AAs which are easy to find in a pinch ) , mandatory software to transfer fotos ( majority of digital cameras are recognized as an external device and behave just like an external drive for easy transfer ) , and the lack of a view finder which would overcome difficulty in seeing the LCD in bright conditions . The features that I really liked are many . Here 's a few worth mentioning . Remember , these are extremely rare in a pocket size camera . First are the super cool variety of shooting modes especially the " Natural & " which takes two shots in sequence , one with and one without flash ( really handy when pesky shadows are around ) . I also had never seen continuous shooting mode options in a small camera . That 's the best way to capture subjects that are ever changing like kids playing , animals , or sports . It also helps to be able to change resolution settings with several to choose from topping off with 6 megapixel . This is a decent starter-trainig camera that will teach a novice how to use many features that are common in more upscale cameras when it comes time to upgrade . Casual users who can tolerate photo quality comparable to disposable cameras will probably not notice any difference . So I would give it to a first time digital user who has limited camera experience . The features are fun to use - just don't expect award winning photos .  
1	  I bought it in winter and it worked great until the hot days came . I don't like to use AC when the room temp is only 70 some degree . But this router doesn't like the temperature . I believe it is heating problem because once you unplug the power for a while and let it cool down , it will start to work , only not more than 1 minutes . Dont waste you money .  
1	  The three color inks are terrible . I never be able to print out any viewable graphics .  
2	  I purchased my 30gb iPod a little under a month ago and have used it extensively ever since . Over the short , but generous time I 've interacted with my iPod , I 've come to notice things I love about it , and some things that irk me , but in the long run , don't take away the value that this iPod holds . Pros : - Navigation is very easy . Menus are available with a flick of the finger and there 's a place for everything and everything is in it 's place . - Storage . With 30gb , I can hold about 7,500 songs . Imagine , hundreds of compact discs stored all in one , small machine . - When I ordered my 30gb video iPod , I was worried about the size . For some reason , I remember it being fairly large [ which it never was , just my imagination ] , so when I actually received it , I was stunned . It 's large enough that photos and videos are good for viewing , but it 's slim and portable enough to slip into your pocket . - Someway , somehow Apple created brilliance in the sync relationship these iPods holds with iTunes . I can't explain , it just does . It does . Upload a CD , a couple songs , whatever and plug your iPod in , and it 's on it . - On topic with iTunes , I love how simple it is to create playlists , several for that matter . - There are many singular features that I take pleasure from my iPod with . * The quality of pictures is surprisingly clear for such a small device . Don't let the size fool you now . It 's slim but does it 's job and a good one at that . * The backlight on the screen is nice and bright and can be set to turn of after various increments of time . * I found the chrome back of the iPod to be an easy , on the run mirror . I 'm sure we females would enjoy that more so . * The look itself is well known throughout the world . Slim , sleek and classy . * I love the fact that I can play games , most times while listening to my music . And being able to purchase other games via iTunes is great . Those games entertain me greatly . Of course , there 's always two sides to most things . And , lo and behold , there are some cons to such a product . Cons : -I found the battery life to be my main one . After reading it can last up to 14 hours and only getting about 4 hours max out of mine , I was a bit dejected but after reading into it more , I realized that is because I do active things on my player such as games and photos . Basically , I guess that 's to be expected . - While this isn't necessarily a ' con ' as much as it is wishful thinking , I really hoped there would be a sleep timer as I find those especially useful . -I dislike the fact that the only way to charge it is through a computer , unless you pay for an adapter , which I haven't just yet and the fact that one isn't included . - Speaking of connecting to the computer , it doesn't recognize my iPod half the time . When I go to disconnect it , my iTunes freezes and my computer won't eject it . I 'm not sure if this is my computer , the player , or both . - On a similar note , my player sometimes gets a mind of it 's own . While it 's pretty much always cooperative , if it 's on a low battery , it takes a while to turn on and when connecting to my computer , it shows various screens and takes about 10 minutes to actually return to normal . - As for scratches , I 've really had none , so far . I would still advise you to invest in a case , as the one included is nothing more than a default one . One thing my iPod is prone to is fingerprints . Those little devils like to stick . Seeing as that 's not anything major and can be corrected with a case , I let it pass . As many cons as it may look like I 've written , I still enjoy my iPod very much and think I made a wise investment . The mechanical glitches I 've encountered don't take away from my iPod , just make it , well , a little more interesting at times . I wouldn't trade it for the world . An iPod essentially is for music . It 's got that and beyond , and that is why I have found it to be wonderful .  
1	  THIS TV SUCKS . I got it 2 months ago and it has broken two times . I am definitly sending it back , it has horrible sound and picture , too .  
2	  As good as other Lithium Ion Batteries that are bought at stores , but at only a fraction of the price .  
2	  My deskjet 960 crapped out after about 4 years , so I needed a new printer . Also , my current living situation is dual-platform - one Mac laptop ( me ; & I do graphic design ) , one PC laptop and one PC desktop - as well as wireless . We needed something that all three computers could work with / print to , and we were hoping to find a wireless printer as well . We were very pleased to find an HP that would fulfill all of those requirements . Set up was fairly easy - as long as you follow the directions ! You have to make sure you set up your wireless network to accept the printer , but again , fairly simple if you follow the directions . ( Don't jump ahead like I did ! ) It is very convenient to set the printer anywhere and just plug it into the wall without worrying about a router or plugging it into a computer . The print quality is very good for color images , even on plain white copy paper . ( I haven't tried printing on better stock , or photo paper , but I assume it would look even better . ) After about a week , I was ready to take the printer back . Some documents just wouldn't print at all and / or would get " stuck " , with all lights blinking on the printer ( typically when trying to print from my design software ) . Also , documents that were over two pages long would just print one page . I was convinced to call HP 's help desk before taking the printer back . David , the tech , was very helpful & knowledgeable about Macs , as well as about the printer ( and ink cartridges ) . To solve the " sticking " issue , go to the HP web site and download the latest driver ( as of today , version 2.7 - the CD that came with the printer had version 2.6 ) . The driver solved the wireless and connectivity issues , and I could print documents regardless of the program . It also seemed to speed up the output . To solve the issue of printing only one page of a multi-page document , go to Page Setup , and change Format for : Any Printer to DeskJet 6800 ; change Paper Size to Letter . In Microsoft Word , you have to change the document template to automatically change the Page Setup , otherwise you will have to manually change it before each document you print . To do that , go to Format > Document . Click the Page Setup Button , and change Format for : Any Printer to DeskJet 6800 ; change Paper Size to Letter . Once you have done that , hit the Default Button . When it asks if you want to change the default settings for the NORMAL template , click YES . ( I haven't figured out how to change this in my design programs , but luckily most of those documents are one page . ) For the money , this is a good printer . I hope it lasts as long as my old printer did ! Note : the reason I only gave this printer four stars is because I haven't had it long enough to know if it will remain consistent over a long period .  
1	  Video cut out randomly from time to time for several seconds . If , while using the first computer , the second computer entered power save mode , switching back to the second computer would not wake it up . Moving mouse or tapping on keyboard would not wake it up . Iogear says this product is not for use with docking stations - a ' feature ' not advertized or noted on their product description . I have returned this product . Otherwise , the product worked well , good video quality , responsive hot key selection .  
1	  I purchased this because of the price but I believe I wasted my money . It is good for small cameras or even a web camera . It did not extend as far as I needed and the handle is very stiff and not easy to use .  
1	  this is a terrible machine . it is the noisiest piece of equipment we have ever purchased . it eats toner . it feeds paper 2 , 3 , 4 or more pieces at a time , especially if copying on reverse side . it goes thru so many motions to print one copy that you almost forget what you were there for . when working from computer it reduces copy to one tiny corner of paper for no reason , in the middle of a run . it is a piece of junk and we will replace it as soon as we can get over the 500 bucks we were ripped off . the only guarantee we can give is that we will NEVER buy an hp item again !  
2	  I like hardware based firewalls .. These things are easy to use and simple to configure . We have them in 3 office locations ; you can also vpn them rather easily ..  
1	  The picture quality is good , but some thing wrong withplayback , it keeps reminding you to clean the head anduse new tape ( even it 's new ) , and the picture is shaking . It happens from time to time , but not always . Software is no use at all for windows2000 . A litle problem with the tape door .  
2	  This packaging of ink is the cheapest I have found . I looked on the Canon web site and they no longer offer this 4-pack any longer . This is a really good buy .  
1	  Hello , peole don't buy this thing BORRING very shakey ! I hated it poor color aand zoom if u want a good CAmera Try jvc products  
2	  I own a graphic design business and we just recently purchased 4 of the 243T Samsung 24 inch flat panel monitors . We can just say this , this is by far the best monitor we have ever used . We cannot find anything wrong with it at all . We can highy recommened it . PS we had tried the Apple 23 inch and while it was very good , in our unanimous opinion , the Samsung still viewed its colors , text and over all picture quality the best .  
1	  we have had so many problems with this printer .. and their product support is awful .. we continually have to shut down our whole system in order for the printer to work .. then after minutes it won't print , we downloaded a new driver , took 8 hours to download , thought that would solve the problem .. not on your life ! never again will we buy another hp ..  
1	  I should have listened to the reviewer who said the motor was noisy . I 'm very disappointed with this cassette player . I like to listen to relaxation tapes at night , and I need to move the unit far away from me just to use it , because otherwise the motor sound is too distracting .  
2	  The ultrasonic part must refer to the part where it so silently at some time when least expected , slips quietly quietly away . Photographers know that no matter what we do , we can only rent a lens cap . It is never a lifetime commitment . They come and go , unknown , like the geese . Good to have a back up . DO not feel you are disloyal to your lens cap in keeping a back up . IN fact it is the lens cap which is first disloyal unto you . Ultrasonic ? Disappears quietlyas far as disks go , I would prefer a singingPro Classic Frisbee-w / U-Flexor a hummingDiscraft 175g Glow Psycho Ultra-Star Ultimate Disc , which at least I can hear as they fly off , and tell me where they go . This ultrasonic stuff I cannot follow , but like Leatherstockings in the night , creeps away silently on cat 's paws . Who needs a lens cap anyway , all the clumsy fumbling to remove it for that quick and instant and unrepeatable image , and then the fumbling to replace it , only to find it mysteriously gone . . . lens caps , fly by nighters , we only rent them , we do not keep them forever . . . better get two  
2	  I ordered this product and received it in less than a week and I didn't even have to pay shipping for this . Per the Canon website , they would charge you $ 16 for this and here it 's only $ 4.60 . I wouldn't personally care if it said Canon on it or not but for those that do , mine says it 's Canon and more importantly , it works !  
2	  HP Pavilion a810n ( ready to ship version of the a850e series ) Factory Specs : Processor : AMD Athlon 64 3300 + processor ( 2.40GHz ) OS : Windows XP Home SP2Memory : 512MB DDR PC3200Graphics card : Integrated SiS Mirage2 Graphics with 128MB shared video memoryHard drive : 160GB Ultra DMA [ gigabyte is defined as 1,000,000,000 bytes , accessible capacity may vary ] Primary CD / DVD drive : Double Layer DVDR / RW drive with CD writer capabilitiesSecondary CD / DVD drive : CD-ROMMemory slots : 2 DIMM ( one available ) Front-access ports : 9-in-1 memory card reader ; 3 USB 2.0 ports ; 1 FireWire ( IEE 1394 ) port ; microphone / headphone / line-inCommunications : Integrated 10/100Base-T network interface ; 56K fax / modemSound : Integrated audioA couple of things about the factory specs : - With the factory setting ( 128MB shared video memory ) and no additional RAM installed you are actually working with 384MB of RAM right out of the box . You can however enter the BIOS and change the video memory to 64MB or 32MB to free up some RAM . - The 160GB hard drive is actually partitioned , one drive ( C ) is actually 142GB and obviously is the main partition where all your files will be managed , and the other drive ( D ) 6.06GB and is locked and contains all the factory reformat files , this way HP ( as many other companies do ) can save money and not actually send you a factory recovery disk . Now how 142 + 6.06 = 160GB is obviously PC maker new math and is why they add accessible capacity may vary to the system specs . I used it as it came out of the box for a while ( 1 + week ) and my initial impression was that even with using it at the factory configuration of 384MB of RAM it was much faster than my old Athlon 1300 + with 768MB of RAM ( which granted isn't very hard ) . The first thing that you notice about it is how incredibly quiet it is , you turn it on and if there weren't lights on the front you would honestly think that it wasn't running , and it 's not that it doesn't have fans , it does indeed have two , one on the CPU cooler and one on the rear of the case ( inside ) . I ran very intensive program combinations ( i.e. Adobe Photoshop + Trillian 3 Pro ( which oddly enough is a memory hog ) + Excel , Word , Outlook 2003 ) with no sign of stutter what so ever . I even traded up the old Microsoft keyboard I was using in favor of the new quiet key keyboard that came with the PC . Pros : - Quiet ( Very quiet ) - 64 bit processor - Double layer DVD burner ( does not include the LightScribe HP DVD burner ) - Price ( sub $ 700 system after rebates ) - Interesting bunch of included software including a DVD authoring / editing program , MSN Money 2005 ( OEM ) , Quicken - 7 total USB 2 ports ( 4 back , 3 front ) - 2 FireWire ports ( 1 front , 1 back ) - 9 in 1 memory card reader is very convenient - Sound is very decent ( but that could be attributed to my Bose MediaMate Speakers ) - Integrated video card performs better than expected playing newer games , with no stutterCons : - 128MB of shared video memory , I don't understand why PC makers don't just place a chip of memory the size of the " shared " video memory into one of the DIMM slots .. it isn't going to break the bank . - Integrated video - Integrated audio - Slathering of HP specific drivers / programs preinstalled - Mail-in rebate .. if you are planning on giving money back just do it - when will companies realize that if they just take money off at the time of purchase they will indeed be saving money by not having to hire an outside firm to handle the rebates - Secondary drive is a CD-ROM only ; in my opinion another DVD ( plain with no writing ability ) is more user friendlyMy upgrades and would suggest to anyone : Add another 512MB PC3200 DDR Ram to make a total of 1GB and replace the onboard graphic with a card like a 128MB Video Card GeForce FX 5200 .  
2	  I 've had this thing for for a month now , and it is great . It doesn't play . avi files , but it may work with a different encoding . MPG 'S and mp3 's work good , and pictures show up clearer that the way they were on your computer . The surround sound is great for DVD 's , but u only get the front 2 speakers for cd 's . The best part of it is the subwoofer . You can really feel it with audio cd 's and dvd 's . Overall , its a great buy for the price .  
2	  the c330 is a wonderful camera and i would advice anyone to buy it , so far ive taken some good pics and if ur using xp you dont even need the cd that it comes with . the one draw back is the screen could have been bigger its only 1.5 inches  
2	  I purchased this TV on May 21 . I felt like I got a smoking deal since I got free shipping and paid no sales tax but shipping took quite a bit longer than Amazon estimated due to the fact that once Eagle trucking received it , they made me wait an extra week for them to bring it to my house . Small problem considering the shipping was free . I was very impressed with the picture quality and features for the price . That is until the lamp unit failed last week after only two months of normal use . The TV suddenly began having problems turning on . The LED lights on the front indicated a lamp problem . I called Toshiba and they offered to mail me a replacement lamp unit without question ( lamp warranty is one year and they are user replaceable ) . They said it would take five business days but I actually got it today after only three business days . I installed the lamp and the TV now works perfectly again . My only hope is that this does not repeat itself in another two months . Depending on who you believe , these lamps are supposed to last anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 hours but a quick Internet search told me that Toshiba has had a continuing problem with their lamps failing prematurely . I recommend this TV if you can get a good deal on it but I wish I 'd purchased the extended warranty .

1	  Although I have been able to connect via Blue Tooth , using the Trendware Adapter , and transfer pictures from my 3650 to me PC , the Trendware device does not appear to work with the Nokia PCSuite software which allows transfer of address information ( business cards ) etc . I have tried to find out if the Trendware device is SPP compatible ( required for PCSuite ) but found their Technical Support web site to be down .

2	  Gave this to a new 1st grade teacher and she was so excited she screamed ! Now she tells me the whole day is streamlined as the children aren't constantly trying to sharpen pencils with the old , dull wall sharpener . Great great purchase ! Works extremely well . Stops when the pencil is perfectly pointed . She LOVES it !  
1	  I 've had a pair of Sony in-ear noise reduction headphones for a year and a half , and recently the left ear wire jolted loose ( due to improper handling on the user 's part ) . I turned to my fellow reviewers and decided on these cheaper Koss Plugs . This is a mistake . I 'm now used to the true sound isolation of Sony 's in-ear headphones ( Sony MDR-EX71SL Fontopia In-The-Ear Headphones ( Black ) ) , as well as their rich sound output , including solid bass response that doesn't EVER static out . I don't listen to heavy bass , and I don't have to tweak my equalizer in my media player , but when I tried to get everything , from music to speech , to sound natural and rich through the Koss headphones , I got static at normal volume . As for sound isolation , the Sony headphones eat this pair alive . I immediately packed these sub-standard headphones into their cheap packaging and sent them right back to Amazon , then ordered the real deal . Sorry if I step on any toes , but this pair needs to grow a pair to compete with the MDR 's .  
1	  Not happy at all with this product , I expected more from CISCO . It is not possible to use this camera for outside viewing unless it is in low light conditions . The motion detection is very unreliable , works maybe 50 % of the time . The camera runs extremely warm ( no ventilation ) and needs bounced often . It is on its way back to Amazon soon . This camera is not ready for the market , I rate it a do not buy !  
2	  Before purchasing this lens , I had the Nikon 55 - 200mm zoom lens for my Nikon D50 . It is a high quality and versatile lens , but there were times where I would have liked to have had greater magnification . When I looked at the 70 - 300mm zoom , I thought , this is it .. I 've had the 70 - 300 mm lens for two weeks and it is a great lens . It has taken me awhile to get used to its quirks . It isn't completely automatic like the 55 - 200 mm zoom . There is a manual focus ring that even in M / A mode needs to be set , so you need to compose a shot very carefully if the image isn't at infinity , but once mastered , the image quality is superb .  
2	  My company has purchased several software packages for doing our business cards and letterhead . Business Card Factory Deluxe is the best of the lot . It is also the only one we have seen to include a written manual . Keep in mind that with all these packages you will not be able to use 95 % of what is included . It is the other 5 % that counts .  
2	  I purchased the Microsoft lifecam to replace a 3 year old Logitech . The Microsoft has an excellent picture as well as great sound transmission . We use it to talk to overseas relatives and it has the same audio quality as talking on a phone . Great cam for the money . Would recommend to anyone looking for a quality , reasonably priced cam .  
2	  I brought this screen for my husband for a Christmas present . First of all , make sure you get the measurements correct that you need . You will need to know the case size so that it will fit in the space you will be showing the screen . This was one of the mistakes we made , we did not consider the case size , just the screen size . We love the screen , the one BIG problem we had was when the item was shipped to us it was not packed well to protect the brackets from being broken . I had to order th is screen 3 times and all 3 times they were broken in the same space . Amazon . com had to recall the item , stop selling it until they did a investigation on why this item is being delivered broken every time it 's shipped . So after 4 days they put the item back in stocked to be purchased , but they never contacted me to let me know the results of their research . This is the only problem you may encounter , the packing of the items does not secure the brackets . Other than that , if you can get it home in one piece , the screen is AWESOME . We had friends over for the superbowl and they loved it .  
1	  Creative 's Nomad Jukebox 's are garbage . I 've had my player for less than a year and it just stopped being functional for the second time . The thing is not built to last more than a few months . I don't like apple but better to buy an ipod than throw money away on this .  
1	  The Power 2000 line of chargers have been woefully awful in my experience . My first one worked for a while , then suddenly the batteries would not hold a charge . This was already a bad sign , since NiMH batteris are supposed to be long-life . Because I liked its compact size for travel , I decided to give this charger one more try . I purchased a current model , the Power 2000 XP-333 . Several hours after inserting the batteries properly and plugging the unit in , I noticed a burning electrical smell . When I traced the odor back to the new charger , I of course unplugged it and nearly burnt myself on the batteries , which were scorchingly hot . I fear they might have burst or started a fire had I left them in the charger any longer . There are too many other dependable charger makers - why take a chance on this unreliable , dangerous product ? This product should be rated zero stars - it 's earned a skull & crossbones warning in my opinion !  
2	  This is only great for convenience . You should still need to keep track of all your passwords in case your PC crashed or your hard drive dies . The biggest drawback I see is that this does not work with Netscape . Geez , I wonder why .. It also does not work with password protected excel spreadsheets . It 's great for logging into websites as long as you don't mind using Microsfot Internet Explorer . The Quicklink feature is very nice too . If you set up a quicklink to sign you into a website that requires a userid and password , this will be a great tool to have . All you have to do is let the reader read your fingerprint , at which point a menu with all your quicklinks appears on the bottom right screen and you just click on the quicklink that you want and it will automatically load IE and signs you into the designated website .  
1	  Try calling amazon for service on something you bought .. good luck .. this item doesn't come with a cord to connect to your computer , and it needs a special one that amazon doesn't offer . I 'm rating amazon more than the product , since I can't even get the product to work .. poor customer service and product control .. I 'd advise to buy this product somewhere else that at least supplies you with a cord to get started .. or at least offers one !  
2	  Loving it so far , still waiting to go on a trip to add more details , so far , a very good storage bag for camera .  
2	  The Zune came packaged very nicely . I love it , its easy to use . It was also shipped pretty fast in the mail . Thank you .  
1	  I purchased this Palm Z22 August 16 , 2007 and it worked great until today December 4 , 2007 when it just stopped working without any obvious reason . If anyone knows how to diagnose problems or get support from Palm please attach your review to this one . Thanks in advance .  
2	  For the price I don't think the sound can be beat . I wanted one to listen to while playing tennis outside and it works perfectly . When the volume is low though , there is a lot of hissing . And sometimes it has troubles with basic function . I 'll press the power button sometimes and it won't turn on , or press the ipod button and it won't register it . Other than that it 's a great boombox .  
1	  Worked great for about a week , then i seemed to get an average of 12 telemarketing calls a day  
2	  This TVs a great buy - search for a price on the web and you 'll hit some better deals too . Had a Sony LCD ( KLVS32A10 ) earlier which I returned and got this Samsung instead . Did a lot of research to come to that conclusion . Picture 's great even when you dont have High definition feed . The blue light that the other reviewer is mentioning may seem cool for a lot of people . I like it and the TVs overall sleek design goes with it . Highly recommended TV !  
1	  My boss and I both purchased this keyboard about 5 months ago and I am already on here shopping for a new keyboard .. I loved the design of this keyboard and have enjoyed using it , but some of the keys have quit working for no apparent reason .. We popped the keys off to see if something had fallen under the key and to see if something had been spilt on it , but nothing was apparent .. My boss has also had problems with hers .. After about 3 months of use the lettering on the keys started wearing off .. To sum up , the design of the keyboard is awesome , but the quality of this product is pathetic ..  
2	  I was looking for a small lightweight tripod to take with me on my travels ; so that I could take pics without having to keep asking passing by strangers . This fits the bill perfectly . It seems well made and is very lightweight . It seems a great deal for $ 25 . Also it comes with a carrying bag . The tripod is short , it comes up to my waist . But it still takes perfect pics from that low angle . I have to bend down to line the pic up , but as I am only taking occasional pics it is not an annoyance . I was trying to decide between this and the taller model up . I am glad I went with this , because I wanted something ultra small to carry around .  
1	  I bought this and not a month later , it was broken . I treated it with care but something went wrong . It would never center in games yet the stick was dead on center and if you moved it , it would read something different and go the opposite way . I reset it and synced it but nothing worked . It worked great when it was working but the build quality is poor . Not a surprise since it 's from China . The older joystick I used was played on for 3 years without a hitch and I bought it used from a kid at school . That was a logitec but I forgot the name but it 's out of production .  
2	  it was really easy to set up . The fax , scanner and copier areall simppe to use . The software worked great with both themac and the pc in my house . Copy looks great as do the recent pix I printed  
2	  so far , i am very pleased with the performence of this scanner . i have yet to explore all the options that are available , but i have turned numerous color prints of my travels into 1024x768 size wallpapers for my computer .  
2	  This is the rebadged Mogo , which fits the standard PCMCIA slot . A satisfying product if you have that slot , integrated Bluetooth , and a dislike for the pencil eraser or touchpad . Battery life , connection reliability , " feel " , and solidity are all superb . The free Pointix software enables excellent scrolling despite the lack of the center wheel . If there were ten stars I 'd give this elegant product all of them !  
1	  I just returned from a repeat air trip to England , and was hoping for a more restful ( read that more sleep with fewer distractions from crying children and the coughing lady in the next seat ) trip through the use of these Philips headphones . I found that the noise cancelling feature did decrease the droning ambient sounds to a somewhat helpful extent . Other cabin sounds were still intrusive . The sound quality did not seem much better than the airline-supplied headset and the product seems to be quite cheaply made . My biggest concerns were : 1 ) That the headphone pads had to be positioned carefully to derive any benefit from the noise canceling feature , which meant that I had to keep my head straight to not push on the neckband . Also , my neck pillow tended to push on the neckband and degrade performance . Bother . 2 ) My ( admittedly generous ) auricles just plain hurt after a few hours of use , and I had to take the headset off . I did buy a pair of noise-cancelling earbuds to address these two issues , and this approach has worked well . For instance , consider one of the Sure earbuds .  
1	  I bought this to add a couple extra USB outlets to my new Toshiba Laptop .. It will not plug n enough to connect in the slot .. Do not buy if you have a new laptop as it will not go far enough into the slot to make connections .. I am a computer tech who builds systems and networks , not a computer beginner .  
2	  I bought this at walmart with a small cloth . I used it on a practically new xbox 360 game that my xbox scratched . After applying a few times , I did get it to work . Like any scratch fixing product it is slightly abrasive , because it needs to sand down the existing scratches and fill them in with wax . If you want it to work , follow the directions ! Place the DVD on a flat surface and apply the product with heavy pressure ( and I mean a lot ! I pressed as hard as I could ) . Essentially you are polishing the disc . It should fill in large scratches and most likely leave very slight scratches . I didn't notice a haze , however xbox games are already not quite a silver color .  
2	  Ordered this for my husband as a gift after online research . So far it works great , it took him a couple hours to set it up with HDTV , DVD , TIVO etc . Everything worked great and also easier to fix when different setting on the receiver etc get " out of sync " .  
2	  I ordered a 25ft and a 10ft cable directly from amazon . com and not another seller and got exactly what was shown . The cables along with a new Linksys Cisco E3000 router have allowed me to use my Charter cable internet to it 's maximum . I just checked and I am running at 1.0 Gbps  
1	  I want to like this keyboard and overall I think it has a very nice feel . But the space key is very difficult to press down . Hunting through reviews , I noticed quite a few complaints about this ( some reviews going back to 2007 ) and Im guessing that some of the keyboards have the problem some dont - luck of the draw . Regardless we all know what a keyboard should feel like ( and if MS puts an ergonomic on the box I expect it to feel better than that ) , also this problem has been around for over a year and they are still shipping keyboards with the problem . A design flaw with the keyboard and a inability to manage quality in the MS hardware group .  
1	  I knew in advance that these would have a bad optic quality ( because of the price ) , but I have an old scope lying around that has this strange eyepiece size , and I wanted to use it without an adapter . I thought they I could at least use them from time to time , but I was wrong . The optic quality is so bad that I do not know why I still keep it .  
1	  Out of the box it didnt work in a vehicle entertainment system or on a TV inside . Dont waste the $ .  
1	  I purchased 3 pairs of these 8 " speakers , 2 pairs of 6.5 and 1 pair of 4 " water proof . All of these speakers are for my basement remodel . I purchased them in March and just got to installing them now ( September ) . I opened the first box of 8 " speakers and one of the speakers has a hole . I contacted the manufacture and requested warranty service this is the response from support @ pyleaudio . com : " This is considered cosmetic wear , it will not affect the performance of the speaker . We would suggest either a small patch or a durable tape to cover the hole . We would only replace it providing the speaker was blown or unable to produce sound . " So I hooked the speaker up and the speaker makes a hideous rattle sound on every bass note . I contacted support again and told them of the situation and have received no response , obviously they have chosen not to stand behind their product . In the mean time I choose to set that speaker aside and use a speaker from one of the other boxes . While the replacement speaker is intact the sound is distorted even at low levels . I have a custom built recording studio as part of my basement remodel and these speakers where to be used as monitors so they did not have to be of outstanding , but I expected to at least be able to hear the music with some semblance of clarity . Bottom line , these speakers are of very poor quality and the manufacturer will not honor their own warranty .  
1	  My husband bought this item to work with our Tivo and it doesn't work with it .  
2	  Muy buen sonido , tamano compacto y practico . Grandes prestaciones de audio . Precio destacado . Muy satisfecho . Lo recomende a mis amigos . Gracias .  
1	  The instructions are extremely poor . The first step includes a screen shot from a program that is not necessary or included with the product . It seemed to require that I hard code my IP address , which then makes my PC incompatible with my internet provider . I 'm sure I could have worked out the network settings , or spent some time on the phone with tech support . Instead , I decided that any product that couldn't by installed in less than 3 hours by a Computer Science and a Computer Engineering major probably needed to go back to the store . Before you buy this , decide how much of your time wireless printing is really worth .. and whether some other option might waste less of it .  
2	  simply put , i , who have NO tech-knowledge whatsoever , had this hooked up in under five minutes . hook red to red , white to white , and yellow to yellow to your tv output , and that 's it . fit in less than two inches of height space , and satisfies my Hex obsession . I am shocked at the simplicity and thrilled with my lusting-over-Azazeal ability . if you love Hex , you know what i mean !  
2	  Hp 27/28 Inkjet Print combo pakThis is by far the best price for quality product for Hp printers . I will buy from here , because I can trust they are good products . I have purchased elsewhere only to get inferior quality products . I would not hesitate to buy this product many more times from Amazon . com  
1	  I ordered 2 of this item , All I can say : it should not be for sale ! it is a peice of junk and made of very cheep materials . On item was not working at all , the other came with a factory defect in the mic . I threw both of them in the recycle pin . Don't even think of ordering it .  
2	  You buy a camera and you like to keep it all tidy ? Get a bag . This one does the trick for me with my Panasonic FZ8 . It has two more side compartments . One i use for my spare battery and charger and the other one is filled up with some spare lenses . If you like to have a good bag for your buck then this one is a great option .  
2	  solid design , heavier than you think . increase my signal about 30 % , I think my cable company shall install better booster for me . anyway , happy with this product  
1	  Link never up . After call tech . support , Linksys told me that the Texas PCI-1420 card bus controller is not supported and will not be supported soon . It should list the limitation as part of spec . [ ]  
2	  This product is great . I just transfered over 3 Gbs of data from my home computer to my laptop . I coudn't have done it without the cruzer mini .  
2	  I bought these at wallmart .. was trying to find some phones that would sound very good but wouldnt allow other sounds in and would not break after a few months of use .. my fav before these were sony earbuds . they had damn good base and good overall sound but would get the cloth covers dammaged and then got ear wax clogged after a while and the wires would break .. so i got these .. i hated them at first due to the fact that bass sounded like A $ .. but after pressing them to my ears with my fingers .. WOW they sounded fantastic and could handle some impressive volume .. so i got me some head bands from the doller store to wear over the speaker sections of these to have them held to my ears while listening .. they sound great that way .. they are cheap and sound great once you press emCheers  
2	  I called several IT places looking for a way to transfer the files off my old hard drive ( mother board failed on PC ) to my new laptop . They quoted me an average of $ 135 for the work . I found this product and thought I would give it a try . I received it in a matter of a few days and within minutes of getting out of my mail box , hooked it up . It worked quickly and very painlessly ; a no brainer . I 'm not an " IT " type of a guy but the PC noticed the drive , I copied and pasted and presto .. done . I saved more than enough to pay for a few rounds of golf . I highly recommend this to anyone .  
1	  I got this a while ago ; Too many steps to get to your saved files . It also stopped working ( got the blue screen of death ) and i cannot get to my files . Would not buy this product again nor would i recommend this product .  
1	  I ordered two units - the first was bad right out of the box . The second began going bad within a few days . The LCD screen had light and dark spots and became so garbled it was completely unreadable . Also , it is not back lit as indicated , or at least not back lit enough to make a difference - and it doesn't light up when a call comes in . Avoid this product .  
2	  This device does the necessary job of completing my wireless network in my home .  
2	  very good product its working with my sony xplod amp and it work perfec just wat i spected thank a lot  
1	  I did tons of research when I was loking for a NAS and this seemed to be the winner given its giga-ethernet feature and claimed FTP remote access ( I couldn't get it to work ) . The unit looks to be well made , and it connected itself to my network once powered on . I can map a drive to it , no problem . However , the utility software and documentation have to be the worst I have ever seen . The utility software looks like made by someone with just a couple of days of programming training , and the document doesn't match the software consistently . The worst part is the web-based Configuration Utility couldn't even come up . Without that , nothing can be configured . Called the so called 24x7 customer support line . Apparently my understanding of 24x7 support was wrong , only the automated voice system is 24x7 . After a long hold , I gave up and sent two emails using the form on the Buffalo Tech website , didn't get an acknowledgement in my email account . I called again two days later , after about 40 minutes of hold , finally got hold of a woman , who sounded very rushed . She asked me to power it off , press the reset button , and a combination of these , put me back on hold a couple of times so she could check with someone else . After 20 min , she gave up and told me it 's likely a firmware problem , and said they could replace it . I agreed ( though not sure what a replacement could do if it 's a firmware problem ) . What finally ticked me off is that she said I had to pay for the shipping for BOTH the new unit they were to send me AND the shipping for me to send this one to them . Uhh . So I returned it to the seller . I 'm an IT professional and thought that I wouldn't need help even though I already read that Buffalo Tech 's custom support is ridiculously bad . Boy , was I wrong . The hardware looks well-built but when it comes to human related stuff , like software usability , documentation usability and readability , and custom support , Buffalo Tech has to be the worst I can remember .  
1	  I ordered this product from ANTOnline , and never received it . Their customer service department just blew me off . I suggest you order products from one of the many other vendors in the Amazon marketplace .  
1	  The following are the only supported operating systems : 2.1 Windows 952.2 Windows 982.3 Windows NT 4  
2	  Satisfied with the sound . Koss Porta pro are a bit more comfortable . I was happy with the porta pro until the cord frayed internally and stopped working on both channels . Wires were thin and it wasn't fesible to repair the porta pro . The Titanium has a longer cord and a tad heftier construction . All in all I 'm satisfied with KOSS products .  
1	  I have had two of these ( the first was replaced for free ) . In both cases the shoulder-strap materials frayed and separated . It is too bad because otherwise it is a nice backpack .  
2	  Works well with my ipod nano 4th gen .. just turn down the volume to about 1/2 or it will sound really bad over your car stereo . The sound is OK , but a bit flat .  
2	  This is one of my first digital cameras and I absolutely love it ! I bought this over the summer ans couldn't be happier with it , it takes excellent pictures and so far I haven't had a single problem with it . My mom bought a Vivitar camera and it dosen't even compare to the picture quality of my casio for abou the same price . Would definately recommend to anyone !  
1	  For the short period of time my m : robe actually worked I found the following : Pro : Cool looks . Contra : Unreactive user interface-reaction to pushing a button takes forever . Camera is not much better than a cell-phone camera . Player doesn't integrate with MS Media Player . Olympus provides some sort of poor-man 's Media Player / iTunes application forcing you into reencoding your music collection . Now to the worst part , Olympus service : I dropped my m : robe from ~ 2ft hight while it was in its little pouch . It still played the music I had on it but any new songs would hang the system and only turning it off would help . This is where my troubles with Olympus ' tech-support began . Endless waiting in hot-lines , circular phone menues . I finally sent my m : robe in . Weeks of waiting . In return to my e-mail enquiries I received long form letters without any relevant information about the repair status . They have a website for registered customers that is supposed to show the repair status . Mine never changed . After three months and an other attempt at getting someone on the phone I found out that I was supposed to pay $ 160 repair . I had the m : robe returned unrepaired ( since they sell used for less than $ 200 ) . My m : robe was an expensive experiment . Stay away from it .  
1	  I have bought this unit through Panasonic web site for $ 107 Dec . 1 , 2004 for my son as Christmas gift . He didn't use it until Jan 2005 . It 's DOA ( dead on arrival ) . I call Panasonic help line to get a replacement . ButI was told it has passed 30 days and I have to send to local dealer to repair . The local dealer charges Panosonic $ 120 to get part replaced . It works couple months . Now the disk tray won't open . Once it opens , it won't close . And the tray keeps spinning . I think I will get Sony DVD player from local store . At least it 's easy to replace the unit if anyting goes wrong .  
1	  Buyers beware of the protected equipment claim ( $ 75,000 repair or replacement ) - it is apparently worthless . Had $ 1100 damge to plasma tv and home theater receiver which the factory approved repair technician certified was caused by lightning surge through the properly connected Monster PowerCenter ; filed the claim and returned the device to Monster Cable which then took 6 weeks for them to deny claim . Do your research and you will find that there are much less expensive and higher joule rated supressors available , although I don't know if they would do any better at protecting your equipment . In addition avoid the claims by salesmen ( such as at Best Buy about signal reduction in lower priced HDMI cables-Consumer reports found there is no difference . Digital signals are either on or off there is nothing to degrade . Expensive lesson for me .  
2	  I 've been using the MX5000 ( the Japanese version of the DV953 ) over a year , and I can assure you that this cam is a huge bargain . You can get one for $ 1100 or less ( even cheaper than the 1CCD TRV80 ) , and you know what ? This cam incorporates the 3CCD technology that are widely used in professional video cameras today . Another great thing about this cam is the Leica lens that has special multiple coatings , and the Zeiss lenses in Sony cams are a joke in comparison . Buy this cam instead of the TRV70 , 80 , 950 ; by doing that , you 'll save more money . * The Good Things about the DV953 - " optical " image stabilizer-auto ( not manual ) ND filter-great color reproduction ( sometimes better than the TRV950 ) - much more flexible , intuitive manual controls compared to the TRV950-high resolution : 540 lines-manual iris & shutter control-much better audio than that from any Sony cam ( TRV70 , 80 , etc .. )  
2	  This is the second pair of headphones I 've purchased in the last 2-3 years . The first set was a pair of Sony MDR-605s . I bought them because they were around the ear type , meaning the set didn't rest on your ears , rather the area around your ear . This was to help with listening fatigue and tired / sweaty ears . They were also " open " so as to allow air into the area between your ear and the speaker . They worked really well and I enjoyed them , the problem is that the ear pad wore out and became uncomfortable . Of course they weren't replaceable . And sound reproduction , when compared to the EH-350s , is tinny and lifeless . After doing some research , it seems no one makes headphones like the MDR-605 for a decent ( sub $ 100 ) price . So I resorted to looking for something similar and thought I found it in these headphones . I was wrong . After extended periods of use , say 2 + hours , your ears sweat and it becomes uncomfortable . With smaller ears this may not be a problem . It seems like they were designed to be around the ear , but my ears are probably too big . The other issue is that they are closed , so there is no air flow between your ear and the speakers , so your ears sweat . The sound quality however is fantastic . Deep , accurate bass and accurate highs . Some say the highs are too high , but I believe this is actually what the producers have in mind when mixing their music . I hear things in the music that the MDR-605s never let me hear . I am thoroughly impressed with the sound quality , so much so that the ear sweat and listening fatigue are issues I will just work around . If you are looking for over powering bass , shop elsewhere . The music is represented at the levels it was supposed to be heard , not with any enhanced bass included . I use these on a portable MP3 player and am completely satisfied . The one issue however with MP3s is the amount of compression . I 'm finding that depending on the music type , even at 256 bit encoding , some compression problems , that I never heard on the MDR-605s , are apparent . This isn't the headphones fault but the fault of the compression . Guess I may need to look into a higher rate in the future . I 've also used them and will use them , when playing on the PC and also when listening to music . I 'm sure you can find better headphones than these at higher a price , but for $ 60 they are a bargain and probably better than most other offerings in this price range .  
1	  When these in-ear headphones are properly installed ( and getting them in right is like an installation ) the sound is amazing . I 've heard parts of songs that I 'd never heard before . But the headphones suffer from two massive flaws . The first is that if the headphones move the tiniest bit out of your ear canal , the sound quality plummets . This is a huge problem because the cord is so long that it is guaranteed to catch on something and jiggle the earbuds . Even when wrapped up and out of the way , the cord will respond to the slightest movement and pop the earbuds out of your ears . This is extraordinarily frustrating , all the more so because the sound is so good . I do NOT recommend these headphones to active people or to people that plan on moving much at all . If , however , you don't plan on moving much with these headphones , you 're golden . Also note : that little case that comes with them should be used all the time ; the earbud pieces will come off in your bag or pocket and the case helps prevent that . It also helps prevent just whipping out your iPod and listening , since you have to undo the case and store it , but that 's the least of your problems with these headphones .  
2	  You really must try this cordless iron . I have had a cordless iron before ( a different brand ) and loved it , but it did not have as big of a water tank as this iron . I just recently purchased this iron to replace my other cordless , but I will never go back to a corded iron again ! P.S. I thought I should tell you that I do a lot of quilting so I do use my iron often ..  
1	  I 'll be brief .. I 'm not unfamiliar with GPS ( I have 3 others ) . The website is terrible . I can't find map updates . Email to customer service for location goes unanswered . The manual gives good detail about using the features except the basic gps . Only 2 " favorites " are allowed . The manual explains how to change the name and / or address of the favorites , and the instructions are wrong . Once you figure it out , clicking the " change address " does nothing . Clicking the " rename " works fine . Nice looking unit though .. which is typical of Italian design , and poor service is typical also .  
2	  I ordered this for my playstation 3 , since it only comes with AV connections , and the difference in video quality between the AV cables and this HDMI cable is phenomenal . Keep in mind that if you do not own or use an HDTV , then this cable has nothing to offer , but few SDTV even have a port for HDMI so I suppose that goes without saying . Arrived in a decent amount of time and the price is unbeatable when compared with a what mainstream retailers charge ( $ 30-$100 , depending on length ) .  
1	  Great looking , seems easy to use . But the one I got just didn't work ! had to send it back . you get what you pay for !  
2	  This adapter performs as promised and has been in use since it was delivered , Good product  
2	  I liked this camcorder , it was very nice and it has great picture too  
2	  40 gigs is a lot . not only coes my iRiver carry all the music i have ever owned . it also carries movies , pictures , school documents etc etc . it really nice to be able to pick up the player at a friend 's place and start watching some movie .. it supports ogg . why use mp3 or wma when ogg is smaller , better sound quality , and open source ? why support microsoft when you have another option ? optical line in / out . finally i can plug it into my dvd-video and record my dvd-concerts right into cd quality wave files , totally lossless . voic recording . now i dont have to carry papers and a pen wherever i go . and i like the design . the white plastic hospital look of the ipod made me concentrate of not scratching it all the time . one is black , and the metal in the ends of it makes it look really robust and powerful . even though the firmware have been delayed a couple of times , this version of it really rocks . people are mostly angry about that the promised on-the-fly playlists and the gapless playback didnt come with the last version . but hey , i can live without those . unfortunately the battery doesnt keep up for the promised 16 hours , but its still better than the ipod 's 12 ( or whatever it is ) . this is a really good player . his player really has as least as many features as the ipod 's design rewards . why even consider the ipod an option ?  
2	  I really needed this backpack since I have back problem . Graduate course books are heavy so I was thinking to buy nice looking and convenient rolling backpack . I bought this one and I am happy with my choice by now . The zipper could be more easy to pull though . It has life time guarantee .  
2	  I bought this bag a couple weeks ago and I chose it for the space and it 's looks . As someone else pointed out , this looks like a regular backpack which is great . I found I want to be able to carry my laptop with me , so I ordered the Adventure 9 bag and will be returning this one . This is NOT a small bag , it is a regular sized backpack ( like the Jansports or Eastpaks you would put your text books in ) , but there are two main compartments , one above and one below . The one below has dividers attached with velcro that you can position to carry your equipment . If you want a bag that will allow you to quickly grab your camera , then don't buy this one because you will have to take it off your shoulders , put it down , unzip the bag , take out your camera , zip it back , throw it back on your shoulder , take the shot and so on ( in this case you want the LowePro Slingshot ) . If you just want a bag where you can store your camera to get to a location where you will have it out all day , then this is a great bag .  
1	  I 'm not even sure it made it to the two-week mark , but one side went out . If I connect my headphones just so - not completely in - then I get sound in left and right , but at a lower sound level . But it was a $ 3 purchase , so I guess I got what I paid for .  
1	  I searched for a while before deciding on this player , and at first I loved it . It played everything beautifully and was so easy to use . I even bought one for my sister when their old one died . Then out of nowhere , this player began skipping all over perfectly good DVDs with no scratches on them . I cleaned it , to make sure , but to no avail . I am never buying another sony DVD player again .  
1	  I wont recommended . Major design issue , memory gets messed up after one year and the factory still don't have a fix for it . its not worth it  
1	  Take my advice - don't ever buy a Logitech product . You essentially can't use the remote ( or change the batteries , for example ) unless you connect to the internet and download all your devices onto it . Sounds great , right ? Not really , because Logitech 's web site appears to be down more often than it 's up . And when it 's down , all their software just hangs . No message , nothing . Just hangs , while you sit there like a moron staring at it . ( At least , that 's what I did ! ) They also appear to have no support for Lion . What 's worse , Logitech as a company appears not to really give a rip . They responded to a question about Lion by saying that they were " working on it , and it was a priority . " Nothing along the lines of , " This will be ready on the following date , " let alone , " We 're sorry . " Don't expect to talk with a CSR in the United States ; they don't have any CSR 's in the United States . When you eventually ( and it appears to take about 20 minutes , on average - check the internet ) find out that the problem is 100 % on their side , they 'll tell you that it 's " software maintenance " . It 's not maintenance . It 's that they aren't able to keep the site up . However long you have this remote , you 'll spend more time setting it up and waiting for Logitech to sort out their network woes than you 'll ever save because you 've got one remote to deal with instead of more .  
2	  This was precisely what I wanted ! It holds a CD player , CDs in sleeves , and has a built in speaker . Quite good sound , and all well protected in a hard case . I took this with me for a year in Chad : a very hot , dry , and sandy country . The case protected the speaker , player , and discs perfectly , it sounded great , and it held up well in the elements .  
1	  I bought this mouse / trackball to try and relieve the pain in my fingers . Used it for almost two weeks without relief to my aching joints . I find it very awkward and unnatural and it 's very difficult to hone in on a particular pixel . I just received my new ' Zero Tension Mouse ' . It 's a joystick-like optical mouse that allows my hand to rest in what is supposed to be a more natural position ; imagine your hand in the ' hand-shaking ' position . It feels comfortable enough and is more natural to use than the trackball . Perhaps the Kensington works better for larger hands but if I hadn't cut the box ( dumb ) , I 'd have sent it back . And if there weren't eighteen of them ( used ) for sale on Amazon , I 'd try to sell mine there . For those of you considering it , give it a shot but DO NOT damage the box in case it doesn't work out for you . These devices are very personal choices . I was disappointed ; it might work great for you .  
2	  Good quality cable , ends are securely connected through rubber boots . Keeps the weather out . One downside , the cable is LMR-200 and not LMR-240 . A little bigger cable would have less loss but at 26ft its not too much of an issue .  
2	  I love it . I lost the original one I purchased from Best Buy at $ 59.00 . This was a great deal . Thanks Amazon .  
1	  This was the first hdmi cable i ever bought . I was told by friends that expensive cables didn't offer more quality . After this experience , I don't know if I believe it . I read all the reviews and thought how great is it to find an $ 15 hdmi cable . Well now I am out $ 15 and have to find a new cable . Problems : 1 . Seller is listed as hdmi king through amazon . com . Yet it comes to me through some Abascus123 seller ? When I try to return it I have to contact some third party . Never had this experience when Amazon 's name is on it . Packaging was just a mailina envelope with the cord . Seemed like it wasn't new . 2 . The picture was fuzzy , it was like a 1985 TV screen ! My component cables were very picture perfect . 3 . After 2 weeks , the fuzziness slowly got worse . Now when any part of the screen goes black , blue lines streak across the screen . So much for HDTV ! And yes , all the cords are plugged in tight and I haven't run over them with a lawnmower or anything . Just want to share before you think you are getting a good deal but may waste money . Maybe it is just my cord or the seller that sold it to me . I am surprised by amazon 's quality to ship my order off to some third party . This is the first time I have received an item " supposedly " sold by Amazon . com but did not show up in an Amazon labeled box .  
1	  BUYER BEWARE ! I purchased this mp3 player and at first it worked just fine for less than an hour . SYNOPSIS : This is a neat toy but has become a very expensive paperweight after just a month . The product tries very hard to be a jukebox / second hard drive , but it is not functional for someone who plans to update / change files and songs due to the VERY SLOW USB 1.1 connection . Save your money and get a player with faster connection options , better usability , support , design , etcBUGGY : The player freezes / hangs when it is powered down and then turned back on for use . Additionally , the display freezes and hangs after playing more than five songs . Total pain since I CONSTANTLY have to reset the unit . And I don't always have something to jam in the super small reset hole-regular pens won't do it . POOR PRODUCT SUPPORT : I have had no success in downloading updates to fix the problem because there aren't any . What happened to customer support and providing updates for users ? SLOOW INTERFACE : The USB 1.1 interface is very slow and takes a long time to initially set up your library on the computer . Took all night for me to upload the 5 Gig of songs / albums I own . Big downer since I was excited to have it charged and ready to go in an hour or so . DESIGN : It is bulky and awkward to wear if you are working out / jogging . BATTERY LIFE : Battery life is very disappointing only around 3 hoursSYNCRONIZING / ORGANIZING SONGS : The Music Match software is a very slow and awkward interface to sync files . The ability to create playlist is a good idea since playback of syncronized songs is HORRIBLE ( more on this later ) . Creating play lists is fairly easy and with Music Maker , but loading playlists on the player is VERY TIME-CONSUMING . PRODUCT INTERFACE / USE : Poor interface / use . Unless you use the playlist maker ( which is time-consuming to load ) , you will be very frustrated at the playback functionality . There is no inherent song continuity unless you are willing to listen to your entire collection-unsorted . That is to say there are several options for playback : artist , album , genre .. and each with its own quirks and painsArtist playback : If you try to play songs by the same artist you can only listen to songs from the same album . If there is a guest artist in a song then you will have to select that one separately . When the current album is over you will have to go out and select the artist 's other album . All possible to do but it shouldn't be so difficult . Album Playback : Songs only play from the same artist and same album .. if there is any differences-ie movie soundtracks with multiple artists-the songs will play from each artist / group individually and require you to navigate back to the album and select another song . Song genre playback ? It is a combination of artist and album difficulties-oh its even more painful ! IE : You can't listen to all the Rock songs at once because you 'll be selecting the songs by artist / group and album . DIFFULTY AS A 2nd HARD DRIVE : It is difficult to use as a second hard drive / transfer files between computers since you have to install the driver and restart on each computer . NOTE : My friend who owns an Mac was able to plug the USB into her computer and immediately recognized it as a hard drive . THIS IS PLUG-n-PLAY at its best ! This begs the question .. WHY do the Windows users ( the intended audience ) have to install a driver to use it ? GOOD FOR CD CHANGER REPLACEMENT : I also want to say it is very nice to use the unit as a CD changer in my car . Finally my tape player has a use again ! RECOMMENDATION : I do like the idea of a second hard drive but I would recommend an mp3 player with a USB 2.0 / Firewire interface if you have a lot of files / songs you plan on backing up / syncing . If you want a high capacity " jukebox " or 2nd hard drive DON'T BUY THIS ! There are A LOT BETTER ALTERNATIVES to spend your hard earned money on ! CURRENT STATUS : I am currently in the process of sending my player for service and if it has any more problems I plan on getting an iPod or something similar with Firewire since my computer doesn't have USB 2.0  
1	  I 've had this less than 6 mths , it already went out , and CS for the company is HORRIBLE ! First time i called i got a recording , it told me they were open 8-5 then I called the next day and I was hung up on when they found out i was not at home ( well sorry i work 8-5 and couldn't call from home ! ) I had my other router for YEARS never had issues , when i finally did , the CS department was very helpful . I only tried this one out after the other one was over 5 years old and needed newer software and this was a reasonable price . I wish i had paid more and not wasted my time or money on this POS !  
1	  Though I could almost live iwth the laptop-style design of this attractive keyboard , I could not live with the extra-friction surface the keys were given ( which I understand was not part of the keyboard as originally made ) . I ended up going back to the Apple-supplied keyboard , and the search continues .  
1	  Ok , in terms of the mouse itself , it feels nice and all buttons feel and look good . The BIG problem is that the Logitech software that you need to install to be able to program the buttons and scroll wheel causes the Mac to freeze up and crash . As soon as you uninstall the software then the Mac is fine . For reference , I am running a Macbook 2.0 Core Duo with 2 GB Ram and 80GB Harddrive , 13.3inch ( black one ) . So for Mac owners beware . I am returning this mouse back to Amazon . The mouse works but you can't use any of the programmable buttons which kills the whole point of buying a mouse like this .  
2	  Since I don't have cable I needed to combine two antennas to get all the channels . It worked . Now I can enjoy the same channels I had before they became digital .  
2	  Driving my bookshelf speakers , my 5066 sounded just great for the money ( for any money really ) , though it lacked tone and balance controls , looked awful and had cheezy interconnect terminals . I speak in the past tense about it because while re-arranging the multitudes of equipment on my workbench , I managed to plug the wrong AC adapter into the poor thing . Poof , my little 5066 became a thing of the past . I then bought the Super-T amp which performs like the orignal T-amp and also lacks tone and balance controls , but the Super-T has a nice looking metal case and better quality interconnects . I recommend the Super-T over the 5066 if only for aesthetic reasons , assuming you can afford the extra $ ' s . Otherwise , if you are on a tight budget , get the 5066 . Either way , you won't be sorry .  
1	  I ended up returning this product because after about 15 minutes , the insides of my ears were hurting . They were not comfortable at all .  
2	  SanDisk memory card is excellent . It runs fast & stable . The free bonus mini-reader & key-chain bag are so cute & convenient .  
2	  My 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 has a RBQ radio which has a 6 disc CD changer . My girlfriend has XM in her Solstice and loves it and wanted to get me XM radio for my birthday . I was concerned about changing out the radio because it has some good features , including the CD changer . We went to Circuit City and found out about XMDirect . They didn't have the adapter for Chrysler / Dodge and said they couldn't order it because of the Sirius and XM merge , obviously XM isn't shipping any additional equipment to the stores until the merge is completed , but they did say that they would install it for $ 50 if we found a kit . We started searching online and most of the kits were $ 250 . We went to Ebay and found the complete kit for $ 49 . We received the kit and it was new , still sealed in the box . Took it to Circuit City and within 2 hours it was installed . Contacted XM online and put in the Radio ID that was on the box and bingo .. XM . You can also find the Radio ID on channel 1 on my radio . The RBQ still works exactly like it did before XM except that when you press mode it now includes XM . I like the way the radio continuously scrolls the song title , artist and channel on AM and FM stations but it doesn't do this on XM . It scrolls the song title once then goes back to the main screen which is a partial song title . You can press the tune button to scroll throught the title , artist , etc . This could be a limitation of XM and not the XMDirect unit because the Solstice doesn't scroll either .  
1	  1 . If you have tons of cataloged pictures in the 3:2 aspect and don't want to start collecting 16:9's2 . And you are looking for a small P & S ; with full control AND WIDE LENSread this camera 's test in the November popular photography and you will realize that this camera is only 28mm in the 16:9 aspectIf you collect 3:2 's you will be buying something like 33mm in the wide end  
2	  I just got my 13 ' MacBook and this case is perfect ! I didn't want to buy a backpack or bag JUST for my laptop , but I needed something to protect my laptop . I 'm a student and I 'm constantly switching from backpack to bag to purse and so on . This case makes it easy to protect and travel with my laptop . Quality is great and its not bulky or akward .  
1	  I purchased a ' renewed ' television from Philips Outlet . The purchase came with a 90 day warranty . Shortly after one month , the television began spontaneously turning off . I took the unit to an authorized repair shop as Philips directed . After 45 days and many phone calls , the repair shop returned the television and said it was fixed ; however , when I brought the TV home , it was not fixed and I experienced the same problems . I contacted Philips and the repair shop immediately . Following another month of the repair shop waiting on Philips for direction ( wondering if they should attempt a second repair or replace the unit ) and many more phone calls , I was recently told by Philips that my warranty had expired and they would no longer fix the problem ( even though the problem that occurred when it was under warranty was never fixed ) . When the TV works , it 's nice . But I want to warn others about Philips customer service . I 'll never buy from Philips again ..  
1	  Nice enough product , but fans are already going out . The unit helped cooling my laptop and I was happy enough with the product , but it wasn't 6 months and the fans are growling and going out . They are extremely noisy on start up and do quiet down after a minute or so . I am just disappointed they didn't last longer with no more use than I gave them .  
2	  This product was easy to install and it picked up the signal with no problems .  
1	  Aug 13 , 06 : Used only when I traveled , with Beyond Contacts software . I synched it before and after travel with my office in my home computer to bring my Outlook contacts , tasks , and inbox with me . Two trips of one week each and it died completely on the second one . No rough usage . The Z22 cannot be used as a reminder as the alarm cannot be heard or felt - it needs an alarm like a cellphone . There is a screen keyboard , so Graffiti is NOT needed . The synch learning curve with the above software I found steep and painful . Note the 90 day warranty , which tells you something , and note the poor support / replacement documented in the other reviews . Probably foolish , but I am going to give it a second try . If this one fails also , I will wait for a Z22B with a useful alarm and proven reliability . 10 Feb 07 : The new Palm Z22 quit also . Carried it with me daily . It got TLC . Three months after starting its use , it quit , dead as a doornail , just like the first . For similar cases , enter " Quit " in the Search Customer Reviews for the Palm Z22 . Save your money and time .  
1	  I bought this from grafx4029 and it said 5 cartidges and I only got one blue color one . I emailed and he never responded . The ink was old and dry and didnt work . Do not buy from grafx4029 !  
2	  I say , " Buy a camera with a good lens .. it brings the light in . " This HP850 really takes good pictures . I get close up of flowers , great detail , and yesterday I captured a Blue Heron in flight . I am a point and shoot amateur , getting results that are turning heads .  
2	  This briefcase is a lot bigger than I expected . I 'm sure it 's my fault , as I have a hard time with interpreting measurements .. At any rate , it is very nicely made . Plenty of room for a laptop and a lot more . This bag could hold legal papers , or business papers , or even college books and notebooks . There are also pockets to stash your miscellaneous items . Although , if you stuff it full with your laptop and papers , it is going to be heavy !  
1	  I bought this TV about a year and a half ago , and although I was initially impressed with the picture quality of the TV , my TV has been in the shop for a total of 3 months as of this writing . The problem I 've had with the TV is quite similar to the one which others have described , where the TV randomly blinks off and on until it finally burns and fizzles out .. I have also seen that it is a serious fire hazard because of this same problem , although I was fortunate enough not to have my set catch on fire . I had purchased a 3-year extended warranty from The Brick , but their service center says that they have tried with no avail to obtain the needed parts from Thomson / RCA . I have tried contacting their customer support department , and they have been nothing but rude and unhelpful . I would not recommend this TV or any other RCA product , unless you enjoy headaches .  
1	  I bought these binoculars and they received very little use . The ring that you use to focus them broke . I sent them in for Warranty repair ( had to pay shipping ) included my warranty card and proof of purchase but was told that the only way that part could break is if they were dropped very hard . This never happened , they were treated gently and only lightly used , never dropped . There is not a scratch on them that would have happened if they were dropped . This is a moving plastic part that was obviously defective . Nikon is refusing to honor the warranty  
1	  Pros : These speakers look cool . The volume control unit is very convenient . Cons : You can only control the bass . On many songs you hear too much bass ( sounds like someone blowing in a jug at times ) OR the tweeters . Mid range is missing . If I had tried these in the store before buying I probably would have bought something else . Not a great sound at $ 50 . My Boston BA265 speakers , for example , had a much more even , rich sound at half the cost . I 'll probably sell mine and splurge on the Klipsch 2.1s . Maybe if your playing device has an equilizer you could smooth it out . Some people like this sound setting ; I just don't .  
2	  I like the sleek and elegant design of this player . With the ability to play MP3s , listen to radio with many presets , view limited video and pictures and text files along with being a digital voice recorder , this model has many features for the price . My only real complaint is not with the player itself but with the file management software that comes with it . I have two Apple iPods but use them predominantly for podcasts . The Samsung media software does not aggregate many different media elements into one central location like iTunes does . I found it very difficult to find and download podcasts for this player . The sound quality is as good as Apple if not better , and for music , it may be just great . Due to this limitation of the software , I did not get as much enjoyment as others might . For me , it is an expensive digital voice recorder and FM radio . I did give it four stars because it has great potential and looks and sounds nice .  
1	  Works fine for a few minutes , but fails right after . It just crashes and doesn't do anything . Don't buy this .  
1	  I purchased a Creative Zen Vision this weekend from a local retailer . I plugged it in and the light came on indicating that it was charging . I turned it on briefly while it was charging ( a few hours in ) and turned it back off . I was never able to get it to turn back on again . So I returned it and got another one . The second one was even more broken . When plugged in , the light didn't even come on . I left it there for a few hours hoping it might have been charging anyway , but was never able to make it come on . I returned it for a refund .  
2	  Nothing much to say about ram except that installed without a hitch and has been working great ever since . A good upgrade to any computer that needs it .  
1	  I wanted to give this no stars , but it made me choose at least 1 . I also purchased this item for my 50 mile commute from Northern VA to Washington DC and Maryland . I have had it for 30 days now with no luck , and have run into the same issue as others . I 've spent a total of 8 hours on the phone with Magellan with no luck , I have had at a minimum 10 e-mail conversations again with no luck . The GPS works just fine , the unit is receiving the radio signal , but no traffic updates . Magellan has been avoiding this issue for over 30 days now and I cannot return the product for refund . I also asked Magellan if they would refund my money with no response . Don't buy this product .  
1	  I purchased this charger about a month ago and already the unit that plugs into my powerbook is bent . I have to really play with it in order to get it to work . THe cord is definately thicker than the one made by apple , which was my reason for replacing my original power cord , the apple one had freyed . This is the second replacement cord I have purchased and the other one I bought lasted for almost a year - I had the same problem with that one as well - the unit that plugs into my powerbook became stretched and bent and would not stay in my powerbook . I never had that problem with my genuine apple charger . Not all chargers are the same that are purchased under this review . I also purchased a charger from another seller and it looks a little different , but I have yet to use it since I just recieved it today . I would say the if you purchase the one from brilliantstore I wouldn't get it . I have contacted them to ask for a replacement .  
2	  These tiny mounts are a must have for any Bose owner . They are beautifully crafted and are strong . Are capable of rotating 360 degrees . Are not ugly appearing as the cheap ones are . In a nutshell , if you have the money to buy Bose , do not shirk spending another $ 100 and buy these mounts . They are worth it .  
2	  Its great for what i need it for . I love the price . Id buy another one like this if i need one .  
2	  I initially bought the canon zr-70 but returned it after a few days because of its dismal and grainy indoor footage . Next went with the trv-19 , and i love it . It takes great footage outdoors and indoors , with no notice of any grain in the low light footage . I cant find anything to say bad about this camera !  
2	  I purchased these headphones for use with my iPod and under my helmet while I ride my motorcycle or mountain bike . I have found the quality to be as good as the $ 40 Apple headphones and they cost less . They have the soft rubber cup / seal that increases the bass quality while also reducing the outside noise . Since I use them while riding a motorcycle , this is a major advantage . The same I would think would be true on public transportation if you are trying to block out others without having to raise the volume . I also find the over the ear an advantage while putting my helmet on . You still need to push a little on the earpiece with your finger while putting the helmet on to keep to keep the side padding from trying to pull on the earpiece , but they are more secure . Like most high end Sony headphones , the lead all come to one side , but this can we advantage in clearing up the installation if that is the same side you store the iPod in your jacket . I also use these headphones with Griffin AirClick iPod wireless remote , which makes a great combination while riding a motorcycle or bicycle since all the controls are on the handlebars . The only reason I did not give the headphones 5 stars was because on occasion the rubber cup / seal can get stuck in your ear if you insert them too hard . You also might want to consider the black version so it is not as obvious that you are wearing headphones in both ears . I of course keep the volume way low so I am very alert of any emergency vehicles or other issues on the road way . It is just nice background music . Riding a motorcycle is like riding a two wheel target .  
2	  these magnetic frames are exactly what we need to display our 4x6 photographs on the refrigerator without the clutter of different magnets to hold them onto the fridge . i am going to buy more ! note that one seller sells a " six pack " so you can purchase twelve frames in one purchase .  
2	  When Cox Cable installed cable in my home they had the main cable feed a 4 way splitter that all went to different rooms in my house . That was fine . When I called them back to add another connection ( the cable was already run ) they were apparently too lazy or too cheap to put in a 5-way splitter outside so they just tapped into an existing connection and installed a 2 way splitter in the attic . While I always had an OK picture on the 2 sets that were affected by this installation they were always a little fuzzy ( especially on the lower channels ) and would sometimes ghost for a few minutes . I bought the Monster splitter because it was a lot easier to try and change out the splitter that Cox installed than to replace the splitter outside . OK , it wasn't easier , but it was cheaper . I 'm happy to say that it worked great . I compared the picture on those 2 sets to one that 's fed directly from the box outside and there isn't any difference in the picture . This thing works . [ .. ] .  
2	  I highly recommend the product from Creative . The sound quality is awesome with no sound interference . The product is also constructed well and is even eye catching to a certain degree . The issue I have come across is that it does interfere with my cordless phone ( Panasonic 2.4 GHz ) , which basically block the phone signal on the phone side ( no issue on the sound though ) . I have even since purchased another receiver for an outside setup ! I find this a good solution for whole house audio on the cheap with no hassle or down sound on sound quality .  
2	  Bought this model about 3 months ago to accompany me while walking . Sound quality is fantastic . Highly recommend . I don't use the TV channels but the AM / FM reception is great . Unit comes with nice sounding ear plugs but they are a pain as they keep having to be pushed back into ear when walking . Perhaps they are OK for sitting and listening . I purchased Labtech 450 headphones which I am also delighted with to use with this radio and my IPOD .  
1	  I purchased this product from Video Audio Outlet to use on a 2003 Pontiac Sunfire . A friend and I installed the stereo , but found that the unit powered on but had no sound in the speakers . At this point , the issue was more than we felt comfortable handling , so I called a professional installer . After looking at it , he determined the wiring harness was miswired / mispinned . The wires didn't line up with what they were supposed to line up with . The product was labeled properly on its packaging , he said . If the harness would have been constructed properly , everything would have worked the first time without a hitch and I would have saved $ 80 on the install costs . Be wary purchasing this product .  
2	  The Kodak Klic-8000 battery fits snuggly in the charger . It charges the battery quickly . The folding wall plug is a nice feature , no power wart to plug in the wall socket . Also handy is the 12 volt car adapter . I think it is nicer that the Kodak charger .  
2	  What can I say . It works just like the one that came with my Canon camera since it is the same one . This is always better than other brands that are rated for the camera .  
1	  Doesn't work . Tried using it with Real Player to play videos while I am on the treadmill . Would not work . Tried with iTunes .. same result .  
1	  Except the lens range , the picture quality is not at all good . Any picture taken indoors the shadow parts are all grainy and clearly visible . I am really disappointed with this investment . Save some more money and buy any other good lens .  
1	  Only paid 5.94 for two in my estimation not worth one cent . Neither one worked and with the postage i 'm paying to send them back I can only say BEWARE  
2	  This is an excellent product for someone looking to centralize backups and all types of files on a home network . I have used this disk for the past year and it is excellent , We have both Windows PCs and a Mac on the network ( wired and WiFi ) and it works great ! Just remember path names and that data transfer speeds are not that of a direct-attach drive .. I am ordering more to try multiple net drives . Great product .  
2	  I purchased the HDMI cable with the VIZIO HDTV , 42 inch . This is a verg good product and the best price anywhere .  
1	  I got this filter for free when I purchased a Canon lens to take with on a 2 week vacation to Italy , and I thought what the heck I 'll give it a try since it was free . I used it for the first week of the trip , and once my card filled up I transferred the pics from my camera to my laptop and I started looking through them . The pictures looked fine at first glance , but when you zoom in on the pictures you can see that everything is extremely " soft " looking and if there is a light in the picture there will be glare or reflections around the light . I thought it was something wrong with my new lens , which was odd because it was supposed to be a really good lens - and then it hit me : the UV Filter . I immediately took it off and went outside to take a few shots to compare with and without the filter . The picture taken without the filter are sharp and without glare , whereas the ones taken WITH the filter look like they were taken with a cheap $ 100 pocket camera rather than a $ 1,000 semi-pro DSLR camera . I 'm so furious that the pictures from the first half of my trip were wrecked , but at least a I found out about it half way through and was able to take decent pictures the rest of the trip . Just look at the reviews - 131 out of 950 ( 13.8 %) are 1-star negative reviews with the exact same complaints that I posted above , and that should tell you something isn't right ! I would guess that the majority of people who left a positive review for this either aren't very knowledgeable photographers , or they didn't really examine any of their pictures before leaving a review . I would return this filter if I could , but it was free so I guess I will just throw it out or maybe just leave it on the lens as protection when not being used and then remove it when I take pictures . As further proof that this filter should be entirely avoided , a few years ago a 3rd party company did a study of 16 different filters from 6 different manufacturers and this filter finished in DEAD LAST ! Do yourself a favor and pass on this filter , even if you have an entry level DSLR or are on a very tight budget , because it will make your pictures look like absolute garbage . Save up a few extra dollars and buy yourself a niceB + W Multi-Resistant Coating UV FilterorHoya PRO1 Digital Multi-Coated UV Filter ( which placed first in the above-mentioned lens study ) .  
2	  I bought this for using in my Canon G9 for shooting in RAW mode . Shooting RAW take a lot of space , but the ability to adjust shots in post processing is totally worth it . I wanted to be able to fit enough shots on this card to make shooting RAW practical . I can get 459 RAW shots on my G9 with this card ( according to the camera display ) , and I haven't run out of space while shooting ( yet ) . Besides , there is really no reason to skimp on storage these days since prices are reasonable . If you have a camera ( or other device ) that accepts and uses SDHC cards , I recommend it . I get good RAW mode shooting performance , speedy data transfers , and can shoot a whopping 1459 HQ JPEGs in Auto mode . If you use the video mode with your camera , you 'll appreciate the longer recording times too .  
1	  I have purchased two of these , and I feel like an idiot . I was told that the new version is supposed to work . BS . I did my homework , checked for compatibility and bought this and a stereo bluetooth device . Both were Bluetooth v1.2 , A2DP , and 0000 or 1234 passcode compatible . Neither have worked . I have even tacked down friends with compatible bluetooth devices with no success . I give this 1 stars ( because I can't choose 0 ) . Good luck with the companies tech support = voicemail . No reviews = bad product ( usually ) .  
1	  It was not an Intex pool as advertised . It was a Best Way Pool . This creates a problem because I could not purchase new filters from my local stores . I had to order them on line and they have yet to arrive , which has delayed our use of this item . I believe you should send what was ordered and what was advertised and not an off brand . I was very dissatisfied !  
2	  Cable allows video to be transferred from tape to computer . Works like a charm !  
2	  Nice product and great value for money .. The build in database for TVs , DVDs and so on is not that great but the learning function solves it .. The RF function is why I bought it for and it WORKS from the floor above .. I just got what I asked for ..  
2	  I 've put these headphones through their paces for a couple of weeks now . After winning a new set on eBay ( $ 25 , incl . shipping ) , I noticed several bad reviews on Amazon . com and epinions . com , so I didn't expect much . That said , I 've been very pleased with these headphones . I 've listened to everything from Bach to Metallica , and they 've performed without a hitch . I haven't tried 328 feet , but I 've gone at least 100 ' ( to take the trash out to the curb ) and they 've worked great . No , they don't deliver the bass punch of my old JVC corded phones , but the trade-off is that I can walk to the next room without knocking things off of shelves now . Yes , you do need to adjust the tuning from time to time , but certainly not as often as some reviewers claim . These are my first ' wireless ' headphones , and I 'm very pleased . I 'm a long-time JVC user , and I think they live up to the reputation .  
2	  For the money , this card is hard to beat . It uses a more elegant method of 3D rendering that saves memory bandwidth , the limiting factor of all modern graphics cards . [ .. ] The more overlapping mountains , buildings , bots , trees , etc , the better the relative performance of this card becomes . It is better than any of the MX cards I have seen . [ .. ] I was using a Prophet 4500 to play the game " Black & White " this afternoon and it was amazing .  
1	  Before you purchase this item you should know the following information available from the technical support section of the Linksys web site ( but not on the data sheet or user manual for the product ) : 1 . The WRE54G is ONLY compatible with products having WDS ( Wireless Distribution System ) support . Lynksys ( as of 01/20/06 ) only lists the following three products as compatible : WAP54G ( firmware version 2.07 or later ) WRT54G ( firmware version 2.02.2 or later ) WRT54GS ( firmware version 2.07.1 or later ) 2 . Wireless MAC filtering has no effect on clients connected through the WRE54G . There is no way to specify which MAC addresses can and cannot access the network when they are connecting through the WRE54G . 3 . If you do have MAC filtering enabled on your router or access point you must enter the MAC address of the WRE54G in the " permit " list for the expander to work . 4 . The range expander will reduce the transmit rate to approximately half of the original source data rate transmission . 5 . If your computer has a firewall such as Zone Alarm , you need to enter the expander 's IP address in the list of trusted IP addresses in the firewall in order to configure the WRE54G .  
2	  I am extremely impressed with this computer case . It is attractive in appearance . It 's very well made ( I have had NO handle problems ) . The removable laptop tote is a real plus . I recommend it highly .  
2	  Sound : Very good , and it can get very loud . ( I don't like it loud , but some people do ) Usage : Ridiculously easy . Just slide a bar to turn it on or off . Battery : Lasts for 12 hours . ( I 've only had to charge it twice so far , and I 've had it for about 2 months ) SHUFFLE ? : It 's not exactly an ipod that shuffles . It plays them in the order you downloaded them and it gives you the CHOICE of having it on shuffle mode . Computer Use : It is soo easy to update . Just plug it into your computer , and on itunes click on update . ( Of course , you need to add the songs first . ) Screen Issues : So many people hate how there 's no screen . It doesn't matter , because you only have 120 songs . If you want more , buy a nano , but .. I 'm warning you .. IT 'S EXPENSIVE ! It is about twice as much as the shuffle . Size : you 've probably heard this , but it is smaller than a pack of gum . ( Thicker than a nano , though . ) Overall , it 's great for people who don't need many songs . You guys would love it !  
2	  Had to throw my two cents in - I have owned this TV for over a year , and even now in stores I see NOTHING that bests it as far as picture quality , and most don't even come close , especially with black levels . I watch mostly movies , SD is good , HD is great , and Blu-Ray is absolutely amazing ! Can't comment on the detachable speakers as I never used them , but I 've heard their sound is better than average . If you do purchase this set , my advice is to go to a few online forums to find the optimum viewing settings for movies , etc - these settings are surprisingly easy to find and use . As to the reported " buzz " that some reviewers have noted , I have never heard it . It does put off a fair amount of heat from the top of the set , so as it says in the instructions you want to leave a good amount of space above the set . As far as durability , after a year it is still performing flawlessly , with no " burn-in " or any other problems . Pioneer has contacted me a couple of times with firmware updates which were also very easy and painless to install . Bought it online , saved a bundle , and the delivery was fast and efficient . In short , I did weeks of research before making this purchase , and haven't regretted it for a minute . Kudos , Kuro !  
1	  i bought this mouse .. since it looked cute and was pretty cheap .. wrong decision ! the worst thing about this is the left button .. its highly unresponsive and needs 3 or 4 clicks sometimes . And its really small and though some have said that it is ergonomic .. i find it very uncomfortable to use . my advice .. spend a little more and get a logitech or an MS one ..  
1	  I tried these speakers with an ipod nano ( 2 years old ) , and had multiple issues . The main issue is that when the ipod was docked I could not access the menu to find the songs I wanted to play . And after I removed the ipod from the speakers , the ipod doesn't work . Pressing menu , etc , does nothing . I have wiped the ipod clean and reset it to no avail . So be very careful with this product !  
1	  this is the worst set of speakers i have ever owned . the quality itself is not bad , but as the other reviews mentioned , they pick up EMI very easily . they are so senstive that i have to turn off my phone every night to avoid being awaken by these speakers . ( i don't like turning off the speakers , because the only way to eliminate the buzzing noise is to unplug the power , but every time u plug the power back in , the speakers make a LOUD popping noise . what 's ridiculous is that even the manual mentions the " known problem " , but altec lansing still decides to sell this p . o . s . ) i 've emailed and called tech support about the buzzing sounds caused by cell phones , but they offer useless advice like using ferrite beads ( which i tried and they did not work ) . save urself frustration , time , and money by not buying these guys . if u really want them , i 'll be glad to sell you my set ( if i haven't gotten rid of them already ) .  
2	  I bought this as a replacement battery for my Canon Digital Elph , the previous battery in which had lasted close to three years ! It works flawlessly and performs well ; I can easily go two or three events where I 'm taking 30 + pictures each time without needing to recharge the pack .  
2	  That is all that is important to me .. it does the job it is supposed to do .  
1	  DON'T buy this camera from Amazon . ( actually you can't anyways ) . We ordered this camera for our upcoming cruise . As time was tight we chose the more expensive purchasing option from Amazon . com as it was listed as " In Stock " and " available for PRIME Shipping " . I ordered it with Prime Shipping for 2 day delivery . Well 2 days came and went and no camera . I went back to my original order and noticed that the estimated delivery date was a week in the future ? How could this be if it was " In stock " and a ordered with 2 day shipping ? I cancelled and re-orded with over night shipping . The estimated delivery date was STILL a week away ! That is when I saw that the " ships and sold by Amazon . com " descprition I saw when I placed the order changed on the delivery notice to " Sold by MTA .. " . Talk about bait and switch .  
1	  This product is total crap . I get intermittent charges which require you to unplug and plug back in .. and even then it doesn't work . I thought perhaps the cable was bad , but I plugged it into my computer and it charged just fine with no problems . The power unit itself indicates with a red light that it is receiving power from my car , but when I plug in the USB cable to charge my iPod .. it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't . Really annoying . Get a Belkin cable . Never had problems with them . AVOID THIS !  
2	  I especially like how they didn't compress the arrow keys between the number pad and the rest of the keyboard . My only complaint is the power button .. it 's too easy to hit and I often ended up inadvertantly turning off my computer by hitting it . I simply took the key apart and it works fine .  
2	  Has exceeded my expectations . As good as image quality as my XSi and 17-55 f / 2.8 IS USM and much more fun to use . The camera just feels great when its in my hands and is an absolute joy to use while taking pictures .  
1	  There was no indication that this was an upgraded memory chip that I was ordering . It would not work in my camera . When I received it the supplier did agree to take it back , but under the terms of Amazon and the supplier , the shipping charges were non-refundable . Last time I place an order like this . I had to pay shipping charges both ways which made the refund only worth about $ 5 after I deducted the shipping charges which were $ 26 .  
1	  I 'm only placing my Zire31 review on this Z22 page to warn potential buyers of short 90 day warranties and poor hardware on these less expensive units . Hmm , I wonder why they only offer 90 day warranties then ? The more expensive ones carry 1 year warranties . I bet those hold up a year or more . I don't want people to think I mean the Z22 will have the Zire31 problems I had , just be wary of the product carrying a shorter warranty like mine . See below for my Zire31 review .. " I originally bought this Zire 31 after having good luck with my previous m105 . I just got tired of the AA batteries hard resetting the unit when changing them , and the m105 didn't sync with Outlook natively without buying extra software . Anyway , there is a reason why the new Zires have 90 day warranties and other more expensive Palms have 1 year warranties . After 4 months ( one month beyond warranty ) the mini-usb port on the side went bad . Every time I plug in a cable , it hard resets itself and loses all data . Even if you jiggle the cable slightly it does this . After 20 minutes on the phone with a tech support person in the far east , I still could not convince him of this . He kept saying I needed to try this or that , totally unrelated to the real problem . I guess it wasn't in his script ! He just didn't understand . When I finally talked to someone else , they informed me of the 90 day warranty , and that I would have to pay $ 75.00 minimum to repair . It only cost $ 130 ! After shipping , why bother ! Spend the extra money for one with a longer warranty , or better yet , don't buy a Palm . Don't buy this one even if you buy the extended warranty . Why hassle with it breaking at all . Very disappointed with the unit , and with Palm in general . Hope this helps anyone who may even be considering this unit . "  
2	  I like it alot . it works great for the zune , but sometimes it is difficult to push the buttons if you gots fat fingers , would buy again from the same peeps . shipping was fast and accurate , it got to my house .  
2	  I replaced the Infinity Gold speaker in my ' 97 Jeep with these . They more than met my expectations of what a $ 25 per pair speaker should be .  
1	  I purchased this Access Point to augment the range of my WRT54G router which , installed next to my PC on the third floor , would not reach a wireless laptop on my second floor or beyond . Following the CD 's instruction I promptly got stuck , lost my server connection , and spent 4 hours talking to a service representative of Linksys before I was told I had a " defective " unit because the power light on the Access Point showed " red " . A return and replacement shipment was arranged at the cost of $ 30 to me . The replacement proved that it too had a red power light which , I now know , is perfectly correct ! Again following the CD 's instructions I lost its remaining portion after wanting to change the channel . Another lengthy phone conversation finally taught me that there is no need to connect the Access Point with the router - as the instructions tell - and that the Access Point could be placed elsewhere in the house . A very complicated two hours of guidance , and very complicated settings guidance , eventually lead me to place the Access Point on the second floor and I can now connect my wireless laptop on all floors . What a nightmare ! And what lousy instructions ! I 'd not buy another Linksys product . Getting things done is just too much of a headache !  
1	  I just purchased this printer on clearance 2 days ago . I have printed 4 letters and approximately 6 or 7 " signs " on glossy photo paper for my son 's birthday party . I must report that I 'm already out of ink ! I have NEVER EVER had this problem with my old Lexmark printer . I purchased this HP because of it 's low clearance price ( I paid MUCH less for this brand new printer than it would of cost me to purchase 2 new ink cartridges for my older Lexmark ) . I 've emailed HP regarding the ink cartridges , because on their website , they claim that cartridge 95 is the largest this printer can accept . If this is the case , I will promptly return this printer as I won't be able to afford to buy ink every few days when this printer is used ! Otherwise , the print quality is great !  
1	  The package I received is totally different than the picture shown on this page and when I tried using the battery it was already dead . Guess that 's why they are selling it for so cheap with free shipping . You get what you pay for !  
1	  I used this camera once and have no good photos to show for it . It took 5 frames then skipped several and took 2 more , then nothing for the rest of the roll . We swam with sharks and I have nothing to show for it . Should have bought a disposable one .  
2	  I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter . It 's easy for her to operate on her own , and it looks so pretty on her dresser . We both love it .  
2	  They work great with well just about everything . I wanted some nice , low priced headphones . I got them for riding in the car and they fir my head well even though I have small ears . Love them . BUY THEM !  
1	  Looking for a good example of the word oxymoron ? Try Klipsch Customer Service . I have telephoned and emailed them 5 times and have never received a reponse . I would never recommend Klipsch speakers to anyone .  
1	  This thing works great if you ever get it set up right . The start activity ( arguably a very very important step ) is horrible if you want to modify it . I had to delete a device in an activity and then reinstall it to change start up activity . I needed to change the settings on the receiver and the tv for roku box . Good luck . It is great if your are very electronically technical BUT if you are not , get ready for some choice works . Help is extensive , not that helpful .  
2	  This Box is Awesome .. Excellent INvestment .. you won't regret buying this IPOD dock system .. the sound quality is just Phenomenal ! it sounds like a big sound system and it has a remote .. BEst ever .. nothing that comes out after this dock will compare .. or it will be extremely tough to beat !  
1	  When I received this unit it was improperly packaged in a cardboard box with no-zero-packaging material . The camcorder and the power module were bouncing around off of each other . Upon inspection and attempt to load a cassette cartridge I found that the switch to open the tape cassette holder was missing from the unit . Therefore the unit does not work . I contacted the shipper and was told by the company that I was a liar and that I was attempting to defraud them and they would not either replkace the unit nor refund my money . As a result of having been ripped off by this Amazon provider I will never again purchase any used items from Amazon .  
2	  fits great on my esi rebel works best at 50 setting or your going to get the bubble ring if zoomed to much worked great to get the paris france eiffel tower shot top to bottom while standing directly under great for the shots of the banquet hall for our daughters wedding definatly not high end but definatly cheap deal for good quality only 4 stars as it did not come in black it is silver ? would recomend to any one who just wants to play around definatly not acceptable for professional even if just starting up fun lens great price ! great seller fast shipping good packaging  
2	  I just bought my third pair of these headphones ! I can't find anything better for my needs - a good fitting earclip . They have only lasted about 5-6 months each , but the price has been reasonable ( $ 10-20 each over the past two years ) , so I don't mind replacing them . I put my headphones through a lot of abuse , and they hold up decently considering . The best part of these headphones : the earclip has a strong wire at the core , covered in a soft plastic / rubber , so I can mold them to fit my tiny ears perfectly ! I have never found headphones with a better earclip - others I have bought ( at stores ) either have no strong wire at the core or are not easy to shape to fit the ear . Plus , the part that goes into the ear doesn't go all the way inside and is padded , so my ears don't hurt after long music sessions . Earbud fans who want the earpiece to go all the way into the ear might not be happy with these headphones , but I find earbuds irritating in my ears , so these are a welcome change . The first versions I got were red and black , very simple , while the one I just received ( July 2009 ) is the same design , only it is now blue and white , with the added bonus of a slim / sleek volume control toggle on the cord . Note : If these are still listed as unavailable , and you want a pair , you might look at the Koss ClipperO headphones listed on Amazon - they look almost the same , though I can't vouch for them specifically . I 'm not an expert on sound , but I have never been unhappy with the sound quality , though I can't say I have high standards .  
1	  this is a good unit , im lazy , so i dont want to spend my time wiping cds , and making sure i dont scratch them . This little unit takes care of it all with the push of a button . Just hit start and it spins away and washes the little cd , then it starts spinning the other direction and drys it . it can be used either with an A / C adapter or with 4 AA batteries . Heres the problem , and why it lost 3 stars . These dont last long at all , i dont know if its a design flaw or what , but they seem to last about 6 months , and i dont use mine very much either . So far i have purchased 3 of them , and they all seem to break with in 6 months to a year . I tried contacting the company tht makes them , but they dont respond , so , if you have another option , id go with it , and try to shy away from this one .  
2	  I am extemely satisfied with my new Polk Speakers . These were to replace a pair of older and bigger Polk speakers . The new smaller speakers sound just as good if not better that the older bigger ones .  
2	  I got this cooling pad during college after Best Buy confirmed that my HP laptop 's hard drive had literally melted . This pad made my computer go from that to cool to the touch-with the PC 's high-powered fan speed never being triggered . It 's quiet-can't hear the low setting over my computer , and the high setting is quiet too . I like that it has 2 fans , and that it blows away on two sides-so if one side is blocked , it 's not a big deal . It is pretty bulky-an inch thick-to bring to school in my backpack along with books and laptop . I 'm currently , after having this 7 years , looking for a portable one , but this one 's left me with high expectations ! Update : The cord began to split away from the USB connection , rendering the pad powerless . I was reluctant to purchase this pad again , since it costs more than other pads that are now on the market . However , one big plus for my laptop that only has 2 USB ports is Antec 's is the USB cord provided another USB port . I shelled out the money a new one , same kind , and the cord didn't have this feature ! A few months later , my current cord began to stop working where it connects to the pad . I have to maneuver it into just the right position for it to work . Needless to say , I won't be buying this bulky , faulty cord product again !  
1	  I AM STILL WAITING TO RECEIVE THE TWO GPS UNITS I ORDERED ON 9-25-08I SURE HOPE TO HAVE THEM BY XMAS !  
1	  This item is cheaply made and the arms that snap into your player are difficult to retract . I got it stuck on my Sleek Photo and was afraid I was going to ruin the player trying to get it off . I 'll stick with the expensive but trustworthy OEM one . On the other hand , I 've bought Creative charge cables from this brand and had no problems with them . Also , the previous review is incorrect .. this is a transfer AND charge cable .  
1	  Amazon grouped all 3 of Audiovox 's digital picture frames together despite MASSIVE differences . Please DON'T count on the resolution till you read chart below taken from data on Manufacturer 's site . DPF1000 ( 10.4 " ) # 4:3 Aspect Ratio # 640 x 480 PixelsDPF800 ( 8 " ) # 4:3 Aspect Ratio # 800 x 600 PixelsDPF700 ( 7 " ) # 16:9 Aspect Ratio # 480 x 234 Pixels  
2	  they do work ( reduce noise ) but they are not meant to provide silence ie they work well when you hook them up to something . But ( i know that some people mentioned a hiss , that is an understatement ) when trying to cancel sound without music playing they create a fairly audible hum , i dont know if this is typical but mine did . summary : buy if you want some cool low priced , folding , good at reducing noise with music headphones . THey do not create silence !  
2	  Wow , what an idea ! The shrinkwrapping of plastic on your expensive iPod .. with a hair dryer set on high .. ! After the initial shock of heating up your iPod ( it really does get hot ) , I have to say that it didnt do any damage to it , but it offers some great protection . I have been using this for about three months now , and it has proven to be very tough , with no scratches at all . I 'm amazed by this , as I put it in my pocket , packed messenger bag , and knock it around hard , and not one scratch . It is a good product at a great price , and it comes with 7 of them as well ! I agree some practice is required to get a great wrinkle free fit , but I found that if you dont heat the front of the iPod , it works much better ( just heat the back and sides ) . All in all a nice product once you get over the fact that a hairdryer wont damage your iPod , but scratches will , and quick ! Highly recommended !  
1	  This thing didn't even supprot 1080i .. how are they going to call it a PS3 cable . Absloute waste of money .  
1	  I purchased a bottle of iDrops for use on my iPhone4 because the site said it worked with this model . I used it exactly according to the instructions provided , and it did remove smaller scratches . However , the iPhone4 's glass is also treated so it resists fingerprints ( oleophobic coating ) - iDrops also removed this treatment . The end result is that while the scratches are taken care of , the backplate looks much worse than when I started-fingerprints stick to it extremely easily , and you can easily see the outlines of the area treated with iDrops with even a casual brush of one 's fingers on the area . Due to the contrast with the area still affected by the anti-fingerprint treatment , it constantly looks more scuffed and scratched than it is . Now , I realize they only make claims about the product 's ability to remove scratches and nothing else . They even qualify it by saying it doesn't work miracles . Fair enough . I wouldn't recommend it for use with an iPhone4 though . It just looks awful .  
1	  The battery does not fit the 1D Mark II . You had to force it in . Died after 2 weeks . Do not buy it and save for the Canon ones ! It will save you money in the long run .  
1	  Like many computer accessories this one has an appealing list of features . Too bad it doesn't always work . The first one I received operated for a couple of weeks and then died . None of the LEDs would light and no USB traffic would pass . The replacement worked for a couple of months during which period I experienced odd delays and failures when restarting my computer or waking it from sleep . It even made Vista blue-screen with a USB device error . I 've replaced the Targus hub with a 7-port hub from Tripp-Lite and all the problems instantly disappeared even though all of the same USB peripherals are still in use . This indicates that the problem was definately the hub . Your experience may be different . Just be advised that this hub won't always work as advertised . By the way , my computer is a $ 5000 Dell M1730 laptop running Windows Vista Ultimate / 32bit . Another interesting observation : Since this ( and the replacement Tripp-Lite hub ) are both powered hubs , I assumed that I could plug my Sony MP3 player into the hub and have it charge without having the computer powered-up . But with either hub , the MP3 player refuses to charge unless the computer is powered-up too . This makes it pretty useless as a USB charger since I could just as well plug the MP3 player into the computer as having a computer powered-up seems to be a requirement in either case .  
1	  My little one really wanted one , so I succumbed , and as soon as it came , I knew it wouldn't last long . The USB connector actually is ON THE TOY ! After less than 20 times of using , it has stopped working , the light has stayed on , and no computer will recognize it . I think for a child under 9 or 10 , an inexpensive " generic " mp3 plyer from WALMART or online at Amazon would be preferable . One good thing is that hte volume is VERY low , which I think is a good thing for children to get used to .  
2	  I was looking for a case that would hold all of my sons DVDs and CDs and this one fit the description . The only reason why it got 4 stars is because in the picture it shows a handle . The one I got doesn't have one . It doesn't really affect its ability to protect whats inside , but it would have been a great plus for easy handling and carrying . Otherwise , its a great item to store my sons DVDs / CDs .  
1	  This monitor worked like a champ for a couple of years , then out of the blue , horrid blotches in the screen , aqua and pink . Made the thing useless . I paid a grand for this thing , a grand . I feel like I 'm gonna scream ! Never , Never , Never again will I buy another Samsung Monitor . I knew I should have paid more and got the Apple Display . I 've owned many Apple products over the years , and have never , never , ever had a single issue . I 'm typing this on a 2007 MacPro right now that has worked like a champ , and I can still get a grand for it today !  
2	  Okay , first the disclaimers : I have had my Tungsten E for exactly 2 days , so I can't whine about post-warranty problems yet . I have not added an SD card yet , so i don't know how fast or slow it is . I have not had time to discover the detrimental effects of the nice little flip cover . And I am not a tech-head , so my knowledge and needs are rudimentary . And , finally , I have a Mac . That said .. I have just upgraded from the original Handspring Visor ( deluxe , I think ) . It was a fine machine , but I just got tired of the monochrome screen and needing to find a couple of AA batteries every few months . So it was time to move along . I didn't need anything fancy , and since I have a very small digital camera , I didn't need the added bits in the Zire 71 . So the Tungsten E was just right for me , and I couldn't argue with the price . It came in virtually no time from Amazon ( which had the great price-thanks ! ) . I loaded the updated software and hot synced and was pleased to find that all my addresses and my calendar , which I kept on the Palm software on my computer ( s ) , made it in their entirety to the new PDA . Plus , after actually reading the manual for a few minutes , I was able to download some of the extra stuff I needed or wanted ( calculator , Documents to Go , etc ) . And then I figured out how to transfer photos ( jpegs ) from my computer to my PDA . Very simple , very quick , very cool ! I love the bright , colorful screen . It makes it such a pleasure to work on it . And , for my fellow Mac-ites , fear not . I have the latest OS ( 10.3.3 ) and everything works just fine ! I had absolutely no problem interfacing , downloading , etc . Finally , several folks have bemoaned the absence of the hot-sync cradle . I too used one with my Visor , but I must say that , not only do I not miss the cradle ( I can hot sync in my hand - and if you have a Mac , you know how easy it is to get to a USB port ) , but I like the fact that it uses an ordinary USB A to mini USB B cable . You can get spares at any electronics store ( for about $ 25 ) or for only $ 10 online at buynshop . com ; or a few reasonably priced accesories can be had from tangshop . com ( go to Palm Tungsten E accessories ) . So , thus far , I am delighted with the Palm Tungsten E , how it works with my Mac , the stylus , the look of it , the cable , the price-and that 's about all that there is , I think . I will probably eventually look into a spiffy case , and an expansion card , and whatever other bell or whistle seems to be in order . Bottom line : can i recommend it for Mac OS 10.3 users who want a user-friendly , sort of basic handheld ? You betcha !  
1	  Linux user ? Mac user ? Netscape , Opera , Mozilla , Firefox user ? Go away . Linksys does not want you . This unit is advertised as an ' Internet Video Camera ' . It should be called a Microsoft Video Camera . You can only view the streaming video in Microsoft 's Internet Explorer web browser ( it uses an OCX plugin ) . No other browser will work . If you use windows and one of the many other newer , more up to date and still actively developed web browsers , the only way you can view the video from the camera is to install the Linksys viewer / recorder software on the PC . Pretty much defeats the purpose of being able to view the video from any computer on the Internet at any time ( like say from work or an Internet Cafe or even a friends house . )  
2	  I have this great product and the graphics are great ! It prints at a good speed and is as easy as 123 to use . I love the nifty litle case for the cartages too . Please buy this and thank me later .  
1	  I bought this filter for my newly bought 70-200mm recently . I 'm currently on a trip in San Francisco where I dropped my bag . Thankfully I swapped this cheap baby to my 24-70mm with my B + W Filter ( which is 70 bucks apx ) . This filter failed to protect my lens . The front element cracked , and now the filter is stuck to my 1500 dollar lens . Great ..  
2	  The Targus Ultra Mini Optical Mouse ( TUMOM ) is an amazing piece of hardware . Its convenient size and weight make it just another competitor in the laptop mouse field , but what sets it apart from the crowd is its cord . Not only is the cord extremely thin and light-weight , but you can make the length anywhere from six inches to about two feet and then retract it down to nothing for transport . It 's almost like having a wireless mouse , but without the added initial cost or the ongoing cost of batteries . Having the second mouse button is a big bonus for Macintosh laptop users ; the third button ( depressing the scroll wheel ) is great too ( mine is programmed for Expos & eacute ; ' s " view all windows " feature ) . There are a couple caveats , but these are probably going to hold true for any laptop optical mouse , not just the TUMOM . When I plugged the mouse into my PowerBook ( in battery power mode ) it sucked about 20 minutes off the clock , which then kept dropping at an accelerated rate . Although it seems to have ergonomic styling , over use of the mini mouse will probably result in Carpal Tunnel Syndrome , so be careful out there . I 've only had my TUMOM for a couple days , so I can't speak to its longevity ( so far , so good ) . I 've had a hard time convincing my three-year-old that it 's not a toy ( I 've had a hard time convincing * myself * it 's not a toy - it 's just so fun to extend the cord .. retract the cord .. extend the cord .. etc . ) . The silver finish perfectly complements my Aluminum PowerBook ( I briefly considered a Microsoft laptop mouse that was also silver , but , hello .. evil ) . I was initially concerned that the retractable widget would get in the way while moving the mouse , but that hasn't been a problem . My previous favorite computer gadget was the Lexar 128MB USB JumpDrive , but this makes that look soo last year ( which it was ) . This is truly a gadget lover 's dream .  
2	  same product at park ave . electronics which is brand new costs $ 675.78  
1	  Yes , I know , I chose the cheapest shipping option . But that does not mean that the product should arrive three weeks after the estimated time frame that you gave me . I don't know what kind of deal they cut with you , but do your customers a favor and use UPS or USPS . Even USPS , in my experience , can get the product there in a reasonable time frame .  
1	  This made in China mp3 player looks very cheap from day one . Bought it in March , 2005 and used it for 2 month and it 's broke . The customer service put me on hold for a long time as well . Save yourself the trouble and get something else .  
1	  I purchased this cable based on positive reviews from others who had bought it here . Unfortunately , my experience with the cable was unsatisfactory . I bought the cable to connect an Xbox to a Samsung LCD TV which has two component inputs . I tried the cable on both inputs , and in all three modes ( 480p , 720p , 1080i ) . In all cases , I saw severe ghosting . I ended up purchasing a different cable from an auction seller , and it worked flawlessly - therefore I feel confident in saying that the cable I received was defective . Very disappointing , I was looking forward to being able to use the digital audio output connection too .  
1	  I get lots of smear and ghosting with this cable . Returning it . This is the second cable I 've bought off Amazon and both of them sucked ( different brands ) . Guess I 'll stick with the local brick-and-mortar stores . They 're less likely to sell garbage if they have to look you in the eye .  
2	  Upon receipt of these batteries , I put them in the phone and they had life in them , but the instructions indicated to give them a charge . I charged the for 24 hours before using the phones . I had used the phones a lot for almost a week without them ever going back into the charger . At the end of the week , they needed to be charged . These were well worth the minute cost .  
1	  This tral charger does not fit the Ipod I have and it was advertised that it did . Very disappointing because I now own two and and I can not use them .  
1	  I 'm giving one star for this product because it was doing very well until it 's LCD screan broke with only two years , and with not that much of a usage . I got very disappointed with this product because when I bought a Camera it was to use it for about five years . The LCD screan stopped working in a sudden while I was downloading videos to my computer . I tried to call the customer support and they told me the only thing they can do is to fix it with the cost of 175 dollars plus shipping . I guess I might as well buy another one from a different brand , because I won't be risking another disappontment .  
1	  The LCD screen is hard to see . It is awkward to use . It is difficult to program and then macros do not do what they are supposed to . I returned it and bought a Sony .  
2	  I don't have a lot to say about this D-Link switch . I plugged it into a port on my gigabit router ( also D-Link ) , and it has worked flawlessly to give my seven more ports . ( One port is used to connect the switch to the router . ) I made sure that I upgraded all my cables to CAT6 for full gigabit speeds . While I cannot verify the speeds , my NAS definitely detects a gigabit connection , and the speed of transfer is noticeably faster than my older 10/100 MB router and network . The switch also has indicators on the front panel to show activity , and indicators that show what speed is detected ( gigabit , 100 MB , or 10 MB ) . For technical users , I understand this switch is unmanaged , so it does not have traffic priorities . However , it is non-blocking so all ports can be used simultaneously at full speed . Highly recommended .  
2	  This is a great product to have . It & # 8217 ; s necessary to make un-combatable conations , & # 8230 ; compatible ! Not all connectors are RCA . The RCA-BNC famale / male adapter is a life saver when you need to make connections between different components .  
2	  its a nice rechargeable battery .. u can reply on it while u r in vacation ..  
2	  Good Network Cable . It looks reliable and made of good quality plastic . I wish I got a longer one though .  
1	  I purchased the router one and a half months ago . After upgrading the firmware , the router is very unreliable . The port forwarding sometimes works and sometimes doesn't . My KylinTV connection is buffering all the times . And now it has difficulty to obtain an IP from my ISP , while my computer can obtain one easily when connected directly to the cable modem . I hope I could return it now .  
2	  This was my first wireless network card i bought and i am very happy with it . I dont know what all the other customers are complaining about ive had no problems what so ever . It was so easy to set up ! As soon as installed the card and driver i was connected straight away ! This also has great range , having my router ( WGR614 ) set up down stair in bottom conner of my house and the WG311 all the way upstair in the utmost conrner room i still am able to get a strong signal . 48Mps on average . i highly reccommend this product to ppl who are just getting into wireless networking or even already avid users because this was so easy to setup and trouble free .  
1	  I bought the fan thinking that with the 3 different wires that come off it , I could chose to not use the controller that comes with it and instead use the fan controller I already own . Boy was I wrong . You must use THEIR controller if you want to control the RPMs at all - otherwise it faults to full speed ( 2400 RPM ) or minimal speed . I tried to take the wiring apart and re-wire to allow for the connection , but ultimately trashed it . Disppointing ..  
2	  After reading all of the reviews for this product , I had high expectations that did not go unmet . The sound quality is great , the bass is definitely full , but not to the point of drowning out or overpowering the mids and highs . They were only $ 20 when I purchased them and they 're far and above the $ 80 Sony earbuds that they replaced . My first sennheiser product , but definitely not my last . I highly recommend these headphones as an excellent choice with high sound quality and a great price .  
1	  This item is okay if you only want to take your laptop ( mine is a 17 " Apple powerbook ) and not your cord ! Its more like 2.4 inches thick not 3 . Amazon charged me to ship this item back because they claim it 's not thier fault that it is NOT 3 " . I normally love Amazon , but I lost money on this deal . A fella must have wrote this description as it is not 3 " on any ruler in my house . I did get the 4 " model of this case from Vanguard and love it . I would have ordered it in the first place if I had known .  
2	  This is the only player I found that will upconvert DVDs to 1080i over component for a decent price . Mine has a built date of February 2005 and upconverted all my store bought DVDs to 1080i over component straight out of the box .. no firmware necessary . Definitely a buy if Amazon gets anymore in stock .  
1	  I seriously cannot fathom how anyone can be happy with this product . I have a very high quality tuner / reciever that could not even pick up a clear signal from the TuneCast II from anything over a foot away , regardless of the frequency chosen .  
2	  Good guality label . Easy replacement for Brother label maker . Lasts a long time . Very bright white with good color contrast with black print .  
1	  the metal ring is thicker than pictured . install it before the lens change the looking of the camera . optical quality is so so .

2	  I have had my first SC101 for about 2 weeks now and have found it to be a great help in storing and accessing files from many different computers on our home network . I like the feature of being allowed to control the size of the NAS ( Network Attached Storage ) device by using common and relatively cheep IDE drives . I also like the ability to either have both drives available to store files or protect these files with a mirror . Finally I like the speed you get with this NAS . I had purchased the Linksys NSLU2 a few years ago , but with the limitation of USB 1 . X speeds and the Linux based OS on the file server , it was quite limiting . With the SC101 I am able to setup briefcases and access any file from any system on our home network . There are a few comments I have for the SC101.1 . The proprietary software to connect to the NAS device . It is DHCP and very limited on the configuration of the NAS for advanced users . 2 . The software that connects the computer to the NAS device rather than the usual practice of mapping a drive . I have found this method to be good for novice users , but somewhat unreliable over wireless networks . When the drive drops off , it usually requires a reboot of the computer to get connected . 3 . Wireless access is nice for normal use , but not very good when copying large files or large number of files . This is best done on a wired connection . I had many instances where the proprietary drive would drop off and would require a reboot to reconnect . 4 . File access times either over wireless or wired network is acceptable . When first accessing the NAS , there is a few second delay , but after that the files are acceptably accessible . I have been able to view video over a wireless connection with no issue to speak of . Improvements1 . I think Netgear should make improvements to the driver as well as how advanced users could have more control in configuring this device .  
2	  I like all Tiffen filter products and this one ( I have sevral others ) continues to meet all expectations . I recommend it highly .  
2	  Fantastic product ! So good I have 3 of them hooked on my network with NFS to share 2TB worth of movies and video podcasts . Very flexible and expandable but it does help if you know your way around the terminal and can do simple BASH scripting . Also using many linux " rippers " like mencoder / acidrip with lavc will tag the movie as FMP4 and wont play on these .. All you need to do is copy and change the fourcc to XVID , DIVX , or DV50 like so .. mencoder - oac copy - ovc copy - ffourcc DV50 wrongfmp4 . avi -o rightdivx5 . aviIt wont take long .. Make sure to add this in your mencoder options so you don't need to do this every time ( This is just a fix if you already have a ripped collection to play and didn't know .. )  
1	  Found this remote to be utterly useless . The software seems to require a fast internet connection to program it . I have one . Unfortunately the logitech server keeps failing . Expensive time wasting rubbish .  
1	  I ordered with high hopes given the positive reviews at Amazon but when I set it up I found the door would not open . So I am sending it back dissapointed .  
1	  Same exact experience as Ruppman and 71 Torino with XS 1500 - shows " overload " with only 1/5 capacity being used . Will not reset , battery replacement will not help , unit is a costly paperweight . Warranty probably expired ( two years old ) . I could have made a much better purchase for $ 300.00 .. Not recommended .  
1	  This printer makes me passive aggressive . I 've owned it for 3 years and never liked it . Two major problems . First , when printing the first sheet after turning it on , mine sits for a whole 83 seconds and does nothing but spin , make noise , rotate , slide back and forth , etc . It 's ANNOYING . Second , the black ink is problematic .. it EVAPORATES really fast . If I don't print for a couple weeks , half the ink disappears . I 've never seen that before in other printers . It makes the ink very expensive when I only can use half a bottle .  
2	  It is great , the third one in our home ! So good for the place you have you office equipment , stereo , etc . I totally recommend it to anyone .  
2	  This item was purchased to replace another that had served me well . Does not have all the latest " bells and whistles , " but is simple to use and does everything I need .  
2	  I 've had the mouse a while now and haven't had any of the problems mentioned prior . I use my computers mainly for gaming so I was hesitant at first of getting Wireless , but I wish I had bought earlier ! The mouse works flawlessly with Windows XP and all my games , including FPS games where mouse is critical such as Unreal 2 , Splinter Cell etc . The ONLY thing I 'll miss with this mouse are buttons 3 and 4 I had on my old IntelliMouse Optical . I 'll probably be upgrading soon to the Optical Desktop Pro keyboard / mouse combo and giving the Blue to a friend or using it on another PC .  
2	  Best Buy wanted over $ 20 for a basic printer cable while Amazon offers this Belkin for a quarter of the price . This is a high quality , well made cable that works flawlessly . I 've always found Belkin to be a good but inexpensive brand . If you need a parallel cable , I 'd strongly recommending buying this .  
1	  Beware ! BoBoTECHNIC , the seller of this item , charges about $ 5.00 for EACH item ordered , depending on your location and how fast you want it . If you order 4 of these memory cards , your shipping will be around $ 20 ! The purchase price may be low , but you 'll be gouged on shipping if you buy from this seller .  
2	  the Case Logic 6 USB wallet is all I wanted and I 'm glad I bought 2 from my reliable Amazon . com online store .  
1	  I got this kit hoping that it would fit my 98 Honda Civic LX . I even spent the night before the install carefully twisting , soldering , and heat-shrinking the wires with to the after-market Sony stereo wire setup . Popped the old radio out and suprise , suprise - the plugs didn't match . This very well may work on other ' 98 Hondas , but if you 're expecting it to fit in your Civic LX - look somewhere else .  
2	  first i have an older Garmin i5 GPS . it was smaller in screen size , but bulky and you had to rotate a dial to spell addresses out , etc . that was really crummy . but the nice thing about it is that it could acquire the satellites very quickly - perhaps within about 30 seconds . the Nuvi 270 is slow to acquire satellites . i regularly drive about 2 minutes before it finally figures out where i am to give me directions . if i know i am going to be using it i guess i should turn it on before i start the car if i really don't know which way to go from my starting point . that being said , everything else is really , really well done . you can type right on the screen and you can do it while driving . i purchased the weighted stand for keeping it on the dash and the combo can't be beat . we 're off to Europe for a few months soon so i 'll likely have more to add to this review once i 've tried this GPS from Italy to Amsterdam .  
2	  Expecting the device to work " of the box " I plugged it in expecting some result . Apparently the installation is relatively tricky and somewhat lengthy , requiring existing internet , before making the router working . I installed in in " wired " mode with my desktop first . That required 2 hours customer support , which I found very helpful and prompt . We almost gave up , then switched cables PC-to-router with router-modem . One of which ( blue ) came in box and another I found in old computer pile . To make it short - after install with desktop it works for about three weeks now without any problem with my wireless laptop .  
1	  This printer deserves a " big black hole " rating rather than any stars at all . All the prints that I do on matte photo paper come out dull . When I called the totally useless tech support they said that this machine only works well on Canon paper . They admit that it doesn't do glossy prints well on any paper . Too bad about the reams of HP , Epson , and Staples paper that are on my shelf . I caved in a bought Canon matte paper and the prints are more dull than when I used the Staples matte paper . Worst yet it guzzles ink like a Hummer ! I went through two $ 15 cartridges with about 20 dull prints .  
2	  The one that came with my tripod head ended up permanently attached to my long lens , since said lens is really too heavy to use without a tripod or monopod . I bought a couple of extra plates to use with other cameras / lenses . I agree with the person who said this plate can be hard to line up correctly . I 'm a mechanical engineer , and usually pretty good with spatial relationships , but sometimes it takes me awhile to get the thing on . If you look really closely , there 's an arrow on the plate to help you , but I suspect a lot of people don't notice it . It 's difficult to see in low light - which is , of course , exactly when you want to use a tripod . I finally took some nail polish and painted a little dot on the edge of the plate and on the edge of tripod head while they were connected correctly . Now it 's much easier to orient the plate and fit it in right . I just line up the dots .  
1	  This is a nice plug adapter but it 's NOT a voltage converter . My laptop , camera and gadget chargers worked excellent with 220 volts . I wasn't so lucky with my wife 's curling iron and hair dryer . Telling her she looks great is no substitute , so be sure to double check her gadgets too . Some European lamp outlets are recessed into the wall , so the plug will be seated flush instead of sticking out . They are elegant and beautiful , but too small for this plug adapter . Finally , bring a power stip unless you want to move the hotel furniture each time you change a plug .  
2	  I did quite a bit of research on zoom lenses in this range and decided that this would be the one I would purchase . I am glad I did . The quality is superb and having the Image Stabilization really makes it a pleasure to take pictures in less than perfect lightening conditions . I would recommend this lens to any and everyone .  
1	  * WARNING * DO NOT BUY THIS VCR / DVD * WARNINGThis stuff is total garbage . Looks like I will eat the cost of this , however its not too late to save yourself . Buy ANYTHING else . I am on the second unit that does not and has not worked at all . GO-VIDEO SUCKS . Are they still in buisiness ? Easily the worst electronics I have ever had the misfortune of buying . It has now locked me out of my TV . I rue the day and you will too , if you buy this horrible equipment  
1	  I 'll start by saying that I have found reception to worse than the $ 20 clock radio it replaced . For it 's small footprint , the sound is nicer than one would expect to come out of a small radio . However , in no way is it as nice as a small set of decent bookshelf speakers . It just can't produce the accurate highs that come from a seperate tweeter , nor can it produce low end frequencies with any real presence ( I am NOT referring to boomy bass here ) . Overall , the sound is a bit tinny . It would make a great clock radio if they improved the reception , and it was 1/4 the price . That 'll never happen , though , because too many people have fallen for the gimmicky Bose sound .  
2	  Perfect pack for a couple of lenses and a couple of flash units . The interior is very easy to reconfigure the pocketing . Shoulder straps are multiple adjusting and well padded . I LIKE .  
1	  I was quite shocked at the poor performace of this radio / CD . I couldn't get any AM stations and only 3 FM stations . The FM radio stations were so scratch it was driving me crazy . The audio quality of the CD was very tinny and made it diffcult to hear the music . NO BASS at all and no tone controls at all .  
2	  i just love my new digital camera , it takes very clear pics . it has everything you need in a digital camera  
1	  I hooked the amp up and it wouldnt do anything it has power in all the Places its supposed to major disappointment i dont even know how it sounds yet .  
1	  I purchased this product in Febuary of 2008 . I used an ipod that would no longer hold a charge without being placed in the docking position , everything was fine for 4 years . Then the unit just stopped working , no display no alarm no nothing . In the for end it cost me about $ 15.00 a year alarm service . Positive : The sound was decent and it charged the ipod . Negitives : It broke , the clock led lighting was like having a lighthouse in your bedroom . Remote control only worked if you were 6 inches from the unit . Oh ya it broke , did already say that ?  
1	  I bought this to use as an adapter in my car . It plays only poor quality mono , not stereo as the product description states . I 'm getting a refund .  
1	  well i own it for two days and it already giving me trouble like half way into the movie it freezes with all the movies and so it start playing from the beginning but then i had to go thru it to find were i was and i well and it seem it be playing fine but it do it again and it also started as if the motor on it about to go out and also own another gpx dvd before but was not great either had that one for a month and the laser went out on that one too  
1	  I bought this laptop stand because of all the good reviews here but when I received this I was extremely disappointed and frustrated . This stand is very flimsy and bent almost immediately when I attempted to lock in the stand . Wobbly and not reliable , my laptop slipped off the stand twice and cannot stay put . I would definitely not recommend this to anyone who has a 17 " laptop , perhaps a very small Mac would or iPad would be ok .  
2	  Very user friendly , perfect size for use excersizing , and riding the bus to games .  
1	  I am SO disappointed with this printer ! I review as many reviews as I could find on this printer before purchasing it . I had previously owned a Canon printer that I liked so I hoped this would be even better . I was searching for a good printer for printing photos . The Pixma MP500 worked great for the first 18 months , then it developed a HEAVY black line on the BOTTOM of each page printed ! I tried all the cleaning options offered by Canon on their website - none worked . I even emailed Canon 's customer support and was told I could either take it in for repair ( at my own expense since it was out of warranty ) or they offered me 10 % off a new printer - from their website . I think I 'll be looking at Epson for my future printer needs . :(  
1	  I have this one and really dislike it . it skips way too easily ! ( I had it on the table and when someone dropped a book on the table , it skipped for about 10 seconds ! ) don't get it , I ' m goning to get the Sony De-350 real soon and replace this one !  
2	  Setup wasn't too bad , I did it myself without the auto setup . Range is very good in my house and it has 3 settings for signal power .  
2	  I love this product . I work from home answering phone 's and the sound quality is amazing . I haven't had a bit of trouble out of it as far as sound quality but you do have to get your ear use to it . It was a little un-comfortable for about the first week . But now I couldn't do my job with out . It is so much easier and comfortable than the over the head strap sets . Plus you don't have to worry about this style messing up your hair if you have some place to be after work . I would recommend this product to anyone looking to get a new headset .  
2	  Works great ! The best headphones I 've owned yet ! Got great reviews so I went for it . A spectacular deal . Purchased it without the original package but everything works perfectly so far .  
1	  I knew when I was buying this cable that it was a cheapo . But , I figured it would at least work to some extent . Although my VOM tests it with good continuity .. it will not work when plugged into an iPod and a Bose Wave radio . All I could get was a little bit of static . I ordered out a Monster cable and not only does it work but , it works very well . I 'll just mark this up to my own stupidity for ordering out a POS cable . I got what I deserved for that mistake and I will chalk it up as tuition in my learning experience . Instead of buying crap and then having to by the good stuff anyway . Why waste the money .. buy the good stuff first .  
2	  I bought this for our little one 's 8th birthday . She loves it . Easy to figure out for her , good sound quality , plus a clear FM radio signal . perfect for the price . Her CD 's play quickly , and remove easily . Plus it 's lightweight . It plugs in , or can be carried around with batteries . A GOOD DEAL . PS . For whatever reason , the shipping was super slow .. Amazon usually ships quickly , but this took over 2 weeks to get here . :(  
1	  My printer would not accept one of my ink cartridges . HP support sent me to India for " tech support " which wanted to charge me $ 39.95 to speak to representative . I told them my printer was fine I just needed to replace a faulty cartridge and refused to pay them a fee to return an item . After an hour and 6 representatives later , I ran out of time . The cost of replacing the cartridge is $ 65 but my sanity is priceless .  
2	  I bought this microphone to record live music and also to record my own music . In the past I used the built-in mic in my mini tape recorder , but there was always a background hiss , and if I didn't have my recorder right near the source it sounded poor . Since the Jensen mic is so cheap I bought it instead of the " earbuds " I was going to buy ( which would have done the job , but they aren't meant for taking IN sound ) . Don't let the price fool you , this microphone is EXCELLENT . 95 percent of the hiss during silence is gone , and during music there is no hiss . Everything sounds clear . It even picks up the sound of me quietly humming all the way across the room . Not many cheap mics can do that . Plus it clips on to almost anything . A very worthy investment .  
1	  I bought this two weeks ago and looked forward to getting it . However I was very disappointed that it would not play my homemade movie collection . The only discs it would play are store bought movies . Everything else freezes up within minutes of starting . Picture quality was good and I thought the menus , remote , and general ease of use was fine , but that is besides the point if you can't watch your movie .  
2	  Used it to keep my old roommate 's friends from stealing my laptop , they had already stolen my phone charger , and worked wonderfully !  
2	  Do you remember when walkmans came out ? They were a must have for anyone . Same thing for portable CD players . Well MP3 players are the new Walkman , and I can't figure out how I lived without one . The IPod Shuffle is a darn good product . It is designed to be a portable source of music that doesnt require a PhD to figure out , and doesn't cost half your paycheck . Having resisted the IPOD craze for 2 years , I finally found something that fits my needs exactly . Good Things : 1 . Low cost : I don't know about you , but $ 100 for this and the software is well worth the money . Instead of dozens of CDs everywhere , everything is neatly organized on my computer , and my Shuffle lets me download what I want , when I want , in the space of two minutes , and take it anywhere I want to go . 2 . Portability : This thing is unbelievably small and light . It fits in a pocket and you forget its there . Perfect for the gym or jogging , perfect for just sitting in the book store . 3 . Ease of Use : This thing is incredibly simple to use . Play , Pause , Volume Up , Volume Down , Track Forward Track Back . Shuffle Play , Playlist Order Play . That 's it . No scrolling through endless menus , no struggling to learn the functions . 4 . Compatibility : USB port to upload and download music , acts as a charger , simple as that . Software is incredibly easy to use , and very well organized . Negatives : Some feel that 512MB is not enough for a player and don't like not having a display , and while a FM tuner would be nice if I wanted a radio I would get a radio . It really depends on your personal tastes . 512MB is about 100 songs , or roughly 9 hours of music at a shot . Battery lasts 12 . For those who want their entire catalog at their fingertips , then the memory and the the lack of display is a negative , but I don't miss it . I like being surprised by what the next song is . All in all , for what it is meant to be , it is great . It 's great as a primary player and great as a way to dip into the world of IPOD without shelling out a fortune . Postscript : One Month later , one negative : Loading from another ITUNES Set up you cant transfer to yours due to Flash Memory . A bit annoying that .  
2	  I love this product ! I can stay on the treadmill for 2 hours if I am watching a good movie . The headphones are not great so I changed them out with my MP3 headphones . The picture is clear and the machine plays well . It is also great on the airplane and in the airport . I even travel with it and watch movies in my hotel room . This is definitely a good buy .  
2	  I purchased the Sony DSC-S75 back in June and have found it to be an excellent camera . I shopped around and did the research thing and this was the ticket . As other reviews have stated , the 8mb is a joke . I bought a 64mb and then a 128mb . I used the 128 this weekend for a birthday party and could not use it up . I have found that I can get about 81 shots on the finest setting with the 128mb . As far as picture quality .. it is superb ! The macro lets you take beautiful crisp clear shots on flowers , close ups on faces , whatever . I went hog wild and bought the tripod , Sony flash , lense adapter , wide angle lense , and filters . All I can say is if you are looking for a great camera , this is it . Highly recommend reading all of the manual . Battery life : have never lost power and I have been taking LOTS of pictures .  
1	  I bought this to solve the one HDMI input problem and I did a dumb thing , I just walked into the store and bought this blindly . After plugging it in and getting no picture what so ever with the a3 i tried it on some other devices and worked fine . Its just the A3 and from other reports it has Handshake issues and stutters at times . Back it goes to the store !  
1	  This item works fine as a small portable radio but myself and many others who bought this item found that the flash memory was defective . Unfortunately the store I bought it from will no longer accept it for return and Cowon 's tech support is non-existant . I would recommend you shop for a different audio player .  
1	  My laptop , iPad , and iPhone constantly disconnect from the Internet when connected to this router . When dropped , all devices still show that they are connected to the network , but even if I try to ping the router ( 192.168.0.1 ) , no response is received . My only fix is to power cycle the router , which gives me connectivity for 5-10mins and cuts out again . Wired connections seem to work just fine , but wireless have never worked correctly with this router . I 've upgraded the firmware to the latest build as well as reset the router back to factory settings multiple times , but the issue persists . Router is <2 months old and is already going in the trash . Unacceptable !  
2	  I still prefer these & # 34 ; cheap & # 34 ; Labtec microphones-of which I have owned or sold more than a few of-to headsets , for a number of reasons . I find these microphones generally have a much superior all-round audio quality and tend to last a lot longer : you could still use headphones with them , of course , but you don't have to worry about having the mic too close or too far from your mouth ( both of which are common problems with headset mics , where they either get too loud and carry unwanted noise , or get too faint with a quickness ) , and you don't have to worry about issues with USB drivers , or voice chat applications that will refuse to allow you to put the audio over your speakers while trying to use the headset mic . My only complaint with this particular model is that , while it 's not a feature I use often on mine ( the purchase I am reviewing here is one I bought for my wife ) , this one does not have the physical on / off ( or & # 34 ; mute & # 34 ;) switch that my other Labtec desk mic has , and it is indeed a nice feature when you want it . Otherwise , I will definitely continue using these mics over others .  
1	  DON'T BUY THIS ITEM ! This item is different than what is mailed . Poor quality , there is no yellow as EIO says . It 's big and bulky , with little support for laptop . Also forget returning the item , they will not cooperate . Beware of this company .  
2	  Length : 0:50 MinsWorks great on a telescope with internal focusing too .  
2	  I felt like a recording artist wearing these things . The sound is great . I bought mine through a Amazon . com " Gold Box Deal " They were a steal ! Nice product , well made , great sound .  
2	  update : i ordered another vanguard case , the VGC-13 , after i got this one . they make a good pair , but if you 're trying to choose one , get the other one . it 's bigger and less expensive with the same quality . ( otherwise , you 'll end up getting it anyway as your gear selection grows . ) in retrospect , i would recommend this more as storage for just your camera ( w / cables , memory cards , filters , speedlight ) or if you have a small ( 2-3 lens ) outfit . get the vgc-13 if you have a lot of lenses ( more than 5 ) and / or a long telephoto lens . i ordered the vanguard hard case because i didn't want to just toss my extra lenses in a backpack . also , i live in california , so you never know when an earthquake might hit . when it arrived today-beating the shipping estimate by over a week-i was fairly impressed out of the box . it 's brushed aluminum hardware and sides , backed with slightly ribbed ABS plastic on the outside . on the inside , there 's a waffle-foam top , a two-layer foam bottom , several rubber section dividers , and a dice-pattern foam sheet . the dividers slide together into any number of configurations , the foam can be used to custom-fit pieces . you also get two keys for the front locks and a shoulder strap that clips onto the side . it 's a rugged-seeming package that doesn't look cheap , but is a bit on the small side-amazon offers no specs , but this is the VGP-13S model , the dimensions are 15.75 " x 9.9 " x 6.9 " - although compact might be a more politically-correct term . after loading it up with some gear , here 's what i was able to fit into it : - 70-300 tele w / hood-12-24 wide angle w / hood-15 fisheye w / hood-50 prime-flash-two 3-filter kits and 3 loose filters-two extra batteries . obviously , this is not a solution to hold all your gear if you have much more than 2 lenses and one body . then again , the relatively small size does offer a degree of portability , even if its just from one end of your studio to another . the handle 's nice and sturdy , but the nonpadded strap would probably get uncomfortable after more than about 5 minutes , although the case isn't all that heavy loaded up , unless you fill it with bricks or something . I decided to give the Vanguard 5 stars because this unit did what i wanted it to do , which was secure my gear in the event of any unforseen accidents , like accidentally siting on a lens or filter i 've left on the couch . even without cutting out the foam and fitting them into the partitioned dividers , it held the gear steady in the upright position-no jostling or rustling . i may leave the foam sheet untouched , so i can reconfigure it easier , but if you want to have a dedicated home for specific items you don't always need in your camera bag , this isn't a bad choice . i couldn't fit some of my lens pouches , cables , and the like , but those things aren't as in dire need of being properly secured as all your precious glass and / or body ( s ) , so no biggie . overall , this is a versatile case that 's just big enough to be a stay-at-home unit , and just small enough to venture out w / you on a shoot . does exactly what you 'd expect , has a professional appearance , and is a good looker to boot . if you 're an extreme gearhound , at the price it might be worth it to get two , although you might also want to look into the wheeled model , which is a bit bigger , for around twice the price , especially if you plan on carrying this around a lot . bottom line : why expose expensive glass and / or your camera to danger or possible damage ? protect your investment - after all , it 's cheaper than sending a bag full of lenses in for warranty service if your drunk uncle roy has a mishap while watching WWF or NASCAR .  
1	  Great price , but photos and videos written to this card by new Canon camera regularly became corrupted ( yellow question mark appears instead of image thumbnail when trying to view on camera ) . Have no such problems with Lexar card .  
2	  it does what i needed it to do , which is easy usb access to SD card memory . it does NOT do SDHC , however . even so , the vendor was ~ great ~ , and quickly sent me out a new one when the first one apparently got lost in the mail .  
2	  I bought this battery so I would have 2 to use at concerts and events . Great battery life , must have lasted at least 2 hours .  
1	  I agree totally with the above review - it simply does not " play " in a Sony 8mm camcorder . I tried it in both of mine , and all it did was pull the " tape " out of the shell and jam , requiring a manual removal as it did for the other reviewer . I don't know how we are going to clean these heads , now that the Sony dry cleaner is no longer available .  
1	  This cable was very inexpensive . I should have known that it would not work . The cabe itself is a very cheap made in China product , with very thin ( small gauge ) cord . Even if the cable did work , I doubt that it would have been able to work properly over 15 ft given the limitations on data transmission created by the very thin wire gauge .  
1	  I bought this card and two lexar firewire 800 compact flash card readers . First off , I was amazed to find out there isn't a Vista driver for this card . OK , I can deal . I downloaded the latest driver from Belkin on my wife 's T50 which has XP . Rebooted the machine with the card and the lexar compact flash reader installed . Nothing happens . No drive letter magically appears . What a piece of trash . Shame on you Belkin . J. Hart . P.S. their service department doesn't apparently answer emails either .  
1	  We bought this brand new a year ago and used it very little . The remote broke over the Christmas season , so I emailed customer service . They said no parts , including remote , are available , which makes the whole system unusable . You have to have a remote to turn it on and off - no power button on the unit . I bought new batteries , thinking it was just a dead battery , but no , the remote died . $ 150 about a year ago and completely unuseable system today , which no option to replace the remote .  
2	  I installed this within 15 minutes ( it was so easy to set up ) and have my network up and running in less than half an hour . Compared to the Linksys ( which I have returned to Amazon ) , I haven't experienced the need to " reset " the router every few days and the Netgear has been on for over 3 weeks now . I don't know if Linksys have updated their firmware so that one does not need to reset the connection but so far , I haven't experienced any downtime with the Netgear model . For those who are interested , I used this for my Verizon DSL account in Brooklyn , NY and one of the reasons I set up my connection so quickly is because I didn't need to install Verizon 's WinPOET and simply need to configure Windows 2000 Professional 's Network ( took a minute ! ) . The transmission is a lot smoother ( without the router , I would experience intermittent outtage ) and I have downloaded the entire RedHat Linux software as well as Oracle 's Oracle8i without any problem ( and those are HUGE files ) .  
2	  Great item , great price . Setup was a breeze . I hooked up my computer , dvd player , tv and printer in about 5 minutes  
2	  I got this item for $ . 02 , and it worked perfectly . I mean , it 's a cable , so it isn't like it 's got a ton of room to shine . However , for $ . 02 , it did a damn awesome job .  
1	  I have used many short length HDMI cables , This Cable 's ( 25 ft ) end pins just came out when I pulled from Projector slot .. Poor mold . I ordered another one from Amazon .  
2	  Excellent sound ( for all but the audiophile who writes a review below ) . Most people consider the sound better than the Onkyo CS210 . The one problem is with the reliability of the CD changer , whose door sometimes gets stuck and requires service . Thus if you 're going to buy this machine , you might want to consider a warranty extension . Despite this problem , no one has suggested to me an equally good machine in this price range for rich sounding music in a small room . This machine also has a hidden use : as a headphone-only system . Many rather expensive stereos have mediocre headphone output . Here , however , the headphone output is outstanding even with demanding headphones . I use headphones a lot and simply can't justify buying a headphone amplifier when this is so good .  
2	  Super product . Just what the wife wanted for her laptop . It makes it easier for her to use her laptop and it fits perfectly inside the cush top .  
1	  I keep reading reviews and articles about XM having near CD quality sound . It simply is not true . Out of all the formats I have heard which include ; SACD , CD , Minidisc , Cassette , VHS and FM , the SkyFi has got to be the least natural sounding . It has too many digital artifacts which make it unlistenable for any extended period of time . The concept is great but the audio quality is another step backwards for digital sound .  
1	  I cannot rate the item as it never worked and I had to return it . I am hoping the new one will be in working order .. it just arrived so I cannot say more . I was not overly pleased at the length of time it took to send me a new one .. I sent it UPS on Mar 6th and received the new on Mar 21 but only after I sent an email asking where it was . I was promised a $ 7.50 credit on the postage that I paid .. Have not seen that as yet but I am hopeful .  
2	  This is what I want when buying a boring component like this - easy to buy , comes to your door quickly , and works like you think it would .  
2	  Why spend the extra money when Amazon is cheaper ? The same product as you get at any number of office supply stores , but the convenience of getting it delivered to your door and for less !  
1	  My TV is only 4 years old and this is not compatible with it . It renders pictures very fuzzy and red from both the DVD palyer and the VCR . It has a buzz in the sound , doesn't have a remote , and is a huge disappointment . I really regret buying it , as it has failed on every level  
1	  This is one of the worst headphones interms of the manufacturing quality . I bought 1 headphone and after some days , the left speaker stopped working . I called support and reported about the failure . They sent me a replacement . The replacement headphones also had same problem . Then i was sick of calling and arguing with them . I went for Sennheiser Rs130 . It is worth for every penny and sounds great for both music and movies . I hook up my iPhone and listen to Pandora daily once i return from work .  
2	  I 'm so glad I found this product . I bought it to use on my new iHome IH15 , and it fits right in , it can charge the Shuffle or play it through the player . It does seem a little expensive for what it is , but it is a lot less expensive than buying a new iPod .  
1	  The Panasonic SLSX289V portable CD player is the poorest machinery I 've ever experienced using . It easily malfunctions when you put in a CD recordable disc , and there is no anti-shock button on the CD player , to prevent it from skipping . When I had to get this product fixed , Panasonic didn't do anything about it . Basically all that I got from this CD player , was a [ $ ] AM / FM radio . What a waste of good money . If you 're looking for a good portable CD player with a radio , get the Aiwa XP-R220 .  
1	  The star only pertains to the Owners Manual which is the worst I 've ever seen . Makes you want to start an ATS-909 support group . I emailed Sangean with questions - will update this review to let you know how they respond . More to follow on the radio itself once I figure out how to use it .  
1	  I agree with positive reviewers concerning the excellent precision and smooth performance of the G7 , but if you spend a decent amount of time on the computer daily you will hate this mouse and Logitech . What will happen is that you will quickly tire of having to swap to the spare battery every day or every other day . What 's worse is that you will soon realize that the G7 's batteries are propriety and there 's nothing you can do about it ( i.e. buying more powerful batteries ) short of returning the mouse . How Logitech can sell a premium mouse with no battery life is beyond me . I guess that 's why they give you the spare battery that is always charged . That , however , is just a band aid covering a power hungry design that is a great annoyance .  
2	  Bought this kit for the new radio in my ' 98 Ford Escort . Kit is relatively easy to install , though you 'll need to make some adjustments to the " inner lip " of the dash plastic to allow for clearance . Wiring harness fit perfectly . Only complaint is that the shape of the plate doesn't match the original design . The markings for A / C and heat controls are identical . Otherwise , it works well and was worth the cost .  
1	  The 1st time I used it it got stuck on the lens and was impossible to get it off . I ended up dropping the camera and breaking the bottom plate of the camera . This was the most expensive filter I ever bought .  
2	  I purchased the 350N to replace a defective Pre-N wireless router from another vendor . The storage link option caught my attention as I thought it 'd allow me to share mp3 files to other computers on the net without having to keep my main system on all the time . Setting up the unit was easy . I was able to configure the following items with ease : dynamic DNS service , remote access , shared storage , opening ports for remote desktop and slingbox , reserve some DHCP addresses and wireless security in a few minutes . I haven't been able to test the gigabit performance as I need to upgrade my network card , but I 'm sure that 'll work fine . Hooking up a 250GB USB 2 driver to the router was easy and sharing that to all the systems on the net works great . The 1.0 firmware had a bug that ocassionally dropped my shared storage , but the latest firmware seems to have fixed it . The only reason why I gave this 4 stars rather than 5 stars is that the range of the wireless signal seems smaller than my previous pre-n router from the other vendor . At the same location of system and router , my signal appears to be about 30 % weaker than with the previous router . This limits my mobility with the laptop for now , pending moving around the router to other locations . But a good wireless router with good features and easy to use and setup .  
1	  The video as stated in other reviews is great . The best I have seen in KVMs . The fact that it is all USB is fantastic as well . The delay in detecting the keyboard is tolerable . The reason for the low rating for me is that there is no quick key combination that allows the user to change from one computer to another via a keyboard key stroke . What was Startech thinking making a KVM that doesn't allow the user to hit a key combination to change from one computer to another . I have never heard of that from any other KVM . That is so worthless to me . I have to add one more large object to my desktop so that I can switch between computers or I have to get up from my workstation and press the button to go from one machine to the next . That is the worst mistake I could ever imagine . Startech is lucky I work on a government site that took 3 months just to get all the red tape to order , ship , and recieve the switches I wanted or else I would send them back ! That is the lamest thing I have ever seen . If you don't mind button pushing then go ahead and buy this switch , otherwise you 'll be highly disappointed .  
2	  For the money , this is a great deal , especially if you 're not a person who 's going to have 50,000 address entries , write a lot of email on their Palm , download War and Peace on it , or for any other reason need 8MB of memory . It 's very reliable and is a nice size and shape . The flip-top cover is very convenient . Also , the new Note Pad program , which comes with the software and which lets you write freehand notes with the stylus , is really useful for those quick little notes you need to jot down . The only drawbacks : - small screen - it uses AA batteries ( instead of being rechargeable ) - its screen surface isn't as smooth and slick as the more expensive Palm models , so it can be slightly harder to write on  
2	  After having a Harmon Kardon receiver for almost 20 years that died a graceful death , my purchase before this TEAC was only about 2 years ago ( big mistake was the latest purchase - a " refurbished " product from another vendor . Within 2 years it had a significant background hum ) . I really like this TEAC unit for several reasons . I have never had a receiver with a remote , and it is nice to not have to keep opening and closing the audio center doors to operate it . More importantly to me is the fact that I have seen very few audio receivers that support a turntable , and I have a great collection of old vinyl - sometimes I like to reminisce ! For those interested , my needs are for more background music , so I can't comment on how it sounds amped up full tilt , but overall , I think this was a great value and suits my needs just fine .  
1	  I purchased this item because my other adapters tend to " click " when in use . Not only did this product click , but the auto reverse would not stop flipping , and my car eventually just popped out the cassette . This happened in two different cars I tried it in . I guess I 'll go back to my " clicking but working great " Phillips adapter .  
1	  Umm yeah , unless you 're used to carrying around a massive photo kit , I 'll bet this will not seem like a small bag to you . Like other reviews have stated , it 's so darn blocky , like a cooler , I can't imagine using it when I travel . It almost seems like this is really just designed to transport equipment ( like on a plane and then into a hotel ) but not necessarily to use in the field . Maybe it 's me , but I was basically expecting a holster type bag with a little extra room for a flash , filter and other accessories . This is not that bag .  
2	  I purchased the IM3C for husband when we noticed during a recent trip abroad that we had no way of listening to music in our hotel room . We plugged it in on Chrismas day for our holiday party and it worked great and delivered great sound and significant volume for such a small , well priced unit while providing great design . It folds up so small and flat for travel and comes with plug adapters ( for use internationally ) and a travel case plus an a / c adapter . The I Pod unit clicks into the front of the unit and takes up so little space then the unit folds flat for storage . I 've seen other travel speaker systems that are bulky and poorly designed and this one has a much better design and the fact that it charges the I Pod while it 's attached means that you can leave your charger at home . This system was a hit and I 'm glad I went with this model .  
2	  I bought a sub that didn't have an LFE out just a L and R line in . This cable works perfectly . I plugged it into the R line in and immediately heard my booms . I was worried at first when I figured out I had to buy a cable because they are all expensive and not very long . NOT THE CASE HERE . This is an amazing deal . 25 foot long cable for under $ 10 ! Don't waste your money on a monster cable . This cable will do the job just fine .  
2	  Overall this package is well worth it . The mouse and keyboard look great and are very well designed . I will never switch back to corded anything on my desktop . they work well from about 10 feet away . Negatives :* the keyboard doesn't react instantly . As another reviewer said , there is a slight but noticeable delay between the time you push a key and the time the letter appears onscreen . I got used to it . * the programmable buttons on the keyboard are useful , but often don't work . this * the mouse turns itself off after a few seconds of non-use to save battery . the problem is that rolling the scroll wheel does not wake wake the mouse back up . you have to move the mouse side to side to use the scroll wheel . annoying when you 're reading a long document .  
1	  Everything worked fine at first , but I noticed as soon as I installed the drivers , I started to get frequent BSoDs ( atleast 2 times a day ) . After looking for a fix , it seems that Belkin has no plans to fix this , and no existing fix . Stay away from this product if you own a computer running XP  
2	  Other reviews might have experienced the same problem as mine . When 4GB Portable Storage USB 2.0 High Speed Flash Drive began to be available in the market , I spend hundreds of dollars to buy a Brand Name product . However , it was the first time 4 gigabyte of data can be stored in a small device , USB Flash Drive ; therefore , technology of most products was still having problem and must be improved . After a period of time , new technology of High Speed Flash Drive is well-developed and 4GB USB 2.0 High Speed Flash Drive becomes available with so many manufacture names such as Lexar , Transcend , Verbatim , etc .. 4GB USB 2.0 High Speed Flash Drive is now available with some different technologies and still cost a lot of money . Because of having problem spending too much money for the first 4GB USB Flash Drive , I carefully searched for affordable product and luckily found this Generic 4GB USB 2.0 High Speed Flash Drive in BLUE color , not Black Leather Accents . This product works much better than the first one I got and it is worth my money . Data transfer is very fast with High Speed USB 2.0 port and storage of photos is very reliable . So , I highly recommended my relatives and friends to buy it and I also bought one more .  
2	  the headphones are very nice and the sound comes in real clear and the bass is really good .  
2	  Works Good and recived ontime . Greatly improves the speed and performance of older computers . Easy to install works as expected  
1	  This TV had a beautiful picture , for the first 5 months then died . Mfg . Warranty specifically states Philips has the right to send out a refurbished TV as the replacement , it took 2 months to arrive from Ohio . The replacement lasted 33 days and began to turn itself off . Contact w / Philips Cust . Service , again they stated per policy , they want to send another refurbished model or a LCD TV instead of the plasma unit . Research indicates this mfg . is no longer making plasma TV 's for US distribution , parts and repair are almost impossible even on a 5 month old TV , opps , 33 day old TV . Recent discussion w / six independent repair services has informed me this model has been , and I quote , " a dog from day one " .. It 's football season and my brand new big screen is no longer working ! This TV has been broken more time than it has been operable since I purchased it in Dec . 2007 .. SAVE YOUR MONEY , BUY ANYTHING ELSE , DONATE IT TO CHARITY , BUT DON'T GIVE YOUR HARD EARNED $ TO PHILIPS !  
2	  I 've never written a review for any of the many items that I have purchased from [ .. ] , but I just had to write a review for this one . All I can say is " wow ! " I 'm not sure why I waited so long to get a good subwoofer for my stereo system . The low-end music reproduction for music AND movies is OUTSTANDING ! I am using Monster XP stranded speaker wire , so I can't comment on the sound quality with the speaker wire that came with the unit . Be sure to experiment with different amplification levels and cut-off frequencies ( adjustable on the unit ) .  
2	  Very well made , and looks great , even in the bedroom . Took less than 20 minutes to install and mount my 15 " LCD TV . Very pleased with this purchase .  
1	  The cordless mouse is great , BUT .. the keyboard I have is a pain in the bum ! the spacebar and several of the letter keys are prone to sticking right out of the box . I realize that I may have just got lucky and got the only lemon made by logitech ( sometimes S # ! T happens ) ! . But since they are sold as a pair I can't give a high score .  
1	  there is no pen in the stylus , if you 're looking for a combined stylus with pen , keep on looking forward this stylus is not like pictured  
1	  Most credit cards ( Amex , Visa ) offer loss and damage protection , and extended warranty protection . Amex , for example , doubles the manufacturer 's warranty up to and for at least 1 year . Research your credit card benefits before investing 20-25 % of the product cost in extended warranty protection . I think it 's worthless .

2	  I needed a tool to find out what my electricity consumption was on various appliances , this was used to allocate my usage for an off grid PV system . works well , on one of the appliances , my calculations were higher than what was actually consumed .  
2	  This S-Video cable is perfect for my use . I use this cable to hook up theSima SVS-14 4 Input Manual A / V Selectorto my TV . That box outputs with a composite cable , but also with this S-Video cable to carry any S-Video signals that are inputted to that AV switcher to the TV . This cable is build sturdy and seems to work well . The 6 foot length is perfectly adequate for my needs ; it 's not too short and not too long .  
1	  This thing is such a scam ! It is nothing but a doorstop unless you pay for their $ 100 + per year service ! They do a great job of hiding this fact ! The Amazon product desciption has no obvious notice . Neither does the box ! My wife didn't find out until she was on their website reading the FAQ trying to figure out how to work this thing . The only place she saw it is in a question , " Can I use CEIVA BROADBAND to send pictures directly to my Receiver from my computer ? " . Buried between-the-lines amongst some marketing B.S. is the answer : " CEIVA BROADBAND is an exciting new technology that lets your Digital Photo Receiver download pictures by using your existing high-speed Internet connection . Pictures you wish to transfer from your camera or computer to your Receiver must first be uploaded to your CEIVA account . From there , your pictures may be downloaded to your Receiver . You can learn more about CEIVA BROADBAND by clicking here . " Their boxes and all product descriptions should have a very clear " * Additional Rediculous Subscription Fee Required " . Also , their " Broadband Kit " is pretty much just a USB cable to plug into their USB port . But their FAQ says that only their specific $ 25 cable will work . So they take a standard and mutilate it so it becomes proprietary in order to suck another $ 25 out of you .. is this thing designed by Microsoft or something ? Customer service sucked , too ! My wife bought this for me for Xmas . It took her 2-weeks to get it working and loaded with pictures because you can't do ANYTHING until the unit is registered . When she tried to register , it said that the unit was already in use ( We must have had a unit that someone else tried and returned .. seems to be a trend ) . She sent e-mails that * never * got a response . When she called their customer service line , she was given the option to leave a message or wait for the estimated 15-minutes . She decided to wait since she needed to get it working immediately . After 15-minutes of waiting , it redirected her to voicemail anyway ! The voicemail was finally returned 2-WEEKS LATER ! They lied and said that it was not already in use and that that batch of unit codes hadn't been entered into the system yet . What a crock ! So why did I give it 2-stars instead of a much deserved 1 ? Because the overall concept is great . But with the required service fee , it is really only worth it for a specific target audience : Keeping grandparents that live across the country happy . They can get new digital pictures of their grandkids without ever owning a computer . For everyone else , just post a photo album on a website . I guess there are also the tech-addicts that will get it just to have it . Now I 'm out the return S & H ; since Amazon considers this " not their fault " . Great ..  
1	  I purchased the Black & Decker 100 watt laptop Power To Go cordless AC / USB power supply to use to exclusivelypower my ipod . I recently went to California on vacation and I wanted to extra run-time power for viewing video 's on my iTouch . I paid fifty dollars for the power supply and discovered that the unit would not run my iTouch for very long . I attempted to recharge the unit several times but each time I got the same results . the power supply will not hold a charge and immediately drops down to zero . i am lucky to get one recharge andperhaps two hours of run time on my iTouch . this unit supposedly designed to run a laptop computer ! I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED with the performance of the product and can not recommend this device . I also notice that the manufacturing date stamped on the device was early 2007 which leads to wonder if the batteries have developed a short chemical memory due to the extended shelve time . I hope this review helps . Save your money and find something that actually works .  
2	  This does just what it says it will do . The adapter works , it is reasonably priced . What more do you want ?  
1	  It 's hard to believe that some of the reviewers actually own this player .. Are we really talking about the Toshiba HD-XA2 , I paid GRAND Total of $ 787.83 , That was back in February ; when you got 3 free HD DVD 'S . Now it 's around $ 500.00 and you get 5 free DVD 's ( you tell me ) . It plays regular DVD just fine , but is very temperamental when it comes to playing HD DVD 'S . Your disc better not even have a hair of a scratch , or it stops and will NOT play again , I have tried to reload , reset , and go a little past , fast forward through . Forget it ! So if you don't mind watching an hour and a half of a movie and missing 15 minutes in the middle , this is your player . Thankfully some of the HD DVD 's can be turned over and played in standard format . You 'll need this feature if you want to see the rest of the movie . Although , once you have been watching it in HD , you can really notice the difference , so it kind of pisses you off for the rest of the movie . I ordered firmware today , hopefully that solves my problems . One of those things , that maybe I should have waited a little longer .  
2	  We put one of these on a 10 ' wide x 9 ' tall 2 1/2 " thick insulated door on our pole barn and love it ! It works great and is quiet . I think it took less time to install than the last center mount door opener I installed but that was about 20 years ago . We just purchased 3 more of these to install on our new attached garage and are in the process of installing them . The nice thing about these is that you can get by with less clearance above the door because everything mounts on the side . This actually allowed us to design in taller doors without pushing the roof line way up . This was important because of an 8'3 " high door that we needed . If you have questions don't hesitate to contact me .  
2	  Filter arrived promptly , was best price I found for this - fits Nikon 18-55 and 55-200 lens . Recommend this item .  
2	  Decent sound . Nothing kick - ass , but good for its value . This are just " yet another " ear-plugs . Not much of a noise isolation unless you keep the volume high ..  
2	  This works really well , its cheap and was delivered fast . I like this charger over the manufacturers one since this seemed a bit more high quality ( yeah , was surprised myself ) .  
1	  At first I thought that this camera was wonderful BUT it has a lot of things wrong with it .. 1 . It is NOT for fast picture taking , it takes a lot of time for the shutter to close ! 2 . If you don't have an arm made of stone then you will get extremely blurry night shots . 3 . Goes through battery EXTREMELY quickly4 . There is a very slow rebooting time between shots5 . Zoom is choppy and hard to use6 . Only some of the photos come out when uploaded7 . Without the flash the pictures are very , very blurryBut this camera is extremely easy to use just take it out of the box and use it .  
1	  Fast rewind and forward speeds are great for skipping from one program to another but stopping at a desired spot is frustrating . The remote it terrible . After one month it stopped working . Sony site said to remove the batteries and then press each button twice . This fix lasted about 5 minutes . You must constantly remove the battery and put it back in to get the remote to work . Just programing the VCR is a chore with this remote - removing and replacing the battery for almost every programing item . I bought a new identical Sony remote and it developed the same problem in about a week !  
2	  I did much research on headphones and cables and headphone amps to drive them . I had to do all this on a small budget . I got the HD 650 and the Cardas cable upgrade 15 ' and took a giant leap and got the Creek 21se headphone amp and the Audioquest King Cobra RCA and hooked it up to the CA Azur 640c v1 CD player and replaced it 's stock cord with the Audioquest NRG-2 power cord and removed it 's black RF ferrite noise stopper . Also got the Monster SW200 surge protector with stage 1 clean power circuitry to plug the CD player and the amp in to . Also added three model 2 vibrapods for CD player . Next it takes quite a long time before I could reap the benifits of these combinations . In other words there is a break in period for most of these purchuses . After playing a CD for an extended period of time of about 80 hours I 've reached what what everybodys been raving about ; the ultimate nirvana . It 's just miraculous the sound quality that comes though these set of headphones . You don't know what you missing just listening though speakers . These headphones are far more engaging . It 's worth noting that if you not able to make some of these sacrifices you should look at another headphone . It takes alot of power to drive these headphones and nothing short of an amp just won't do . When all is said and done it set me back about$1400 . With this large investment I 'm thrilled to have years of high quality headphone listening . Update : Four months later : Incredible , Extraordinary , Phenomenal .  
1	  It a good idea but very hard to get a screw in a hard drive cause you have put a screw driver with a screw in holes along the sides just to get to the screw hole . If you have big fingers then you have a problem . The Cool Master 4 in 3 is better because you can take the sides off to get to the hard drive screws holes .  
2	  Kyocera Finecam S3This is a fantastic camera ! It is a great high-resolution , point-and-shoot , digital camera for the amateur photographer in a package so small that you WILL take it with you . This is my first digital camera . I borrowed a Kodak 1.3M camera , and after countless hours of research was about to buy the Cannon S20 when I saw a reference to the Kyocera Finecam S3 . After some investigation I found that Kyocera is the parent company for Yashica / Contax . I am familiar with Contax because my first camera is a Contax 139 which I bought 20 years ago and have loved ever since . Contax has the exclusive license to distribute world renowned Carl Zeiss T * lenses . I wanted a digital camera that took very good pictures and was small enough that I would be willing to carry with me . I have found over the years that quite often I will not have even a point-and-shoot camera with me because I don't want to carry it . This camera is so small ( the length and width of a credit card ) that it easily fits in the pocket of my jeans . The optics on this camera are fantastic , it takes great pictures . I bought a 64MB memory card and always shoot in the high-resolution mode because it is easy to cut a picture down later on the computer . Other than buying a larger memory card , this camera comes COMPLETE with rechargeable battery , 120/240v charger , carrying case , USB adaptor and some OK software . The movie mode is pretty wimpy . It looks a bit like a 1960 's home movie and there is no sound . But then again this is NOT A MOVIE CAMERA . My mother enjoys the short-grainy movies of her grandchildren . The viewfinder is small , but you can zoom in 2x and pan around when viewing a picture . The con 's of the camera are : 1 ) The battery will only last about 32-64 pictures , then you have to recharge . 2 ) The memory card that comes with it is too small . Buy a bigger one . 3 ) The flash is only good for 8-10 feet ( like most point-and-shoots ) . 4 ) There is no setting to make the LCD panel default to OFF . 5 ) It takes about 1.5 seconds to actually take a picture . Maybe most digitals are like this . 6 ) The movie mode is only 320 X 240 and there is no sound . But remember , this is a STILL camera , not a camcorder . The pro 's are : 1 ) Great still pictures including macro mode . 2 ) So small that you will take it with you . 3 ) Nicely designed and built . Easy to use controls . 4 ) No nose prints on the display because it is right beneath the viewfinder . 5 ) Rechargeable battery included ( although is it proprietary ) . 6 ) Charger is 120-240V . 7 ) Has automatic lens cover to keep the lens clean . 8) Options to display more or less in the LCD panel .  
1	  i have only had the HDVT for a little over a year - and i do NOT watch that much TV . Yet - i see a line ( red ) running through my TV - totally unacceptable for more than $ 2,000 spent - when my prior LCD lasted 5 years ( and I bought the FLOOR MODEL ) , and my OLD Zenith TV - old school - had beautiful picture for 10 years . disappointed . My brother 's HDTV looked just fine - wish I had read more reviews first - but had heard very good news ..  
2	  I recently was faced with the task of either buying a new computer or rebuilding one that had bit the dust . For several reasons I chose the latter . As part of the rebuild I chose to upgrade to a dual core processor . I chose this unit for two reasons .. features and price . My original chip as a single core at 2.4G with a 512K L2 cache and rated on the cpubenchmark scale at 592 . I wanted to go to a dual core equivalent which would be a X2 4600 or 4800 , but both of these were very pricy since these are discontinued .. try around 400 bucks for a used X2 4800 . The price is because these are a socket 939 processor . Anyway , the 4400 is a 2.2G processor with dual 1M L2 caches . The price was very reasonable ( found one for 125 through Amazon marketplace ) and is now installed after receipt of a higher capacity sink / fan combo and is running great . The cpubenchmark for this chip is 1195 so I expect it to run somewhat faster , but currently I have no real demanding applications to prove such . It does appear that windows loads faster , the initial desktop screen pops into place with all icons loaded , whereas before they would load in batches . Windows defintely closes down faster . All in all , it seems to be running faster and the numbers say it is a faster chip . I am pleased with my purchase and the Amazon Marketplace vendor ( Extreme975 ) was a pleasure to work with . I would definitely use them again if the opportunity arose .  
2	  I bought a pair of these to put in the corners of my covered patio in the back yard . Easy to install and wire up . Using with a Pyle mini amp and both the speakers and amp are plenty loud for my intended purposes . Couldn't find a pair of indoor / outdoor speakers locally for anywhere near the low price of these on Amazon . Highly recommended !  
2	  I bought mine years ago , around Christmas on sale . I 'm a gamer , I have tried a lot different mice : Logitech G5 , Wolfking , Razor Habu and Orochi . Nothing floated my boat , as much as this mouse . As much of a pounding , abuse , and batteries I 've given it , it still clicked , scrolled , and tracked like new . I gamed for 16 hours ( or more ) on my weekends with this . I never installed the software and I just used the default settings , and loved it . I may have not used it to it 's fullest , though . Worked well in Win XP , Vista ( Ugh , I know ) , Win 7 , and Linux . It has never once double clicked on me ( sign your mouse is about to die-I know ) . Pro 's : It 's small . It 's very portable . Comfy to use for hours . Withstands repeated clicking abuse . Tracking is decent . Lag is barely noticeable . Crisp and authoritative scrolling and clicking . Even after a few years . Logitech build quality is present . Very durable , and solid . Dongle stores inside the mouse for travel . Slight heft for it 's size . Even with out the battery . Con 's : It 's small . No case . Eats batteries if your a power user . Battery changes can be difficult . Let me explain some of my cons first . Small , if you have sausage fingers , or you can palm a basketball , this mouse may not be for you . The battery cover is a small , removable sliding panel . The strap to pull the battery out , can be a die hard b * to grasp . I 'm used to grasping small wiring , and small parts , and I really disliked battery changing on this . It 's bearable , but a chore still . No case , pouch , or nice velvet baggy comes with this . I 've had some quality computer components come with nice velvet bags . This only comes in a box with paperwork instructions , software cd , dongle , and the mouse itself . Most laptop cases , and bags have pockets for mice anyway . Do you really have to double bag this ? Batteries . Yea big thing here . Aside from the chore of battery changing , this mouse will eat them if your a power user . I used mine on a gaming desktop environment , and fed it Duracells like candy . Fact : I swapped cases from a 1st revision Cooler Master 690 , to an Antec 900 , not for the fancy window , but for the top tray . Why ? So I could keep a stash of fresh batteries handy . Well that was one reason .. I know I spent more on batteries , than the cost of two of these . But I loved this mouse . I would rate the mouse5/5 quality5/5 ergonomics3.5/5 battery life3/5 battery changing5/5 durability4.5/5 overallThis mouse seems discontinued now , and I hope Logitech has a replacement for it in the works . The mouse I based my experiences on , it still alive and kicking to this day ( after almost three years ) . I 've decided to retire mine and give it to someone who could make use of it ( beside laying around a shoe box with other mice ) .  
1	  This product might fit other XBox 360 's but not a first generation . I will not plug into the power supply block . Bummer ..  
1	  I was very disappointed in this picture frame . While this frame does have a very high resolution , it has virtually NO side viewing angle . If you aren't staring at it directly face on , then it starts to get overly-bright and washed out , or overly dark and difficult to see - depending on the angle you are viewing it at . It also has difficulty choosing the correct orientation for a picture . If you edit the pictures in an image editor - like Photoshop - then it seems to get them right . But straight out of a camera it often gives you a " sideways " photo in the frame . There is also a design problem with the Compact Flash card slot . It is very finicky and if you even slightly misalign the card as you are inserting it into the frame , it can fall into the sealed back of the frame . This is VERY easy to do , and I was fortunate to be able to get my card to fall back out of the slot . But it is a design flaw that had to be apparent to any testers and easily fixed by enclosing the slot so that the card couldn't fall through . Westinghouse apparently decided that this was just something we would have to deal with . Finally , it arrived with a bright blue " dead pixel " in the center of the screen . This was not noticable on bright , " busy " pictures , but it stood out like a sore thumb on dark pictures and particularly on flesh-toned scenes - like , well - you know - people 's faces . As a comparison , I also own the Matsunichi frame which has been flawless . I expected more from a company like Westinghouse . There are better frames out there . ONE OTHER NOTE : BEWARE - if you order this through Amazon but actually purchase it through Electronics Express , you have an entirely different ( and worse ) return policy which even though the product might be defective , requires you to pay shipping and limits your returns to 15 days . Look carefully before you order - if it isn't from AMAZON then you are probably up a creek if there are problems .  
2	  You will find my original review below . I added this 2 weeks after I purchased it and started having some seriously screwy operation with it . I had to ( out of the blue ) reset the unit to factory defaults dozens of times . My connection would keep on getting kicked and the only way to fix it was to renew my IP address . It slowed down to a crawl and my network became useless to any sane person . I got so pissed off that I got my money back on it and bought a Buffalo Nfiniti Draft-N wireless for 20 dollars more . I am ( so far ) extremely happy with that purchase . Knock on wood . I will never buy Linksys again . Too bad I can't take back my 5 stars , cause I 'd take em all back ! I purchased this because I wanted to use a VOIP broadband phone system . Didn't want to spend a lot of money or get a piece of junk so I searched for several hours to decide to get this router . I hooked it up , rebooted my cable modem , booted the router , and then rebooted the VOIP device . My phone worked immediately and my SUSE 10.2 OS continued to download files without any restart or re-logging in . Took me about 5 minutes and it works great . Although I haven't done my three XP OS 's or my Mandriva 2007 OS yet , I feel from what I have read , Windows will be a pain in the butt . I guess I will find out when I boot into them in 2-3 months . Linksys , ViaTalk , Linux . Who would of thought something would go right for a change ..  
2	  Short and quick . Software is easy to use , but because Sony uses ATRAC , you can't play the songs on another program ( Windows etc . ) you downloaded or saved from a cd to the SONY program . But the program is very easy to use . The player itself is very small ( including the buttons ) . I purchased it strictly for the gym and long plane trips . It hold a ton of songs ( 500 + ) Why you need more that that I don't know . It also has a FM stereo receiver , so it is cool as well . In total , it is compact and easy to use . Perfect for the gym , running fanatic .  
1	  I purchased this turntable with the intent on listening to my beloved Lp 's and burning them straight to CD 's . After playing the first LP it began to drag , usually halfway through the first song on the albums . I went online and re-read the manual to see if I could make any adjustments but found nothing . So I just went back to my Marantz turntable that I bought back in 1980 and which plays fine . It has sat for two years without being played and based on some of these reviews it can be connected to the computer so I may break it out again and see if I can find some software to adjust the pitch and / or speed and just convert it to mp3 's and then to CD . The Marantz is being used to convert directly to CD now . The only reason I bought it was that I assumed that any turntable built in this decade would work better than one built in the 80 's but boy was I wrong .  
1	  I have owned this product since 2009 for use with my canon speedlights and I have begun to notice a number of the threaded screws that keep certain parts of the stand tight , simply do not work anymore . This is especially evident in the umbrella mount , I 'm guessing the thread is " shot " internally ( its plastic ) . Additionally , when folding or unfolding the stand , the springs now seem to stick and are tough to open . When everything worked properly ( brand new ) , the stand was exceptional . However , it did not take many uses to discover faults in the construction . This stand is very lightweight and I only use it indoors standing very close to my speedlight should it happen to fall over . Luckily I have never had this stand tip over on me . Overall , I 'm disappointed , but the stand is very affordable .  
1	  The durability of the Nike headphones are awful . The wires shorted out in 5 months ! Complete waste of money !  
1	  My CanoScan 8400f failed about six weeks after the warranty expired . I contacted tech support and they were very polite and prompt , but we couldn't get it to work . I took it to an authorized repair facility , but Canon doesn't repair these low-end scanners . If it 's under warranty , they replace it . If it 's past warranty , you 're stuck . They offered me a 10 % discount on a new one , but that 's more than the Amazon price with no discount . Thus , I am stuck with a big , shiny CanoScan doorstop . Bummer .  
1	  Every thing was good except one of them last only 10 months . Very disappointed . I only use themonce a week .  
1	  I purchased this item to watch some old movies of my kids . I watched ONE tape and the unit stopped working . I tried everything I could to get it to work , but could not . When I finally thought I had it fixed , I put it in the VCR and it jammed the entire machine . Had to pry it out . Don't waste your money .  
2	  We all do not like to spend tons of money on cables so when I saw this one to help link my Sonos ZP120 to a Polk Audio Subwoofer 10 I jumped on it due to the value and being a Monster Cable . It has worked perfectly and the sound is great . Always tough to tell how much of the great sound is from an item like this , but let 's put it this way-there is nothing noticeable to where I would say this particular item isn't working great . That 's all you need ! I would use this for my high end equipment as well if I needed one .  
2	  I received this in perfect condition and was a breeze to install . It didn't break like others said and I didn't expect it to once I saw it . It is a great improvement over my old one especially since my car is a 1996 model .  
2	  Was useful and needed for the new radio install . Not much to say , worked as expected . Blah blah blah blah  
2	  I bought one ( new ) for my niece for her graduation , and bought one for myself . I went to many different stores to price them , and Amazon was cheapest ! There is a site on the web that is selling this for $ 700 ! I don't know how I ever got along without it . It 's amazing and I still haven't even read the owner 's guide , so I 'm sure there is much more functionality than what I 've seen so far . Easy to use !  
2	  I use this gps holder on my mountain bike and it supports very well all kind of abuse , hits on the ground , vibrations , etc . Very well made product with a strong plastic and a hard fix to the bike .  
2	  Needed a small camer to take on vacations . Great camera for the price . 6X optical lens plus image stabilizer is a big plus not found on similiarly priced cameras . Only complaint is there is no optical viewfinder and in bright situations render it impossible to see .  
1	  .. badly flawed , I 'm afraid . Nice display and heft . But : Direct USB connection freezes my Macs ( PowerBook 12 , and iMac 2008 ) . My PC with XP ( both sp2 & sp3 ) sees an " unknown device " and finds no driver . And , slideshow quits after maybe 100 photos , including many skips , although my card had 600 + photos . No quantity limit is specified in the booklet or advertisement . Tried loading the card from PC instead of Mac , but show still quits early . Tried breaking the show into multiple folders with sequential names ; then it seemed to run longer , but skipped folders too . Should accept various preloaded memory cards . But , 1GB Patriot brand SD card initially didn't seem to work in it ( but was OK in the PC ) ; a 256 MB CF card worked in it , but slideshow still terminates early . Also the buttons are hidden , hard to distinguish . Amazon kindly exchanged the first one for a like unit ; I hoped it might work better , but no go . Coby would require shipping to NY state on the customer 's dollar both ways . Breaking News - Coby tech support was polite , but did not have any answers . The Coby manual says " baseline JPEG files up to 32 million pixels and 14MB in size " , but that apparently is untrue . After multiple experiments , I discovered success ONLY after using Windows XP 's ( right-click in Explorer ) " resize pictures " function ( to 800x600 , replace ) on the contents of photo folders while on the PC . Then , load all photos at once onto a freshly formatted memory card ( to avoid fragmentation , which seems to change the play order ) in a card reader . With this effort , all photos ( in sequential folders ) seemed to play correctly . Turns out , folders are not necessary for my 630 pictures . COBY needs to tell it 's customers of this resizing requirement , and also not to connect their Mac directly lest it latch up ; and to provide PC drivers .  
1	  This thing is horrible , and I am returning mine tomorrow . Picture quality is absolutely pathetic . I 've seen better pictures from camera-phones . In bright light , with no motion , with everyone holding their breath , you may be able to get an acceptably sharp picture . At any other time forget it . With decreasing light and increasing amounts of motion , picture quality degrades to a featureless blur of colors . I checked , double-checked , and re-checked to make sure that I wasn't missing something obvious ( I wasn't ) . In addition to this overarching complaint , I have to say that the camera body is flimsy , and feels cheap . Unlike the solid metal you find on , say , a Canon Powershot , this one is plastic . The cover for the battery station is made of the same cheap plastic , and feels as if it could break off after a moderate amount of use . This is exacerbated by the fact that it takes 4 AA batteries which must be removed for replacement or recharging . Battery life with standard Alkaline batteries was abysmal - after 20 shots the " check battery " indicator was already flashing . I never got around to checking the bundled software . After 1 bungled gymnastics meet it was clear that this was not the camera for me . The preview LCD is very large , sharp , and clear . In fact , pictures look better on it than they do at full size . Printed documentation is minimal . To learn about all of the settings , you must consult the soft-copy " Advanced " guide on the included CD .  
2	  Solid and well built case . I use this case for storing high end folding knives . Very pleased with the product 's fit and finish . Case can be locked up and secured to keep away from and protect children as well as anti theft purposes . So far , so good .  
2	  Works exactly as advertised . The battery-based system is MUCH more convenient than most of the other designs I saw . Definitely the best extender on Amazon .  
1	  Believe the reviews here , this thing doesn't work .  
2	  The case itself is well made . It has enough padding without making the case look bulky . My P200 fits perfect . The external mesh pocket fits a spare battery and a memory stick . The case comes with a long strap that is meant to be attached directly to the camera . I already have the shorter strap that came with the camera attached to it . I thought this longer strap could be attached to the hook so I can wear the camera case on my neck or shoulder . The hook is meant to be attached only to a rucksack or bag , not the long strap . The velcro is secure enough to keep the camera inside if you wanted to hold the camera by the strap . Overall , I would recommend this case . I gave it only 4 stars because I had no use for the long strap .  
2	  This is a very good product . Nice sound and good noise reduction . Although it will not remove crying babies and loud people , it does a nice job of removing back ground noise . Good not great bass response but a nice well balanced sound . I would definitely recommend them .  
2	  Good mouse to use . I travel a lot for work and use this everyday . I tend to be a bit clumsy , so I have dropped it quite a bit , but it kept working and working . After 2 years and 8 months of this , it was time to get a new one though . But it is a great mouse to use . Heck , it was the mouse that I bought to replace my old one .  
1	  The mechanics of this mouse was ok , the exterior sides , however became sticky almost like it had a gooey melting rubbery material flaw .  
2	  This mouse is just the right size for traveling and for everyday use . I 'm still learning to use all the features and have enjoyed being able to zoom , switch between screens , and search , all from the mouse . I wouldn't recommend it for children until they get some control and understanding of how a mouse works and when they are able to understand the funtions of the various buttons . It 's been a joy to use and I recommend it highly .  
1	  I bought this camera specifically because of it 's advertised " Water Resistence " . Recently , my camera was splashed , wiped dry and put into an encloseded bag . Condensation formed on the inside of the camera causing it to malfunction . I sent it to olympus who would not honor the warranty and charged me $ 186.00 to repair my camera which they advertise as all weather and water resistent . Beyond that their customer service manager , Vince was rude and sarcastic over the phone and made several degrading remarks during my call with him . I am elevating this up the Olympus management chain but I think people should know that this camera does not perform as advertised .  
2	  Being a long time Nikon user , it seemed only natural to " stay in the family so to speak " when purchasing a DSLR . I decided to look into Canons after hearing so many rave reviews , and to make sure I was getting the best camera for my money . The Canon Digital Rebel Series of cameras felt small and toy like in my hands . The Nikon D50 felt well , like a Nikon . Larger , heavier , more durable and like an old friend . I found the controls and program modes extremely user friendly . This is coming from someone who has used Nikon FM and FM2 35mm cameras ( these cameras are fully manual and can even work without batteries ) for over two decades . The D50 metering system is simply superb in all modes . I was a bit disappointed that there is not a depth of field preview button on the camera . This concern was quickly dispelled by the very bright screen on the back of the camera . Another plus , especially for old Nikon users like my self , is that most all Nikon lenses from the past can be used on this camera . My first photos shot using the D50 were so sharp , they looked like prints made from Kodachrome in my old cameras . From beginner to seasoned photographers , the Nikon D50 is a superb choice .  
2	  Worked perfectly with Win7 64bit right out of the box . No need to update drivers or hunt drivers like I have seen many people say is needed with certain Bluetooth adapters . Getting it setup with my Palm Centro was a little confusing at first , but that was Palms fault , not the adapters ( on screen instructions on the Palm were a little screwy ) . Finally just decided to keep hitting next on the phone till the end of setup and see what happens , and to my surprise it worked flawlessly . I was really impressed with the speed of the Hotsync , it seems to be about the same speed as the USB cable was before I got this new computer . This phone is the only Bluetooth device I currently have , so I have no way to test it with other devices . But I 'm impressed either way since I took a flyer on this .. I must have posted on 10 different websites asking for info on Win 7 64bit compatible adapters , and nobody ever responded to me , and Microsoft compatibility website was no help at all . I am really happy I got it right on the first try without having to test out a bunch of different adapters to find one that worked .  
1	  this is a pretty nifty clock . Nothing to bad here - just DO NOT count on the projection - it is VERY diffieculy to see .  
2	  I purchased the Phillips DVD-963SA after the advent of SACD . This was one of the first affordable machines available . Through Amazon , it was here in days . I was pleasantly surprised with the audio qualities of the normal 2 channel CD format . It 's the best sounding machine I 've owned or heard , for that matter . I found someone Online that offers modifications to further ' improves ' these units , so I was about to send it off to him , when it stopped functioning , period . It won't turn on or off or do anything . This is the second Phillips product , the other being a TV , that did exactly the same thing . I don't know what to say , except I 'll weigh this information when I consider any future Phillip 's purchases . Great sound but poor quality construction ?  
2	  Worked great - Wish I had bought it sooner . - Be very careful about adding additional memory . The bad new is the Memory stick I bought was slightly off sized so I filed it to fit into the memory slot now the printer is dead and this was a waste of money as I had to buy a new printer .  
1	  I concur with the previous reviewer 's points that the device 's weight and ports arrangement make the hub seem cheap and limit it 's usage . I 'll add that Belkin has misleading advertising for the product and that I recieved rather poor customer service from them . First off , the hub functioned , but not until I plugged the AC adapter in . I have a basic MS optical mouse , a Lexus Jump Drive , a digital camera and an SD card reader . None of them work with the hub unplugged . I 'm 0 for 4 , even though ' most devices work without power supply ' .. Second , after I plugged the hub into one of my rear USB ports , the other went dead . Since I 've decided I didn't want to use this piece of junk , I 've been unable to plug any of the other devices directly into either of my PC USB ports anymore . These other devices work when going through the powered hub ( or the new drive bay ports ) , but not otherwise . I emailed Belkin and they responded by telling me to call the helpline . After 10-15 minutes on hold , the CSR had me plugging and unplugging things for another 15 minutes until he drew the conclusion that " our device is working properly , contact your PC manufaturer to find out what 's wrong with the PC " . A half hour on the phone to determine the problem was what I originally described in my email .. I have no idea if the technical fault is with the hub or the motherboard , but I 've used the USB ports for over 2 years without a hint of trouble until I plugged the TetraHub into them . BTW , I eventually found a drive-bay hub that plugged directly into the motherboard and suited my needs perfectly for half the price . I 'm not sure what could make the TetraHub worth the price , even if it didn't have problems , unless you have some affinity to pretty lights ..  
1	  these headphones were great at first , but then failed ( right ear stopped working ) after 3 months . I sent the orginal pair back to the manufacturer for a replacement , but the replacement pair also failed with the same problem after a couple more months . Stay away from these .  
2	  Alright , here 's the deal . I purchased these speakers about 2 months ago , and though I would check out Amazon to see what other people thought . To my surprize , 3 out of 3 don't like them . I think they ROCK ! Maybe if you 're listening to Tchaikovsky or Beathoven , they don't hit the high notes as well as some .. speakers , but for cranking up Metallica , AC / DC , Alice in Chains , or anything else written after 1960 , THESE THINGS ROCK THE HOUSE ! Just check out those woofers . You really can't go wrong ! I 'm out !  
1	  Two stars because they fit my printer and because they had some ink in them . I bought these as a low cost replacement to Canon 's outrageously priced ink cartridges . These fit exactly as you would expect , but the printer indicated they were both empty and so required me to bypass the error generated by the printer for empty cartridges . Additionally , the cartridges only lasted a few pages before running out of ink . Don't waste your money .  
2	  The cord length and clip are perfect . The Headset fits perfectly and is easy to put on . The sponge for the ear piece is a bit large and rough . The volume is fine and the sound is crystal clear .  
1	  The unit powers up but the drive never spins up . I assume that either the drive is defective or the controller card . Online help is useless . I called SimpleTech support and no one answers .. their " after hours " message says that they are open from 6:30 AM but they are still not open for calls 2 hours later . Maybe their clocks are also broken ? Interestingly the sales department also does not answer even 1 hour after their business hours begin ( after 7:30 AM ) . Don't buy this - they have no support at all .  
2	  Great product - I have both frequencies for this product family . Check out my review of this system using the 418 mhz . frequency . - I can't recommend this product more highly .  
1	  I like the small size of these speakers , but the designers weighted the sound too heavy in the lower-midrange and bass . The result is somewhat muddy . I would love to know of a similarly-sized speaker with better balanced performance .  
2	  In response to previous reviewers comments stating " Does it really matter ? " , since I am an electrial engineer , here is my situation : I have an older ThinkPad laptop that IBM says only supports up to 1280x1024 DVI output because higher resolutions have bad digital video noise due to a weak TDMS transmitter . Thus , after doing my research , I realized I needed the lowest loss , shortest DVI cable I could find in order to drive my new Dell 24 " 1920x1200 flat panel . This cable performed better than I ever thought it could . I was able to drive my 24 " monitor without any digital noise , when IBM and other users had stated it was impossible . I didn't even need to used the reduce DVI bandwidth options . In short , for most users , this cable is a complete waste of money . In fact , the claim on the box that a bad DVI cable can cause dull colors and a blurred image is a flat out lie . However , if you need a high quality cable for a special situation like this , go with the 1 meter long DVI400 !  
2	  I love this remote ! It 's very small and light , can attach directly to your neckstrap so it is always handy , and is very easy to use . I am by no means an expert , but an avid " hobby " photographer and do lots of family shots , and this is a perfect addition to my gear . Great value for the price .  
2	  Great product that is easy to use . I bought one for my husband to use during work and he liked it so much that he bought me one too ! 5 star product !  
1	  Western Digital WDXMS1200TN Passport 120 GB USB 2.0 2.5-Inch Portable Hard DriveWe had this product for 6 months and it suddenly stopped working with no warning . I lost my entire backup data . The product came with a limited 4 months warranty . Outside the warranty Western Digital require $ 14 / - for technical support per incident , but no assurance of recovering the data . So baisically we have to discard this .  
2	  i purchased this card for my olympis camera and have found it to be satisfactory and works just fine for the price . It 's hard to find these cards for older camera 's when technology has changed so . It was great to find this on amazon . I have had a couple times where I reformated the card and it didn't work and said no card found but once taking out and reinserting in the camera this solved the problem . This has only happened a couple times though so overall I am pleased . samsung ALWAYS has good products .  
2	  Wow ! I 'm impressed . This little gadget is economical , not cheap . A friend bought one on my recommendation and says the performance using the analog audio input jack is marginal . He and I agree , however , that the performance using a thumb drive or an SD card is terrific ! I 've just ordered six more , some for gift giving and a couple that I will use inside my house - after I buy the parts and build the 12 Volt adapters ( later today ) . Note that I strongly prefer the SD card for media . The card fits within the physical profile of the device whereas a thumb drive protrudes and might get bumped , resulting in damage to the drive and / or the player .  
2	  Let me just start out by saying that this system is a fantastic value for the money . If you 're on a budget , want to get good quality surround sound , and have an average size room this product is for you . Most of the reviews I 've seen here on Amazon are pretty spot on so I won't bother repeating them . I get the impression though that this system is largely targeted at people who are new to home theater , like me . Here are some things I picked up along the way that I wish I would have known when I first set up the system . Just to be clear , I actually purchased two of these units , one for my living room and one for my family room . They are set up slightly differently . 1 . ) The speaker wire they provide you probably won't be nearly enough . I initially made the mistake of purchasing a really thick gauge of wire , which made setup cumbersome . In my experience 22 gauge speaker wire is perfect for the system . 2 . ) The best sound you are going to get will come through the digital inputs into the unit . Check the back of your DVD Player / Cable Box / Game Console / Whatever and look for either a digital optical output or a coaxial digital output . Make sure you use those ( even if the cords are $ 40 ) . 3 . ) This one took me 6 months to figure out .. Just because your device is hooked up to the receiver with one of the digital connections , it may not be actually using it . On my DVD player I connected the Red / White RCA cables along with the coaxial cable . The system never sounded right . One day I fiddled with the DVD player options and surprise ! The option for digital output was turned off . I turned it on and everything started sounding awesome . 4 . ) The digital optical input only works when you set the receiver on SA-CD . I don't know why .. There are many devices other than SA-CD players that use digital optical out . You still get true Dolby Digital Surround Sound though so it doesn't really matter . This is just one of things that Sony did that makes no sense to me . 5 . ) If you do get a digital optical cord , know that there are clear plastic caps on each of the ends that need removed . Don't spend an hour trying to jam the cord into you system like I did .. 6 . ) The " Universal " remote that comes with the system is only " Universal " with other Sony products . That 's ok , you 'll be buying a Harmony remote eventually anyway , you just don't know it yet ;-) You 're going to REALLY enjoy this system . In closing , I really would suggest reading the instruction manual on this one . I know that sounds like a lame piece of advice but if you 're new to this stuff it really is invaluable . If you 're on a shoestring budget you won't be disappointed with this home theater in a box !  
1	  Buttons are tiny and unreadable . Cost was high . Most DVD 's skip and freeze if newer ( more dense ) . SONY should have recalled this and fix it for free , but charges $ 114 to fix it ( and you have to mail it to them unless you live really close to a repair station ) . NO MORE SONY PRODUCTS FOR US .  
1	  I would not purchase this printer again . If this printer were about 75 bucks .. I would purchase it again . I am evaluating this on a cost per year basis . I have had it for a little over 4 years and it has been used for light to moderate home use . Its good point : Pretty economical ink usage ( for a home use ) . Its bad points : About two years after we got this printer it started making this horrible " machine gun " clicking sound . It did not appear to hinder its ability to work - its just extremely loud and goes on for 15 - 45 seconds at a time . After about 3 years it started putting black streaks on the back-side of every document . We would clean the heads and that would work for a WHILE . After a while - this cleaning procedure no longer worked . No wifi . This printer has a lot of great features - but that doesn't really matter if it doesn't work properly for more than a few years at this price ( 499 usd ) .  
1	  For the 3rd time just a slight jarring has killed my D50 . Never even got to run a full discharge of this battery . The D50 is one weak camera killed by a bump against a hand-rail . Will never buy Nikon digital again !  
2	  I liked the layout of the remote and bright screen , but had trouble setting it up with Logitech / Harmony web site .  
1	  This clock radio is actually a " Dream Machine " but it does not say that in the description . Dream Machine sounds very impressive but I think it is just something that was dreamed up by their marketing department . The reason that I bought this alarm clock was that it is advertized as having dual alarms . But you don't get two radio alarms you get a radio alarm and a buzzer alarm . I don't really like to be wakened to a buzzer and I use my clock radio to remind me about certain things going on around the house and I usually like just a radio to come on when that happens . And a lot of times I like to time more than one event at a time . So this radio is not as useful to me as it could be . A lot of the General Electric Clock Radios have dual alarms and for each one of the two you can choose if you want that alarm to be radio or buzzer . The time set feature is very good with a fast plus , a fast minus , and a slow plus . This is important because with some clock radios you can spend a lot of time setting the alarm time .  
2	  I have a 64Mb MMC which is fine . Fits a nice hour ( approx ) of 128Khz MP3 . The Panasonic site states that a 256Mb card will be available , well , now ! Has anyone seen or heard of this , as I haven't . 256Mb would be great - can't wait ..  
1	  I upgraded my home net with several pieces of Netgear hardware , including the FR114P router , the WG102 Wifi Access Point , and the FS108P , an 8-port switch with 4 Power Over Ethernet ( POE ) ports . The AP and the POE switch have been excellent choices . Not so with the router . Although it has features you don't find in a lot of consumer routers , like stateful packet inspection ( SPI ) , logging , and email alerts , it just kept dropping connections to my home PCs for no apparent reason that I could find , and no support from Netgear . The DHCP server would seem to die , and all my home PCs would then lose their IPs and revert to private IPs ( 169.254 . x . x ) . At that point my only recourse was to restart the router . After three weeks of this nonsense , I said to he * with it . I 'm sending it back . The router I 'm interested in now is the SMC Barricade Plus SMCBR14VPN .  
1	  I was worried when I read many comments that it is not ATHANC7 but ATHANC7b which is cheaper than ATHANC7 . But I believed the used one would be ATHANC7 , and I ordered from amazon warehouse , and I just realized I was wrong . Well , I guess there is no ATHANC7 here . And apparently ATHANC7b is not as good as ATHANC7 . So I just returned it , and reordered Bose QuiteCompfort15 .  
2	  This cable has served me well for 2 years now , and with a silver core , O2 free copper , double shielding , machined ends , 24K gold plated ends , silver soldered , etc . , what more could you want in a component video cable in this price range ? It 's a far better value than M _ _ $ _ _ R.  
1	  I put it in my camera and didnt work , i had to buy a new one at k-mart , it was a 2 gig and it worked . So the problem wasnt my camera .  
2	  EXACTLY what I was NEEDED ! This is no toy ! There seems to be some negativecomments due to the Lag-Time between the time that you turn on the recorder , and when it opens the tray : - Patience , Grasshopper ! - this machine does somuch more ! IT 'S A COMPUTER ! Allow it to go through it 's boot-up process , after which theresponses are just as fast as any other DVD Player It 's a tool , you need to readthe manual throughly but once you understand the concept , it 's very simple . AT LAST ! I can transfer my MASSIVE VHS Library ! Unfortunately some had al-ready begun to degrade . BACK & FORTH ! Far Out ! VHS to DVD & Vice Versa ! Aside from the ability to handle the newest blank media ( includ . RAM & DOUBLESIDED Disks ) the best part is being able to record off my TV ! It 's every bit as easyto record multiple 5 minute segments of a newsreel , or a 6 hour congressionalmeeting at the touch of a button as it had been on my old VCR . TV , VCR , Now DVD-R <- All TOSHIBA ! ;) I just keep coming back !  
2	  im an avid fan of mac . i see how mac has evolved from simple , single-unit computers to a techy , all-in-one , super loaded one . i actually owned the classic one , which was later replaced by performa 580 and then upgraded to a new imac , in a dalmatian blue flavor . everything is great in this computer ; speed speaks for it . true , when they said that mac is the fastest way to get you to the internet . right out of the box , all i need are simple configurations of my isp , hook up the tel line , and tada , im now online . i tunes is really a cool stuff ; im able to rip all my cds . im also able to burn cds as well , though my cd broke just after weeks of using it . i haven't used the imovies yet , coz i dont own a digi video cam . the downsides of this machine are as follows - 1 excessive heat buildup , which seems to be quite normal for every apple masterpiece . i wonder if apple 's gonna be introducing a frying pan on their next-generation computers . 2 frequent freezing of the os ; the mac always hangs by itself , but within the next half minute or so , it goes running again . 3 incompatibility issues with pc standards . i tried using virtual pc , but i encountered some problems with the software , and i account connectix for that . also , techy people should also be aware of the compatibility of their gadgets with the mac / pc . like for instance , my digi cam ( hp c215 ) is not compatible with mac . so i guess it will be stucked up with my pc for the rest of my life . 4 absence of floppy disk drive outdates my mac . though cd writer and internet connection is a good alternative for data transfer , floppy disks are still reliable and more convenient way for such purpose . extra cost for buying external one is hefty . well i guess apple did a good wit this imac . i just hope that the next generation of their machines would be completely perfect . by the way , where the g4 cube has gone ?  
2	  This is another aid to help get a great picture , I 'm starting to shake a lot in my elder years and it sure helps to have this item .  
2	  The Nintendo DS charger does essentially what it was made for : to charge your Nintendo DS Lite . I bought this real quick since I couldn't for the life of mine find my old charger , and two bucks was a great deal , honestly . Package arrived two days later , and , ba-zam , it charged the damn Nintendo DS , like it promised .  
2	  It is practical ( ready to use in any event , no hassle of setting ) Photo good enough for keepsake as well as sharing ,  
2	  It pleases my heart to see toys like the Fur Real Friends appear on the market . As an avid animal lover , I operate my own kitty rescue shelter in northwest Ohio . I have always recognized the importance of children learning gentleness and kindness with animals . I believe that toys like Fur Real Friends can help teach children the precious human virtue of kindness toward all living things . At this time I can only fairly rate this toy on its educational merit , because I do not own one , yet . However , I do hope they will be available for purchase soon !  
2	  This is the lightest most appropriate USB mouse for a laptop . Therefore , when the first one developed a crack in the cable , I immediately replaced it with a new one . I have wound the part of the cable near the mouse with electrical tape in hopes that this will prevent the kind of breaking which my first one suffered . Unfortunately , those selling this product have by now figured out that there is nothing else on the market which is just like this one . Therefore , the price has gone up from $ 11 . to almost $ 30 . I therefore recommend winding electrical tape around the first inch of the cable from the get-go so you won't have to buy this product twice .  
2	  I 've had this TV for a month now , and am impressed with its picture , style , and the number and type of connections on the back of the TV . It is a " Best Buy " in my book , plus March 2007 Consumers Reports gave the Olevia a pretty good review . There are two annoyances that leave it short of five stars : ( 1 ) the TV is not able to be controlled by my Comcast-provided remote , and the Olevia remote can't be programmed to control all the features of the cable box - therefore I have to use two remotes ; ( 2 ) there is a piercing blue light that emits from the on / off switch when the TV is turned off , so if you have this TV in the bedroom , you 'll have to put a little piece of black electrical tape over the light because it is so uncomfortably bright .  
2	  This is the second set of these speakers I have purchased . These ones are going to be a gift . I 've searched around for travel speakers and these guys are the best buy around : for under $ 20 you get 10 watts of power , adjustable bass and treble that actually works , and a very decent amount of sound . If you 're looking for speakers that stay at home , the JBL Creatures are another good buy at about $ 83 .  
2	  The router was easy to set up , and worked well ; however , it was susceptible to interference and I needed to move it several times until I found a location that did not cause that problem .  
1	  The poor dear gets flustered whenever I ask it to do something complicated , like print more than one page . It also sometimes forgets that it should print the whole page , not just the top half . It has no problem rapidly consuming ink , though . Will it make it to graduation day ? Doubtful . ( See " Office Space . " )  
2	  Works as stated . BEWARE .. on my macbook pro , I need to support the connector in some way ( underneath ) . ONLY FOR USE WHEN LAPTOP IS ON FLAT SURFACE . Between the weight of the FW400 cable and the connector itself , it tends to sag down and can interrupt connection to your device , or damage the FW800 input or adaptor or both . There 's really nothing that can be done about this aside from SONNET making a FW800 to FW400 cable . My audio interface highly suggested using this brand of adapter , so my options were limited . To my knowledge , SONNET does not make a cable - only the adapter . That being said , it 's a minor inconvenience , but just slap something underneath there to support it , and call it a day .  
1	  I agree with Shelly . This camera takes great pictures BUT worked properly for about a month . I sent it back to kodak and they repaired some things and it 's malfunctioning again ! It is no longer under warranty so I might as well by a new one . It goes off and on by itself , the lens pops out , then back in , its ridiculous . They said for me to use lithium batteries , so that I did , and they do last forever it seems ( much longer than rechargable ) but its still acting up . I thought I would 've gotten a much better camera from kodak . Going to try a different brand next .  
1	  You have got to be kidding . Do not try this on a USB3 drive . It will not work . Cannot believe that Avanquest does not trumpet this non-capability on their site . Sure it is in the small print , BUT the market has moved to USB3.0 The interface is fine for me , but I need the 3.0 capability .  
2	  I 've owned a Harmony 680 remote for over 5 years . It has been failing for the last 2 years , but was more or less usable until recently . The 670 is good replacement - not exactly the same though . The feel of the buttons is different , less rubbery and harder . Some of the buttons are in different places too , but you can always remap them to whatever you like . Comparing the 670 to the One and 700 , there seems to be no reason at all to spend an extra $ 100 for the ridiculous touch screen or color display . I control 5 devices with this remote , and I only use the display buttons in very rare situations , i.e. to adjust settings on my cable box or change surround sound mode .  
2	  This card may not be the most high end , but it still is the absolute best when it comes to studio quality for personal use ! What I REALLY love about this card is that Linux Mint or Ubuntu will automatically detect it and install open source drivers for it for you ! So its really quick to install and gives VERY good quality sound ! The only downside is for Windows , you HAVE to install the drivers by hand . Otherwise Windows will just give it a generic sound device driver and it will NOT give you the sound you want .  
2	  The speakers work even better than I expected the sound is clear and crisp and the experience is great .  
2	  Good and courteus service , great product , great company and nice people to do business with . I find these Mio 's GPS 's better than any other . Sure would buy again if needed .  
2	  There is little I can say . I recived it quickly in 2 days of ordering it . I am very happy with my magnifier . It is not Glass , and I wish it had a sleeve to keep it from getting any stray dust on it . However I just use a soft glass cloth that came with my Camera , and so it 's also easy to keep clean . The handle was a little light , so it is not heavy duty . Overall however it was a good buy , I can read again now .  
1	  The Nanotune is awesome and I loved that I could take it everywhere , but it died after the second week of having it . I have exchanged it once before since it died a week after , now it died again . I wish I can find the manual to get my money back . It won't last if you buy it . Get some thing that holds it in place . The velcro that came with it slipped right off and it kept falling all over my car when I slowly went over a speed bump . Do not buy !  
2	  Nice product . Great value of money . Good for travel , casual use like bird / animal watching . at $ 24 , it cannot be better . It is compact and weighs so little .  
1	  I bought my optical mouse about a year ago . I was very happy with my puchase back then , but as I began to use the mouse I started to notice one glaring problem . The clip used to secure the wireless conector to the back of the mouse ( thus shutting off the battery ) just doesn't hold tight enough anymore . Therefor it leaves the battery on and the batteries lasts about a week before your replacing them again . Perhaps Microsoft needs to work out a few kinks .  
1	  I never put on headphones that were so uncomfortable . I would recommend them to my worst enemy but probably no one else should buy the until they redesign them .  
2	  This cable was the perfect length and excellent quality . It was also easy to hide under the capret since it was going from one room to another . Great buy !  
2	  Works great with my 58 " Panasonic plasma and Denon receiver . Before I installed this I had trouble with the remote not working well since the components are inside a cabinet with glass doors . I tried other extenders but the infrared from the plasma rendered them useless . I mounted the sensor behind the top edge of the TV and tilted it down to minimize the pickup of reflected IR from the TV . I stuck the LED indicated behind my center channel speaker grill and I can still see it flash without is being distracting . The black box I mounted inside my cabinet with Velcro . The unit is working well , but sometimes in a totally dark room it can still pickup some IR from the TV and not work quite perfectly . The adjustment of the sensor is very critical . I would like also like to see the emitter cables be detachable for easier routing . Overall this works exactly as advertised .  
2	  Ive never had one issue with Western digital caviar drives , and I used them the last 10 or more years , since I never shut my machiens off they rn 24/7 and the WD caviar drives just run perfectly . I bought 2 of these caviar blue drives , now a 3rd one , the first 2 came in a nice little box with instruction manual not a little piece of paper , and mounting screws , it was well packaged and it just looked great , you definitely felt and could see its a quality drive .  
1	  I have 2 digital cameras , a new Kodak Z612 and a Casio EXILIM about a year old . Neither camera recognizes this card . I tried formatting it and the cameras still do not recognize the card . The 3D website does not even show the card . Tiger Direct will not accept it as a return . 2 lessons : don't buy this card and don't buy anything Amazon sells of Tiger Direct .  
2	  I used to have a belkin tunecast II , it was good ; my brother has an itrip .. it 's ok ; but this transmitter is extremely good , perfect quality I never get static , it 's a hundred times better than anything I 've tried before . Easy to use . I love it . i'ts worth it .  
2	  Let me say right off the bat that this is a positive review and I love these headphones . That is not however going to stop me from pointing out foibles and peculiarities that are unique to the ATH-EW9 's . I have had and listened to these phones every day for the last two weeks through my iPod Touch 32GB G1 primarily , and a few other devices just for curiosity sake . I am in the audio field professionally , and I am a recovering audiophile ( I try to not read the mags and stay out of the shops ! ) and have had way to much high end gear in the past ; still trying to cut back ! So how did I come across these Japanese Cherry Wood beauties ? An online product 's of the year page on Yahoo had the ATH-EW7 's listed as an excellent pair of phones , and the link to the Audio Technica page led me to the EW9 's that I bought sight unseen or heard . Not that I didn't do a Froogle search for a good price from a good seller ( $ 142.90 Amazon ) and a Goggle search so that I would know whether I had the genuine article , not the pervasive Chinese knockoff 's . Right out of the box I listened to 21 iTunes downloads of 60 's , 70 's and 80 's pop tunes that I like for their musical value primarily and recording quality secondarily and my first impression was not good . Any good headphones need breaking in and these AT 's are no exception . They sounded somewhat better on my purist recording tracks but not much ; they needed time to loosen up . They did , and sooner that I thought they would . Next days listening had much less of that compressed digital edge I heard on day one , and the sound has steadily improved to where I am happy listening to all but the worst recordings with them . So the sound has reached the point where I can recommend them to all but the most bass heavy Rap listeners ; these ain't phat bass phones ; more like analytical ear monitors . The way they look : unlike anything else ; just the coolest , best looking product of it 's kind that I have run across . Ergonomics : very light yet extremely well made , and no band across or behind the head which I like cause I like to wear a baseball cap fairly often when I go for a walk or other casual excursions . This brings me to the biggest drawback for me ; hair . I 've got a lot of it that I usually wear pulled back in a ponytail , so putting on and taking off the ear bands that hold the phones to the ear is usually an exercise in hair pulling and tangling . Not an issues for most guys who wear their hair short on the sides , but ladies be forewarned . Issue # 2- The cable , while very pliable and of good quality it requires a bit of care when placing the phones in the nice little padded soft case that AT supplies . It is also a very short lead that terminates into a very nice high grade miniphone jack . The 1-meter extension ( also supplied ) is somewhat disappointing by comparison . This leads me to my request to Audio Technica : come up with some type of cable management system , these headphones are of high sound and esthetic quality and deserve something better . Care and handling : These are not throw em ' in the gym bag or purse phones . As I said , they are well made and finished , but do require considerably more care than the white ear buds that come with every iPod . But that 's also part of the draw of these headphones . Much is made about the housings that are made of Hokkaido Asada Cherry Wood , and the chocolate brown box they come in indicates this no less than three times . The Cherry Blossom is an important symbol in Japanese culture , and the tree from which they grow no doubt holds similar reverence if these headphones are any indicator . They demand to be treated with respect and reverence . So after providing hours of listening pleasure I carefully remove them from my head , and polish the Hokkaido Asada Cherry Wood housings with a shoe mitt with a sprits of Pledge to bring out the luster on the wood grain . I then carefully wind the cables and tuck each phone into it 's respective pocket and zip up the case until I listen to them again . I did say I was a recovering audiophile , seems I still have a way to go !  
2	  Great product . The big CON is the Garmin policies about their databases and their _ very _ poor support . I bought a microSD City Navigator and I can't register it ( the site doesn't allow it ) and I can't backup it ( copying the files doesn't work ) . The Garmin support gave me at least 10 different answers about this but no solution for the problem . If I lose the chip or it gets damaged ( as happened a few months ago with another chip ) I will have nothing . Also _ very _ bad is the fact that you can not update any info in the card . And there are many small errors ( things are constantly changing ! ) . - The compass and altimeter have to be calibrated to be reliable . - The unit is not water proof and doesn't floatIf you 're not considering using Garmin maps / cityNavigators , it 's a very good choice . If you need Garmin 's maps / cityNavigators , prepare youself to be frustated with very bad support and many small errors that you can not fix .  
2	  My wife and I really wanted to get a super-zoom once our baby became mobile . Unfortunately my old Canon Elph died and forced us to buy something right now . Neither of us are even close to amateur photographers , but we 've had excellent results with this camera . I was a little intimidated by the complexity , but the menu 's are well layed out and the equipment seems to compensate for my lack of skill . The only minor complaint I have is that the controls a bit plasticy ( is that a word ? ) We 'll see how it holds up

1	  First of all , this computer bag is ENORMOUS ! I could have used it for a weekend bag . Far too big for anything I 'll need . Second , the vendor charged by $ 21 for shipping . So beware , what they lose on the cheaper price , they make up on shipping - don't be fooled . Third , return process was such a hassle , it was almost cheaper for me just to keep this beast and use it as luggage rather than for work . Buyer beware .  
2	  This is a good product , but inicially is complicated insert photos , because it does not come with installation software , so , you have to download it on the coby home page . After that , it woarks very well , but sometimes computer does not recognize it , just insert usb cable sometimes and it will work fine . CONS : should have more memory  
1	  I have had a completely disappointing experience with this machine and with the company that produces it . It is not compatible with my Sampo or Samsung DVD players . I believe this machine will become the equivalent of the notorious Beatmax . Luckily , I can afford to throw away .. but how many people can ?  
1	  This is my first blue ray player . I wanted to be able to use netflix , so thought this unit would be perfect . i bought this in January , used once , then left town for 3 months . Came back late April , used it maybe 3 more times , then it went dead . Won't even turn on . I talked to Samsung and they said it needed to be sent to repair , but much to my surprise , the warranty only covers 3 months of labor at a service center an hour away . So it would cost me more to fix this than it 's worth . I had this unit on a surge protector outlet , and the cable box and tv also plugged into that outlet work fine , so it wasn't an electricity problem . A unit that plays less than 10 times before dying is just unacceptable . Very disappointed in Samsung .  
2	  I have a Speck cover for my macbook , and sticking it into this sleeve is a bit tight but I think after time , the case will stretch out . It 's very well padded . Nice looking . Maintains it shape ( I 've had it for 4 months so far ) . Case looks great , not boring like the traditional black neoprene cases .  
2	  Last year , after extensive research , I bought a Canon A540 to replace my trusty Olympus D40-Zoom . My goals for camera selection where ( a ) compact size , ( b ) standard AA batteries , ( c ) full manual controls , ( d ) outstanding image quality , ( e ) speed , ( f ) optical viewfinder . The A540 fit the bill almost perfectly , with a handful of limitations that I noted in my review . This year , with Canon 's release of the A570IS , I decided to upgrade , driven by the addition of optical image stabilization ( IS ) . While the IS is impressive , I was surprised by other improvements that Canon has made . Image noise levels are significantly lower and more controlled for higher ISO captures . The Digic II processor seems to make more intelligent decisions about lighting and flash exposure , especially when its face recognition is engaged . Add a dramatically better quality LCD screen , slightly higher 7.1MP resolution , improved case , and support of high capacity SD cards , and I doubt I 'll need to upgrade any time soon . Like the A540 , the A570IS is for me a perfect balance of size , speed , and photo quality . The A570IS is the same physical size as the A540 . It 's small enough to fit in a coat pocket or small belt case yet uses 2 AA batteries . Like the A540 , overall processing speed is very fast unless you 're taking flash pictures ( and then you should expect about 4-6 seconds between flashes depending on battery level and what flash strength the camera selected ) . Note that flash time is significantly better with high-capacity rechargeable NiMh batteries than with standard AAs . And , unlike some other cameras I have tried , the speed of the user interface ( especially during playback ) is very fast . Picture quality in general is excellent , even in low light situations . Noise at higher ISO is significantly more controlled than the A540 , perhaps a benefit of the new 7.1MP CCD and the Digic II image processor . According to the documentation , noise reduction is applied at slow shutter speeds of 1.3 seconds or greater , and this can slightly slow down shot-to-shot time . There is no option to disable or adjust the noise processing , but in my experience the results are very good . When noise reduction is applied , there is a slight loss of detail compared to the A540 , but the results are noticeably better on the A570IS with its built-in noise reduction than post-processing noise on pictures taken with the A540 . In my own head-to-head comparisons between the A570IS and A540 , the A570IS has better light metering and noticeably sharper detail on indoor shots without a flash ( especially when image stabilization is engaged ) . The A570IS does favor slightly higher ISO in auto modes than the A540 , giving generally better results without a flash . However , when taking close-up pictures with a flash , the A570IS doesn't seem to select anything lower then ISO 200 , sometimes requiring a manual ISO override in Program mode . The A570IS offers a new ISO 1600 mode , but I 'm not quite sold on it . Without a tripod , under low light conditions , ISO 1600 does offer the opportunity for blur-free photographs not possible with ISO 800 . But the level of noise and artifacts from the noise processing don't give a very usable picture . The A570IS raises the bar with optical image stabilization , which only works when the camera is held horizontally . One of the biggest limitations of consumer digital cameras is the need to hold the camera steady to get a clear shot . At higher zooms and in night shots this problem can be compounded . I 've taken a number of shots with and without IS , and it is useful but not a " magic bullet " for poor shots . Small details like far-away signs at night become clear when the IS is engaged . You can set the IS to run continuously during preview , only when the shutter is released ( slightly lower battery drain ) , only on vertical movement ( better for objects that are moving horizontally ) , or disabled ( I have yet to find a reason to do so ) . And , unlike many cameras I 've seen , the IS works in video capture mode . Like the A540 , the A570IS offers full manual controls . With the A570IS , Canon adds two more modes ( Kids & Pets and Indoor ) to the mode selector wheel ( instead of having to find them on the Special Scene menu ) . The A570IS also adds a new Aquarium scene mode , while removing the useless Color Swap and Color Accent modes . Canon has also removed the " My Camera " customization menu ( for changing the startup picture and various sounds ) which I never used on my A540 . Although I never expected to use it , the movie mode is excellent . It 's still not a replacement for a dedicated camcorder . But I have used it on a number of occasions to capture audio and video when a picture just won't do . Standard movie mode is 640x480 ( VGA ) quality at 30fps , but you can raise the capture to 60 fps at 320x240 , or lower it to 15fps at 160x120 . The A570 can now capture video up to 1 hour or 4GB whichever comes first . Video files are very large ( around 1.9MB / second at 30fps ) but they compress extremely well with QuickTime Pro 's MPEG4 codec . With the A570IS , Canon also addressed some of my minor complaints about the A540 . Most notably , the LCD screen is much higher quality and higher resolution . The case plastics seem more solid , the small rubber door covering the USB - A / V - power ports pivots open from the side not the top , and the handle area no longer has a chrome insert which had a tendency to fall off . The ring that covers the conversion lens adapter mount has a chrome trim , making the camera more attractive but at least on my A570IS it is more difficult to remove than the A540 . Once again , I looked at the Canon A710IS which offers a 6x optical zoom , but has the same 7.1MP sensor , optical image stabilization and user interface with the older Digic II image processor . In the end , after trying both cameras in the store , I again settled on the A570IS . The A710IS is noticeably larger ( about 0.25 inches wider and slightly taller ) , and the more complicated lens takes longer to startup and to zoom . Both cameras have a limited number of stops in their zoom range , but this is noticeable on the 6x of the A710IS where it is not noticeable in the 4x of the A570IS . For me , the larger size wasn't worth the extra zoom . And the benefits of Digic II are impressive . In summary , Canon A570IS Pros : - 7.1 megapixel sensor , 4x optical zoom - ISO 80 to 1600 - optical image stabilization for higher ISO or zoom , even during video capture - optical viewfinder for shooting with the LCD off - full manual controls ( shutter priority , appeture priority , full manual ) - preset and custom white balance control - outstanding photo quality , even in relatively low light ( good color balance , very low noise at higher ISOs , almost non-existent chromatic aberation ) - Digic II processor offers face detection , makes more intelligent decisions on exposure , and flash levels - very good results from built-in noise reduction for slow shutter speeds of 1.3 seconds or greater - very fast startup and shot-to-shot speed ( flash not withstanding ) - excellent and speedy auto-focus even in low light ( although the AF assist light can slow this down ) - orientation sensor recognizes if you have rotated the camera to take a shot - flash adjusts angle based on wide-telephoto zoom - built-in red eye reduction during playback lets you select an area to remove red eye and save as new or overwrite the existing image - surprisingly usable movie mode - outstanding user interface : options are well laid out and easy to locate , very well thought-out record and playback options - extremely fast user interface and playback performance , even zooming in on photos - high resolution LCD screen - well built case , very comfortable grip - uses SD cards and supports high-capacity SDHC ( takes advantage of high-speed SD ) - uses 2 AA batteries ( at least 2500 mAh NiMh rechargeable recommended ) - very good battery life ( approx 400 shots on 2 rechargeable NiMh AA , with the display on ) - replaceable lithium battery protects settings when changing batteries - supports optional high-power flash , conversion lenses and underwater caseCons ( to me , all very minor ) : - flash recharge time is acceptable but not great ( 4 - 6 seconds between shots using NiMh batteries ) - preview display blanks while flash recharges - Auto ISO for indoor flash close-up pictures doesn't seem to select below ISO 200 ; you can force ISO 100 in Program or manual modes - ISO 1600 is of questionable real-world use because of noise and artifacts from noise reduction - noise reduction cannot be adjusted or disabled - it is possible to insert the SD card upside down and you don't realize until you try to close the cover ( would be easy to break the cover if you force this ) - the markings for the battery orientation are difficult to read - no RAW image support , but you can select from 3 different compression ratios for image quality - bundled 16MB card is useless - buy a 2GB cardTIPS : 1 ) make sure you do a low-level format before you use your SD card in this camera , even if you had formatted it for another Canon camera . It makes a significant difference in shot-to-shot speed2 ) always use high-capacity ( 2500 mAh or greater ) NiMh rechargeable batteries - the flash recharge time is much improved ( though still 4-6 seconds ) 3 ) for indoor flash close-up shots , may need to override ISO to 100 for better quality4 ) for outdoor shots in bright sun , setting exposure - 2/3 gives better control of bright areas5 ) if you use the conversion lens adapter , don't plan on using the built-in flash which is partially obscured by the adapter . I haven't tried it , but would expect the external flash to not have this problem .  
1	  This thing broke on me the 4th time I used it , it wouldnt turn on . Its nice that it has the USB and SD card slots , so you can see any pictures you take . I am surprised at the other reviews , I thought the screen quality was lousy . Wouldve sent it back , but didnt get around to it on time . Next time I am just getting something that plays DVDs , the SD slots are nice but not what you will be doing most of the time ( at least me ) .  
1	  In so many ways it 's * almost * an iPod , but not quite . The new iPod shuffle and new iPod nano would make much better gifts .  
1	  Apple may be selling you a used ipod . I found out today that the ipod I paid $ 299.00 for was actually refurbished . It had been repackaged , presented and sold to me as a new ipod . This company has a class action lawsuit against it for this , among other claims . You can view the class action lawsuit by googling " tell on apple . " Don't get cheated the way I did ! And if you do buy an ipod , keep the receipt .  
1	  Let me make this clear . I have NEVER taken my printer off black and white settings . Despite that , I have had to replace my expensive color ink cartridges multiple times . This printer was designed to drain color ink tanks regardless of whether you use them . It mixes small amounts of color into the black and white printing to drain the tanks . If that wasn't unethical enough , here 's the real kicker : once a color cartridge is drained ( again , with only black and white printing ) , it will constantly demand you replace the ink cartridge EVERY time you click print . I have been screwed so many times by printing a document and walking away to get my shower only to find that when I 'm ready to head out the door the document NEVER PRINTED because I didn't click 2-3 times that I did not want to replace the ink cartridge that HP deliberately sabotaged to earn more money . I will never , ever , buy an HP printer again and I will do my research to find out what other manufacturers use these practices to inflate their profits so I can steer clear of them , too .  
2	  Pros :( + ) Best Sound Quality - Never heard my MP3 's play that good even on my computer . ( + ) Lots of Space - Plenty of room for my videos and my entire MP3 collection . ( + ) Compatibility - Plays DIVX , XVID , etc , no conversion needed , I put a dvd in my computer loaded up the program " iriverter " and in an hour I had converted a 3 hour movie ( the entire Scarface movie ) for my player , and it looks good on the screen . ( + ) Light weight - Given its size , I expected it to be heavier , it is relatively light weight . Cons :( - ) Thick - I can easily overlook this flaw because of all of the positives , and since it is still not heavy . But I can't wait for the technology that yields 80 gb video players the size of just the screen . Overall : 9.5/10 Highly reccomended , if you get this player I know you 'll be happy . If you compare it to ipod , its thicker , but it has features ipod doesn't have ( DIVX , XVID , FM Radio , More Compatible - MANY music services , more Software , you won't be tied to itunes only . )  
2	  So far I have used this camera to record storm damage and to create a photo for a web page . The last use enabled me to take 650 frames in a video of our pastor . With this choice it was not difficult to select a portrait quality picture for our web site .  
1	  Easy set up , worked great , for a little while . After a very short period , it just stopped working . Maybe it was just the one I bought , but I was very unhappy , especially since a fight ensued about who was going to replace it ( Still unresolved ) An update : After several months of arguing about whether the failure was software or a hardware issue , Microsoft finally agreed to replace the adapter . Of course I had already bought another from a different company , and they wouldn't simply refund the purchase price . The one I have works fine , so I haven't installed the replacement adapter and can't say if it works any better .  
2	  This was a very easy to install product , instructions were clear , craftsmanship is good . Its classic black look is exactly what we were looking for , and the price is very reasonable . Sound quality is great .  
2	  these little ear phones are very good i think are the best out there for the price , nice sound and comfortable  
2	  I bought this cover to help keep dirt out of my keyboard also to make it a bit quieter when I was typing in class . This does the job for both . I love it and it was so cheap . My only complaint is that it is a little bit " sticky " feeling and I sometimes feel like the space bar is hard to push ( not really an issue , I have pretty much gotten used to it ) but I have noticed that in the 3 weeks I 've been using this cover , the stickiness / rubber-feeling has started to go away so I have no doubt that in another week or two it will be fine . Definitely recommend this . Also , I haven't noticed any issues with the keyboard overheating .  
2	  I hadn't been on the market for banana plugs for over 10 years since I originally purchased my speakers , but they finally needed to be replaced . I love the improvement with the screw cap / locking mechanism , I noticed an immediate improvement in sound coming from my speakers . You can't go wrong with these !  
2	  I bought an I-Pod about a year ago , and those little earbuds hurt . I 've never met a single person who actually kept those things . At any rate , I knew I had to get a good pair of ear - or head-phones . So , I started looking around . After seeing all the positive reviews for this product , I decided to buy and haven't regretted it once . Here are some pointers for anyone thinking of buying these : 1 ) The foam inserts cause much more suction than the plastic ones ( at least , for me ) . Because of this , if you 're using while riding a bike , either use two plastic inserts or one plastic and one foam , as you 'll be able to pick up on background noise better . 2 ) I saw someone who complained of breathing and heartbeats distracting them while working out . This is a very easy problem to fix . As I said in the previous statement , the plastic inserts create less suction . Simply adjust the plastic inserts in your ear until you can no longer hear your heartbeats and breathing . Don't worry ' you 'll still be able to hear the music perfectly . These are very high-quality earphones . I haven't had a single problem with them . If you decide to buy these , I 'm sure you will be very happy with your purchase , just like I am !  
2	  I wish I 'd written when I first bought , because surely some didn't buy due to the other review , and I found this keyboard perfect . It 's small - like a laptop , but it 's necessary if you have a keyboard tray where your lap drawer would be on a desk , and it 's not gigantic . this allows me to have the keyboard and a wireless mouse ( full swize ) next to it , on the same level . I 've had it for a year or two , with NO PROBLEMS . LOVE IT .  
2	  Works very well . Nice strong signal in a 2400 sq . Ft . townhouse . Setup is a little confusing and there is no power switch necessitating unplugging to recycle the signal ( which has been needed a couple of times ) .  
2	  First Of All I Have To Say That I Used To Have 46 Meg Of Ram And My Computer Ran So Slow That I Got Tired Of Waiting For Everything To Happen . I Had To Wait 2 Minutes Just For Programs To Load Up . I Finally Got So Sick Of It That I Went Out A Bought This Gr8 256 Meg Of Ram Card Made By Viking . I Opened Up My Computer Thinking That This Would Make My Computer Run A Tad Bit Faster . I Installed The Chip And Turned On My Computer . I Must Say This Has To At Least Be 20x Faster Than My 46 Meg Of Ram And That Is Not An Exaggeration . I Could Definitely Tell A Huge Difference And I Would Definitely Reccomend This Card For Anyone That Is Tired Of Waiting For Their Computer And All Their Programs To Load Up . This Chip Also Will Solve The Problem Of Being Able To Open More Than 5 Programs At Once . If I Ever Had More Than 5 Programs Open Before I Had This Chip My Computer Either Froze Or Just Ran Slower Than I Have Ever Seen Any Computers Run Before . With This Viking Chip I Am Now Able To Have Up To 10 Programs Open At Once Without Any Stalling Or Problems . This Chip Is Definitely A Best Seller And If You Are Thinking About Buying It , Stop Thinking About It And Go Get It ! I Promise You Will Be Happy You Bought It And You Won't Regret It !  
1	  The sole reason I bought the reader was for the xD reader . and that works perfectly . however , i tried to use it with my SD card , like it claims it can do , and I actually broke it in half ( the card ) trying to put it in the reader . I really did not pay much for it , so being it serves it 's purpose . And I was able to still use the SD card after it broke , so I still can't complain too much . But if you are buying it for it 's " all-in-one " capabilities , don't .  
2	  I 've owned this for about a month now . I bought it for our bedroom , to connect to the Philips HDTV . While the subwoofer does not rattle the walls , the sound is actually pretty decent for size / price . It includes AM / FM radio , plus clock radio features - how cool is that . The rosewood laminate is well done , and the unit has some weight too . For a bedroom or home office , where you don't care about true Dolby 5.1 , and don't want to run a bunch of wires around , this is a pretty cool setup . And as I said before , the clock-radio feature is kinda like gravy . I will tell you that you can buy this for $ 110 , if you are a member of Sam 's Club . Power buys are the greatest . Amazon is good about pricing on most things , but sometimes they get beat pretty bad . Buy this little beast at Sam 's if you can . This is a progressive scan DVD drive , so it will do great on HDTV , and it includes Dolby Digital .  
1	  I gave it 2 stars because it is quality made . It is useless to me for my canon 50d with battery pack and extra 70-300 lens and the 28-130 mounted .. It is way too small and even barely of use for my nikon 90d . It is totally uncomfortable on the shoulder . I had really expected more from Isreali made products for better R and D. . I guess I now am stuck with a 100 $ lunch pack which really sucks more as I researched this bag and others and this won . The others would have really sucked . It may work for smaller consumer cams but not mine .. Only worse gamble would have been to put it in a slot machine .. I lost big on this hand  
1	  The sound was fine . The problem was after less than 1 week if I paid $ 93.00 for them I do not expect the ear foam piece on the left side to come off from just removing them from my head . Amazon is very cool about returning an item because they are on the way today . Some people may think it is a easy fix but I looked at thinking if this happens in less than one week I am returning them I will use my $ 25 Sennheiser headphones until I decide my next decision but sorry it will not be a replacement of the same . Thanks Gin for your help .  
1	  Dear Sirs , Probably the most dissatisfied with an order that I have ever been . I paid for next day shipping , the item arrived 2 days short of a week later . The outer USPS container was in Excellent Condition . The two inner boxes were preopened , crushed , contained no instructions or hardware , and one of the units was bent and twisted sideways . I probably will not ever attempt to use these or even see if they work as they obviously have been mishandled . In the nearly a week time that I spent waiting for this " next day " delivery , I found better professionally packaged , units at a more reasonable price . First time , " LAST TIME " customer  
2	  I purchased this for a Dell D610 . Received it on time and it fit correctly in slot . Have used it for a week and avg . charge is better than 2 hours of normal work . As is always the case there will probably be some defective units but from the enclosed letter with the battery I feel the company will correct the problem .  
2	  I bought this for my husband for Christmas and all in all it lives up to the reviews that I had read before . I like that it is easy to use and set up . My only dislike is that I feel the maps it came preloaded with are out of date . We recently drove down to the coast of NC and there was a new bypass that has been open for a while . The preloaded map did not have the new road on it . We contacted Magellan who said an update only comes out about every 18mths and there is not one currently scheduled . Disapointing as we live in an area of large growth .  
2	  This system has been a blessing for me . I used to print CD 's one at a time and it was a real pain . As my business grew I needed more power . I recieved this two days before my daughter was born and set it up to use while I was on PAternity duty . It setup easy and ran very low maintenance . I was running it on a computer that was doing nothing but that , and technically not up to the spec they recommend . Occassionally I have to reboot the machine , but that 's the case with any windows machine . I think it approx . 18 months I have likely burned and printed about 6000 CD 's . Business is growing again and I recently bought a high speed duplicator . That machine cost me $ 1100 and will do 11 CD 's or 43 seconds for me so my bravo is just used for printing now . I strongly recommend this . It 's not perfect , but nothing with moving parts that is used alot is going to be no maintenance forever . This machine has been a stud for me ..  
2	  I use these to work out in the gym ( weight lifting ) for about 3 weeks . The sound is top notch . Ultimately , they need to be durable . Thus far they have fulfilled my expectations .  
2	  This was a Father 's day gift . This radio works great right out of the box . It was easy to install in my 2006 Toyota Van and looks great just sitting in there . The weather channel is an excellent extra feature for South Louisiana where we sometimes get Hurricanes during the Summer . The squelch is sensitive and works good . The RF gain really does what it is supposed to do . The only problem was adjusting the SWR on the Lil Wilson Antenna I purchased with this radio . Once the SWR was properly set his baby could and does really talk out . The front firing speaker is nice and clear and easily heard . I like the fact the speaker faces the front and not down into the carpet . After much tinkering I was able to adjust the SWR down to about 1:1 to 1:2 on the most popular channels . The other channels are higher but not enough to damage the radio . This is the first time I used a Wilson brand antenna . I don't know if I would purchase another Wilson although a lot of people like them . I would definitely recommend this radio for general everyday CB use in any car . A good antenna set with the correct SWR makes all the difference in the world .  
2	  Even though Elgato sounds a bit like ACME to me , I have to say they know what they 're doing . This little device is great and works very well . I like the fact that you can see both analog and ATSC broadcast with a single antenna transparently , just switch the channel . Image quality is great , although it eats quite a bit of CPU to decode and show HDTV , but with the Intel Macs it 's not really a problem . The software needs a bit of refinement , especially on the program guide . They have really cool features , like you can set up a recording over the web using Titan TV if you 're at work , for example , and forgot about that soccer game at 3 PM today . On the other hand , if you 're in the guide and click on a program that 's running now , it doesn't automatically retune to that channel , you have to go and change it yourself . I like the integration with Front Row and the Apple remote . I 'm enjoying this new toy .  
2	  Read the reviews posted on Amazon . I decided to give it a try as my first monopod purchase . I can't believe the difference it makes when shooting with a heavy camera / lens . I was able to take my time shooting photos because I wasn't weighed down by the weight of my telephoto lens . It 's super easy to use , comfortable to hold while shooting , very adjustable , lightweight ( yet sturdy ) , and compact enough to carry with you . I wish someone had recommended a monopod to me a long time ago ! My shots are sharper than without the monopod . Monopod more than exceeded my expectations . Would highly recommend it .  
2	  I am so glad I ordered this DVD / VCR combo . I still have a lot of movies on VHS so rather than get rid of them , purchase the movies all over again on DVD , I decided to order this wonderful machine . Now I can enjoy all my favorite old movies and my favorite new releases on the same machine . I love it !  
2	  This was exactly what I was looking for to work with my existing Comcast cable box . The only problem was the " Cable " button was locked and I did not know that until I searched around on the internet for about 30 min . I think the seller should send a note with the remote , because the directions do not tell you how to do this . How to unlock : 1 . Press CABLE key2 . Press and hold SETUP unit CABLE blinks twice3 . Type 982If it blinks four times , now it 's unlocked and you can assign the proper cable box code to your remote .  
2	  > Things I love : 12 foot cord . Flat plug that angles off , not blocking other outlet . Price . Fast delivery . > Things I don't love : my inability to look at the picture and realize that it 's dark gray . I checked out other " white " surge protectors and my poor brain must 've been clogged . Would help clogged brains if final order description included the words " dark gray " . > Things that don't matter : the warranty . They are counting on consumers not to jump through their loops . If all consumers who experienced a loss carried out their claims , Belkin would need to charge at least $ 100 for this surge protector , or else go out of business , filing bankruptcy . However , they can offer you $ 200,000 replacement because they feel secure that your equipment will be protected . > Things I 'm willing to do : jump through all the loops if my TV gets fried . > Things I don't understand : why I 'll pay $ 1500 + for our new TV and not more heavily research surge protectors , too . Well , after 35 years of never having any electrical or electronic equipment get fried using simple wall outlets as well as surge protectors , I 'll take my chances on this affordable , quality product . > Things Amazon ( or Belkin ? ) could do : 1 ) Update description by describing color . 2 ) Make note that older reviews are of the product when it included 12 outlets . 3 ) remove the giddy review excerpt about " 12 outlets ! " that precedes the reviews . No longer applies .  
1	  I bought this as needed a power strip and thought the color coding would make life easier with the TV and components . Several of the plugins died within a month . Threw it away and bought a " normal-basic " , cheaper Home Depot one and have had not problems .  
1	  I have always used the " compatible " printer cartridges simply because of the cost . I make tons of copies and the ink or brand name laser cartridges just cost too much . I have always been very satisfied with the quality of the print of the compatible cartridges until this one . It seems to put a small black line down the left edge of every page . It 's possible that it 's a problem with my printer but it wasn't doing this until I put in the replacement cartridge . Otherwise , the price is great and I 've had no other problems . I 'll go back to using other brands of compatible cartridges when this one runs out . 12/23/10 OK , a couple of months have passed and I am already on the " Low Toner " warning ! I have NEVER chewed through a cartidge this fast so I am added to the list of folks who did not get anywhere near the promised 2500 page yield . THEN , to add insult to injury , I had purchased 2 of these cartidges at the same time so I would have a spare ready and the second one is not recognized . What a pain ! I will find out the manufacturer of the other " compatible " cartridges that I have used in the past . They were fantastic ! These are not . Don't waste your time . these are NOT less expensive .. these are cheap .  
2	  This is number two for us . Two adults and two teens have used this mouse ( and it 's predecessor ) for daily purposes for more than 6 yrs . The only reason we 've had two is the cable on the first one ( on the mouse end ) just couldn't last beyond 6 yrs . The mechanism in the mouse is still completely functional ( and the cable will get repaired as soon as time permits ) .  
1	  I got this and it seemed like the right item . The box packaging was for HWU8DD , then opened it , tried to use it , and WHOOPS ! Looks like Hawking decided to put the model HWU8DDA . Mac only model ! However the packaging said " Windows Vista " the drivers say " Windows Vista " and the loose paper said " Windows Vista " , however the HWU8DDA is NOT PC compatible . Lovely ! I 'm now stuck with a $ 60 worthless device . Or maybe I 'll convert to Mac after 20 years , just to use this ..  
1	  First one arrived but did not display photos properly . The images were off-center so that the center of the photo was pushed down and to the right by about 2 inches . This pushed the far right of the photo to the far left of the picture frame and the bottom of the photo to the top of the screen . Returned it to Amazon and ordered a replacement . Second one arrived with the same problem , but the images were only off-center by about . 75 inches . If the glitch in the units just shifted the photo down and to the right so that part of the photo was just missing or offscreen , I might not even notice or care for most of my photos , but the glitch pushed the image down and right but reproduces the " lost " part on the left and top , which really made it hard to look at the photos . I 'm trying a different brand .  
1	  I live only a few miles from a repeater tower and this antenna couldn't pick up any local channel at all . The channels it did pick up were really low signal . The antenna that came with my other TV picks up all local channels just fine and in HD in perfect quality . Not sure why this antenna failed so badly , but just a fair warning to anyone out there thinking of it .  
2	  Well , it has a variety of screwdrivers and other tools useful for working on your computer . In my case , I was disassembling a laptop , so some of the tools cannot be used because only desktop computers require them . But I can see how if I 'm assembling a desktop computer , they would come in handy . The only complaint I have is that since I was working on a laptop , some of the screws are too small to be used by even the smallest screwdriver in this set . That can be easily remedied by a $ 2 eyeglass repair kit from a local drug store , though . I really liked the yellow tool that allows you to pull small screwdrivers out of their sockets when unscrewed . I was looking at the other kit with a soldering iron , but decided that I 'd rather buy a higher quality soldering iron separately , so I went with this one . Can't imagine most people to have any problems with this set , except when working on laptops .  
1	  The case looks exactly as in the pictures above , and the camera fits perfectly in it . However , the case is hardly a protection , it 's not to be considered as more than a carrying bag . The velcro that keeps it closed is quite easy to open so I 've dropped the case a few times while walking outdoors . Fortunately the case is designed to use the straps on the camera for carrying it around , so my camera stays with me in any event . There is a little strap on the case , supposedly to attach the case to the camera or to the straps , but it opens too easily , so it can't be trusted at all ( the strap almost opens by the very weight of the case , which is not much ) . There is also a small pocket in the back , providing barely room enough for a set of replacement batteries ( 4 AA batteries ) and the USB cable . Again , the velcro on it is too easy to open , even more after placing the batteries and the cable inside the pocket . Definitely , this is not designed as a practical solution . Just enough to protect the camera from dust and some scratches . If you value your equipment and want to protect it from more than the wind and the sun , while not being worried of losing the case around - or its contents , DON'T buy this one . Spend some more money and get a decent carrying case . I will .  
2	  Product was packaged well and arrived quickly . My order was even shipped free , what more could you ask for ?  
1	  The belt clip ripped within days with only light use . The velcro is noisy and the open ends are of concern .  
1	  Camera WAS simple to use , but died 2 weeks after buying-screen is now only black and won't take picture . Instruction manual is a waste of paper . We 'll see what Kodak says about warranty service . Pics were ok , lots of red-eye and lots of blur if you were not still as a statue . Screen could be brighter for outside use . Don't plan on using the LCD in the sun . Lots of features on this camera , but appears it still needs some development work .  
2	  Product was exactly what i expected and shipped fast . Maybe it 's because i live in the next city but i got my product the next day .  
2	  I recently bought this item . The GPS functions are great but take a little getting used to . Your can plan a trip and the PIN 570 will tell you where to turn and quite cleaverly if you decide to take a different rout it will re compute the rest of the journey after warning that you have deviated from planned rout . It can be set to avoid toll roads and for varous ather settings . As well as GPS devive its a regular PDA with adress , phone numbers , games and other utilities that run under Winsows Mobile .  
1	  I wish I could give 0 stars . Like many of the other reviewers , our laptop lock reset .. while locked to our nightstand in a hotel room in Italy . We used the laptop lock successfully for about a year , so we were quite sure of the combination . And when we went to unlock the laptop this time , the combo didn't work . My husband began trying each of the possible 10,000 combinations , and after two hours of sitting in a hotel room instead of being on our actual vacation , we borrowed cable cutters from the hotel and cut the lock , in about 25 seconds ( so the lock is worthless anyway ) . Back at home , he continued trying to find the combo to get the lock out of the actual computer ( after trying to cut it out - didn't work ) and finally hit upon the winning reset combination as 4444 . This product is completely worthless and the company should be sued , especially since they are now fully aware of the defect and yet continue to sell the same product ! Incredible ! We didn't even try calling the company considering the response others received - I wasn't about to add to my frustration by making an expensive , international phone call as useless as the product itself . Unfortunately , we bought our lock before all these reviews popped up , but hopefully , so many customers experiencing the same problem will help future buyers .  
2	  This is a very good inexpensive investment for your digital camera if you don't want the screen to get all scratched up .  
2	  I don't know about monitors , but it keeps my kats from sleeping on Electronics I don't want them the sleep on . The extra elevation lets them monitor anything should they wish to pounce on . However , I would like to know if additional legs pieces are available ? If so please let me know the source ! Richard  
1	  Attractive and easy to install . I expected at least some base from the speakers . With no low end they sound very tinny . All and all I am dissappointed with the product and would not recommend it .  
2	  I bought this product several months ago , and I have been burning my own mix of music via iTunes . No problems so far and they look real cute , just like old records . My batch actually came in multi-color , so it 's not just the yellow color shown on Amazon 's product photo . I am purchasing another round of 50 today !  
1	  I was forewarned about the outcome results about this product . What a waste of time & ( money ) paying a premium sum for non-productive results . Over 75 % of these disc were completely usless . I was totalaly LIVID because of such a waste , I went back to Memorex & SONY Noo Problem . Spending HOURS REchecking all connections , Diagnostic testing , Compressed-Air cleaning , Checking service manuals , final conclusion ( malfunction product ) . NEVER AGAIN !  
2	  these banana plugs are very nice , and they are pretty heavy meaning they are solid and built well . Even though they are a little pricey , they are definately worth the extra $ 10 to spend on these plugs vs . others . The ease of installation is also a plus . The install is clean , leaving no wires hanging out .  
1	  This hardware does not live up to its promise . It cannot maintain a stable connection , and high connection speed in a " real life " environment . I am using it to connect my desk top to my wireless home network . My router ( a 802.11g D-Link ) is 25-30 feet away obstructed by only a wall ( you know couple of drywall sheets and some 2x4s ) and the signal strength is always below 20 % with speeds only up to 2.0 Mbps . All my other wireless devices have full speeds and strengths at the same spot ( where i have the D-link adapter ) .  
1	  No blocking equipment can be truly effective unless the live caller is required to enter a pin or password . Just a list of numbers permitted to call through makes it difficult to keep up with one time callers that you want to receive e.g. A delivery person whose number you will not know in advance .  
2	  I have about a hundred movies and several seasons of TV Shows and this case has so much storage space I feel the urge to go movie shopping !  
2	  This cable is every bit as good as the high price cables that are on the market . Get one from this vendor .  
2	  I ordered these headphones looking for something that I could workout with and could supply me with good sound for my music . I got both with this purchase . The only problem some might find is these are headphones with heavy bass , but I love that part of them the most .  
1	  dont buy this unless u want ur ipod to fall out constantly and the clip to break the first day u get it  
2	  Arrived less than 2 weeks after initial order submission . Beautiful picture , very dark blacks , vibrant accurate colors . Amateurs will complain about the pincushion effect in 4:3 mode , but that 's natural on ANY projection-based tv . Hooked up a PS3 ( via HDMI ) as the final quality check . Blu-ray movies look stunning in native 1080p resolution , and games look breathtaking .  
1	  Do not buy this product . I had a Pioneer which worked rather well , but I decided to upgrade my CD recorder since I often compliled new CDs for my restaurant . Unfortunately , this purchase was a major disappointment . Although it is fairly easy to program the music ; the recording part is very frustrating . For example , if you are recording from an external source , say a carousel-type CD player , you cannot set the program , leave for 80 minutes , come back and enjoy a new CD . Why ? Because the record function stops after 1.8 seconds . Should the CD player change CDs within the carousel the recording will stop . I called the Philips hot line for help , but they could only tell me , " sorry that 's the way it was designed . " Another problem occurs with internal recording . Sometimes the machine acts like it has the voodoo . Inexplicably the recording will stop ( you can tell when the timer stops ) , but the display reads that recording is in progress . This freezes the machine and prevents you from doing anything else . You must remove the plug to move forward and sometimes that doesn't even work ! There are better machines out there , find them and buy them . Ignore this turkey .  
2	  I get terrible headaches from using CRT 's that refresh under 85 Hz and from a majority of flat panel monitors . After a month of searching for a monitor that I could use at work ( after my CRT died ) we found this NEC 90GX2 that I 've now been using for a year and is absolutely fabulous . No more headaches . My vision went from 20/15 to 20/60 using a " bad " monitor for 3 weeks and is about 20/25 now . I 'm told it won't go back to 20/15 . I highly recommend this monitor with a very good graphics card - either Nvidia or AMD .  
1	  Logitec states on the web site that this joystick works with the Mac OS . That means that the drivers work with the Mac OS . When I received it , the box says PC ( only ) . So then I checked the web site , and despite the misleading assertion that it works with the Mac OS , the download options are only for Windows . When I called , the support guy flatly asserted that proper operation dictates that you set the buttons within the game . I responded and asked why that is not normal operation for Windows , since the buttons can be configured within any game in any case - for both operating systems ? Why bother to supply Windows drivers ? He didn't answer that , but then compounded one misleading assertion with a bald faced lie , namely that Apple won't let anyone else access their operating system for drivers . I asked it that was true for keyboards as well , and he responded in the affirmative . I then asked if that is true , why is Microsoft able to supply Mac drivers for their keyboards ? Why is Razer able to supply Mac drivers for mice , keyboards , and their game pad ? Finally , to really underscore how misleading Logitec is , I noticed that they supply Mac drivers for the G13 game board , but I have not tried those yet . They probably don't work either . I am returning this as a flatly defective unit , since Logitec asserts that it works with Macs which means it has Mac drivers . Since it is does not , it is defective . Let Amazon return it to Logitec as defective , so Logitec eats the return . I encourage anyone else to do the same . So long as Logitec engages in deceptive advertising - and has tech support that is equally disingenuous - then any sales of this device for Macs should be returned as flatly defective . The flat assertion that Logitec can't make Mac drivers for this device is beyond misleading and disingenuous . Razer does it , as does Microsoft . And it appears that Logitec even does it for other devices . The false advertising and disingenuous and misleading statements by Logitec tech support means the company is the used car dealer of gaming devices .  
2	  I recently bought an ASUS 1000he netbook . One of the features missing from netbooks is an optical drive and at first I thought this might be a deal breaker . Then I found this 16Gb SDHC card from Transcend at Amazon . The netbook had an SDHC card reader installed . Problem solved , plenty of portable memory , no optical disks to travel with and on sale at 19.99 .  
1	  The frustrating part of this product is that when it works , it is not a bad product . It 's when the connection issues start up that it becomes incredibly irritating . I have used this keyboard for over a year with only keyboard lag as the only problem , which in itself is minor . I had also used it on my Wii , Xbox 360 successfully . However , for the past year or so , the keyboard and mouse simply do not connect with any consistency . More often than not , the keyboard and receiver simply do not connect to one another . When it does connect , typing is impossible : the shuffle key is " t " for some reason and " q " key is " r " . I simply hate this product now , which is a shame , because I use other Logitech products for years with great confidence , such as the Harmony remotes and webcams . I don't think there is a warranty on this product for the LX 710 , but I do not think I will be buying another Logitech wireless keyboard or mouse for a very long time .  
1	  I got this router to hook up to both a cable and DSL uplink . Unfortunately , in spite of extended tinkering with the router 's settings I could not connect from my laptop to the VPN at work . With my old Linksys WRT54G this worked fine out of the box . BTW , this was with only a single uplink hooked up . I also tried this with the Xincom XC-DPG502 , same problem . I am planning to try the Draytek 2910 next .  
1	  The company that said they had this Tripp Lite U022-015 15-Feet USB2.0 Certified Gold A / B Device Cable lied . They attached themselves to the Amazon description page , as one of the " others with this product for sale " Obviously , I went with them , because their price was very cheap , and since I was getting the exact same Tripp Lite USB cable , I would be coming out ahead , right ? ! What I recieved was a thin , no-name cable with nickel plated connections instead of gold , and no description of double shielding , etc . I don't know how they think it is OK to bait and switch like that . Unfortunately , I didn't have time to return and reorder , but luckily we haven't had any problems yet . We have been having connection issues , and possible noise interferrence , and really needed the Tripp Lite to help us rule out the sources of these problems , but ultimately had to ship what we were given . I could have gotten other no name brand USB cables cheaper through my regular cable supplier , had I known I would not in fact be recieving the Tripp Lite that was being advertised . I 'm not educated enough in the Amazon process of adding to a listing like this , claiming to have the same product for a price , so I don't blame Amazon . I am hoping , of course , that there is some claims department that will sanction a seller like this for false advertisement . It is in Amazon 's best interest to keep the buyers happy in a situation like this .. Again , I don't think the Tripp Lite cable is bad - I didn't recieve those to test . I also am not directly blaming or suggesting malfeasance on the part of Amazon , but rather the seller " Cmple " for thinking it is OK to claim to have something , and switch it with what they really had the whole time . They never had the name brand more expensive , double shielded , gold plated USB cable . They just used the product description page as a clearing house for their cheap cables .  
2	  This is a decent product . Easy to put together even for a senior female like me . Holds almost as many DVDs as it claims . Would get more .  
1	  I bought this product because I have had Jensen products in the past and been pleased with them . This radio / cd player however , is JUNK ! the maximum volume is very low and completely in-audible with the shower running . Even in a quiet room - the volume is barely above a whisper . So don't buy it - you will be very frusterated and have an essentially useless product on your hands .  
1	  I ordered the 21/22 cartridge combination because that 's what the web page told me to order . It was wrong . I need HP 60 ( CC640W and CC643W ) . I don't know how to return it and get the right ones . Can someone advise me ?  
1	  This worked well for the application but the batteries just kept on dieing in the remote . If they had a larger remote with AA batteries I would have given it a 4 .  
1	  It is not worth your time , money or effort on this product . It is way too short once you bolt it to the car seat floor ; the DVD player will sit about 6 inches from the ground . You 'd do better putting the DVD player on a cardboard box than using this worthless piece of garbage . Then once you 've opened the plastic bag , you 've voided any chance to return it .. DON'T waste your money !  
2	  I bought these v-modas a couple of months ago . I love them so much that I just bought a second pair for myself and a pair for my wife . The sound is excellent - better than that of my Shure E2Cs and other earphones I have tried . Sound isolation is also fabulous . Highly recommended !  
1	  I expected it to work easily . After testing it on my tv and trying all the channels , I was getting different frequencies from radio station but none from my tv set .  
2	  This belt clip is simple but just what I was looking for . It is easy to use and does the job . I had a hard time finding one , but it was worth the wait ..  
1	  The sound on this unit is very nice , and the controls are easy to use but other than that it 's a total lemon . Unfortunately , the battery on ours stopped holding any charge at all so the unit must remain plugged in to use it . That 's a major downsize since we liked to move it around the house without the hassle . Also , on our Gen 3 nano , it causes a problem where the volume just goes up and up until it reaches the maximum . The nano does this even after it 's unplugged from the dock until you issue a reset command . This of course loses some of the settings so we only use the dock with our Gen 2 nano at this point .  
2	  I use it every day in the car . It works very well . I couldn't find the better price than this .  
2	  I loved these speakers . They were loud and the bass really boomed . It was because of these speakers that we quit using a separate stereo system all together . Hooked to our computer we had a much larger selection of music to chose from . I would be using these to this day if the volume control didn't quit working . Unfortunately without that piece the whole system is useless . They did last almost seven years though so it was money well spent .  
2	  Am I missing something ? I bought it , charged the battery for a few hours , upgraded my pc to Windows Media Player 10 , loaded the v2.3 firmware , started ripping from my cd 's and syncing to my H-10 . Then sync 'd a few pics from my hard-drive . Was just too easy . And I know vitually nothing about this kind of stuff , I 'm just a hack . Now , I haven't used a subscription service yet , so maybe that will present problems , but who knows . Manual is not particularly engaging <understatement> . I love running with my iRiver . So far the only thing that has presented a problem is the awkwardness of the belt clip on the plastic sleeve . The plastic sleeve is very handsome in my opinion , but the actual belt-clip is not user friendly . A minor complaint . Now , iRiver really should include the cradle with the product bundle , that would be a courtesy . Earbuds are okay for comfort , everybody has different ears , but think the sound quality is excellent . So far so good .  
2	  This is the coolest battery . It 's tiny , recharges fairly quickly , and keeps all my mobile USB devices powered for hours . It 's great for long trips .  
2	  I 've been after one of these for months as you all know in todays world we have so many usernames and passwords to remember . Most people have system or use the same passwords but then you get to a site that wont except you normal combination ! Well this little device has worked every time for me . Easy installation , one reboot and you are ready to go . Use it to logon to windows ( not domain though ) and then open up internet explorer and start registering sites . The other major disappointment with this reader is that it doesnt work out of the box with firefox , which is bad as this is what I use most of the time but .. the good news is that there is an extension ( plugin ) for firefox that lets you use it , its by no means full proof but its a step in the right direction . $U$  
2	  Prompt order fulfillment , and great price for this OEM product which I ordered as a replacement for use with my Dell Axim X51v PDA .  
2	  This lil mp4 player is the best right now . I have owned one for over a year now , i use mine every day at college and in my car . The touch pad is sweet , gives it smooth navigation , no clicking and clacking . PROS - The LCD on here is BRILLIANT Samsung .. i have compared against the 16.7 million color ( this has 240,000 ) creative player and this one wins hands down . waay better color representation , and the blacks are black not all gray and blotchy .. and lastly the SOUND IS AWSOME ! has deep bass not found on others , also has bit expantion and SRS for a full and encompassing sound . CONS - the only issue it has is the video playback is only 20fps , ( though most movies are only 24 fps ) , so some chop when panning across scenes . also has issues playing some older converted avi 's . all in all has a few video issues , but to be expected since its an music player first . but this is a very great buy , quality built with a metal back similar to the ipod . great great sound , easy interface , plenty of room , FM tuner and recorder , read text files on it , built in mic , and plays most file formats and easy to load , just drag and drop music onto it and your good , no converting audio files , just video .. so buy it you should be impressed .  
1	  I have a similar unit and for the most part it works OK . However , HP decided to use only a SD expansion slot . Very few accessories go into this slot . Most accessories require a larger CF slot which some of the competition offer on their units . For HP you must by a CF slot accessory + the GPS unit or camera , etc .  
2	  I recieved this for Christmas and loved ir so much that I gave 6 of them this year to friends and family .  
2	  A lot of people seem to spend a lot on their digital music players and then pair them with cheap headphones / earbuds . But , like home stereos , you 're better off spending more on your speakers than on the electronics . I 've paired these with an MP3 player that is less than $ 20 and the result sounds fantastic . These are simply a great set of earbuds . I 'm finally hearing a decent amount of bass from my music and , in a lot of cases , details that I 've never heard from a portable music system . Buy these . You won't regret it . By the way , these are much better than the Super . fi 3 's . After getting the 5 's , I thought I 'd get the 3 's for my wife to use at the gym . The 3 's have noticably less bass capabilities . Stick with the 5 's , if you can .  
1	  garbled , distorted sound with fade in and out . Now I have to spring for return postage .  
2	  Once again excellent service . Job well done ! I 've ordered several things from amazon and have never been disappointed . I recommend that you can buy from them with confidence .  
1	  Product worked for less than a month before left ear bud shorted out . Poor quality .  
2	  I got tired of my Phillips , Sony and Memorex headphones . I wanted a good ( but affordable ) headphone set . I got these HD497s after a previous good experience with a smaller Sennheiser a few years back . At first - I was not impressed . The sounds came out clean and such but no " turbo boost " per se . Then I tried the same music cds with my Philips - I was shocked . I had been used to poor music quality because of usage with Philips and Sony headphones . The Sennheisers are great . Not good for portable ( read IPOD walking / running / outdoor ) but awesome for usage at home on your stereo or on your computer . Worth it at twice the price . Unbelieveable ranges and the same music Im discovering THE FULL RANGE OF SOUNDS !  
2	  When the player finally arrived , I was ecstatic . The look of the player was gorgeous and the machine was so sleek and light , and I loved the long cord of the remote , because I tend to store my CD Player in a bag as I walk around . The remote-usage for fairly easy to use , even though the user manual is virtually useless . However , I e-mailed iRiver support and received enormous help , so that 's that . The free bag is useless as well , so I suggest you get another carrying case or something . The only problem I really have with the player is the battery-life , and the batteries that are part of the extension are kind of cumbersome when I want to carry my player around . However , I 'm willing to pay the price for good-quality music . Besides , the player comes with a charger , which is enormously useful when I 'm just sitting around at home , trying to block out all the sounds . The earphones are adequate , but I purchased another set of earphones by Sony on some other reviewer 's recommendation . I don't regret it , but I don't find the new set too necessary . The player worked incredibly well , but it lagged on some tracks . When I inserted a burned CD with mp3 files , it started freezing on certain files , but I have to admit that it was probably because the CD was damaged . There 's some lag time between tracks , but it 's negligible . Oh , and the biggest thing that bugs me about the player is the loud noises it makes while running . I 'm planning on e-mailing iRiver support and asking some questions . It 's annoying and irritating to listen to the player run . However , all in all , the player is a great investment . I plan on using it for years to come , and the sound quality is just wonderful . I truly enjoy it .  
2	  I bought this accessory shortly after my purchase of a TI83 + . There are * so * many programs available on the internet that will help you with day-to-day things , a must have for students . You can transfer programs from your computer to your calculator , every create your own programs using your home computer with the included software ! It works well , have not had any problems with it , the same with all of the TI products I own . If you want to transfer games , or programs , or even update your TI Calc , be sure to grab this accessory .  
2	  I like mine so much that I 'm buying another pair of Steiner Safari binoculars from Amazon as a gift . The pair I have are perfect for all around travel use . They 're small enough to fit into a pocket while trekking to a good birding spot and are unobtrusive around the neck on safari . They 're powerful enough to pull those wildlife sightings in close but don't force you to steady them on a tripod because of too much power . I 've taken them on two African safaris , to Iguazu Falls in South America and most recently birding on the Mekong River in Laos . I found that an added bonus was the rubber coated shell , allowing them to get banged around without damage . Their small size also means less room in your carry-on luggage as well as being easily hidden when traversing shaky Third World city streets . Guides on my travels who 've taken a look are always thoroughly impressed . For the money the Steiner Safari can't be beat !  
2	  Given that this is my first scanner , some of my enthusiasm for its features and ease-of-use might simply be naivete . On the other hand , having a fairly deep technical background , I think my appreciation of this unit 's abilities and organization are mostly based on Uniden 's exceptional design . Over and over I find that this unit operates just as I 'd like it to , showing that it 's the clear result of several generations of refined scanner design . The BC-780XLT provides both traditional frequency scanning , as well as trunk-tracking . Traditional scanning lets you program frequencies into memory banks , and then scan through them looking for active signals . You can also search ranges by programming the low and high endpoints , and having the scanner search between them for active frequencies . With 10 banks of 50 frequencies each , the BC-780XLT provides reasonable room for even the most crowded airwaves . ( And , as discussed further below , the ability to upload and download the scanner from a computer extends this ability significantly . ) Individual banks can be turned on and off , and individual channels can be explicitly locked out , allowing you to finely tailor your scan . Where this unit differs from traditional scanners is in its ability to track trunked systems . In such systems a small set of frequencies is shared by many different organizations ( e.g. , police , fire , public works ) , and rather than assigning fixed frequencies to specific units , the frequencies are assigned dynamically as needed . The result is that a single conversation may hop between frequencies as it progresses . Tracking this with a traditional scanner is nearly impossible , as a single frequency will play host to parts of different conversations , and a single conversation is strewn across multiple frequencies . The trunk-tracking scanner is able to use the information on the system 's control channel to follow the conversation , just like the radios of the participants . The result is that you follow a single conversation , rather than just a single frequency . Uniden offers several models of trunk-tracking scanner , including the lower-priced 895 , and the handheld 245 . The 895 is limited to tracking either trunked systems or traditional frequencies at any one time . The 780 ( and 245 ) , on the other hand , can intermingle trunk and regular frequencies within a single memory bank , and be set to scan through both of them , or between banks which contain any combination of trunked and standard frequencies . For me , where the 780 really excels is in its alphanumeric display . In addition to having an alpha tag for each channel , you are able to set up scan lists of talk group IDs . Talk group IDs represent a logical channel ( rather than a single frequency ) , such as the police department 's dispatch channels ( " Dispatch 1 " " Dispatch 2 " ) . When following a trunked system , the scanner tracks talk groups , rather than individual frequencies , and the labeling will show you an alpha tag for the talk group ( e.g. , " Tactical 1 " ) , rather than just he Motorola or EDACS ID number . This makes it much easier to know who you 're listening to . Public trunked systems are well documented ( either on the Web , or in publications such as " Police Call " ) , but for those that simply appear out of thin air ( you might stumble on a system 's control channel while searching frequency ranges , for example ) , the 780 will also help you find the full set of frequencies . Once you have found the control channel in a Motorola system , you can use a " control channel only " mode to ferret out the rest of the system 's frequencies . The 780 has a serial port through which the unit can be programmed or driven by computer . There are numerous software packages for accomplishing this , available through the many on-line 780 discussion groups and websites . It 's a good thing , too , as 500 channels , plus 10 trunk scan lists of 100 group IDs each ( 1000 total ) would be nearly impossible to program through the scanner 's front console . By keeping separate frequency files on your computer , you can easily download different sets of parameters ( i.e. , should you have more than 500 frequencies you want to keep track of ) . The front console and menu system are reasonably easy to understand , given the complex function available in this receiver . A novice user can get up and running with traditional frequency scanning very quickly , and the unit come with introductory frequency guides . Getting a trunked system programmed is a bit more work , but still not too complicated . The manual has most of the operational detail you 'll need , though it 's not always well organized as a reference ( e.g. , items mentioned in passing in one section may not be repeated elsewhere where you might go looking for it ) . The manual also contains a few mistakes . The numerous on-line discussion groups can help out if you get stuck . The reception with the included whip antenna is excellent in dense , urban areas . Where stations are weaker , obviously , an external antenna will be needed . The sound quality out of the bottom firing speaker is very listenable , though an external speaker ( for which a connection is included ) would improve the audio quality . The unit comes with both a wall-wart 120v adapter , as well as power cords for connection to a car battery and a car 's cigarette lighter . Reports of mobile usage have been very positive . Overall this has been a great purchase . I picked the 780 over the 895 primarily for the 780 's sophisticated alpha tagging system , and secondarily for its ability to track trunked and non-trunked systems at the same time . Both features have turned out to be essential to my enjoyment . Hopefully Uniden will get all of these features into a handheld unit !  
2	  When I turn on my Iphone music up to 75 % lound volume , it start making disturbing noise , for the best result , turn the MP3 player to < 50 % volume then turn the car volume up , it will have a good a clear sound . But for this super low price , I can not ask too much for 100 % perfect , overall I like it . By David Du ( Silicon Valley , CA )  
2	  Not much to say , works perfectly . Also works for Pontiac G8 . Since this adds length , it could rattle against door , or hit window , recommend you attach to door with wire ties or Velcro .  
1	  I should have read the reviews before purchasing it . Why would someone sell the item as a package when the package is not compatible ? I guess I now have a paper weight that is black and blue . How about thinking before selling !  
1	  I bought this unit to track how far I travel while walking . Thefirst unit received had bad segments in the LCD . Amazonquickly sent another unit that did appear to work . This unit takes a long time to find sattelites . Several timesit never found ANY , under clear blue sky . It just turned offafter 10 minutes . It would lose signal frequently . The deal breaker is that when it loses sattelites , it will not accountfor distance during the lost signal . Lets say you are walking / running , and the unit is logging distance . For a 10th of a mile , it losessattelite . When it gets sattelite back , it starts loggingagain from the new point . But it does NOT add the distanceyou traveled while the signal was missing . As if I teleportedto the new location . Useless .  
1	  I tried to convert the digital coax optical out from toshiba tv to digital optical in on sound bar . This converter did not work in sending sound from the tv to the sound bar .  
2	  We were very pleased with the speedy receipt of the product and the stated condition of the merchandise . Will purchase again from this vendor .  
1	  I also am one of those unfortunate to have an XTI that it does not work with .  
2	  I 'm very pleased with this purchase . Small , affordable , and easy to install . One thing that was confusing at first was the image focus . My face was blurry when the camera was initially installed and I couldn't find any place in the directions that talked about how to fix it . I finally discovered that the focus is done manually by adjusting the ring around the camera lens . After solving that , the camera has been perfect . The built in microphone also works really well .  
1	  I was attracted by its slim design and the canon name . What I got was a very cheaply manufactured and highly defective product with massive software problems . The moving arm is noisy and constantly gets jammed making scanning photographs a nightmare . The software for the Mac is of the bundled nature and crashes constantly . There is a jumble of five different titles which look and operate poorly and cheaply . They are poorly integrated and guaranteed to crash even the best maintained system . They are not supported by the software companies who refuse to provide updates for " bundled " versions . None of these applications works well - if at all - in System X or in Classic and updates are not available , despite Canon 's assurances . The thing completely fell apart after 90 days , after which it was too late for me to return the product . It 's not even deep enough to make into a cat litter box , its only real suitable purpose . Avoid it and all other Canon scanners like the plague  
1	  Stay away form Navman . Ratings as follows : Product : Rank 1 - junk - crashes often . Need PDA reboots . ( .. ) Product - want to get back to this one again - JUNK ! Plan a reboot at least once daily . Map - 1 - junk - my house is 600 + ft off the road . Actually - my house is on the wrong street . At least I am in the same state . OUtdated software on web site that rarely gets upgraded . Navman - JUNK !  
2	  This briefcase has a leather-like dark brown exterior with a suede-like interior . The whole case latches closed and the inside is divided into a small front compartment for easy access to cell phone , PDA , pens , etc . and large main compartment for documents , books , and laptop computer . Separate pouches hold accessories in front pouch and power supply / cord in main compartment . Padded , baby smooth interior and nice handle + padded shoulder strap . Like many Sony items , it may be overpriced , but it 's a well-executed products .  
1	  Apparently a replacement for the terrific 932c printer , this " upgraded " model is a bomb . Jams , can't print straight , picks up multiple sheets , and horrible service all add up to a misfire . I went through the hassle of getting two replacement units shipped to me , and both replacements had more problems than the original ! I 've written off my 940c . I don't think anyone should waste their time ( and certainly not their money ) on this one .  
2	  They sound good without going through all of the specs , but the best part is that you can wear them for hours without hurting your ears . I have had many headsets . Anywhere from 15 minutes to less than an hour , my ears hurt , and it becomes increasingly uncomfortable to wear them . I can wear these indefinitely without any discomfort . No they don't sound like a $ 200 variety , but I have paid over $ 100 and not had any better sound . I am ordering my 2nd set as a gift .  
1	  I thought Bose speakers for this price might be a bargain . Well , turned out they weren't . These speakers are not bad but definitely not worth their money . Biggest con : no bass control . Not a big problem when listening to music , sounds okay . TV and movies , however , sound kinda muffled through these speakers . Mine are going back for a refund , I 'm hooking my old ones back up ( Altec Lansing , years old , still good and better than these ) .  
2	  Este bolso de cuero para la DSC-P10 es lo mejor que puedes comprar para tu camara no solo brinda exelente proteccion sino tambien belleza . La DSC-P10 queda " como anillo al dedo " . La puedes usar con la correa al hombro o ajustarla al cinturon . Es una preciosidad de resistente cuero . Incluye un peque & ntilde ; o bolso para tus memorys sticks de repuesto y bateria . Espero sea de ayuda . ( En espa & ntilde ; ol es mejor ! )  
2	  I love , love , love this lamp ! I am using it for atop an entertainment center . With a normal lamp , we would be able to see under the lamp shade , but with this beautiful lamp that problem is eliminated ! It is beautiful and useful !  
2	  I ordered this antenna after reading the reviews here and it performs just like most of the reviews said : it pulls in all local UHF stations great by just connecting it to the TV and setting it down in back . The HD quality is great , also . It is not designed for , and does not pull in , the one local VHF digital channel that is about 19 miles away . It does get the analog signal quite well , however . To get HD , you have to either get a VHF antenna , or just wait until February 2009 for the change to all digital , when this antenna will work fine . I assume a slightly better signal would be obtained by mounting it outside , but I do not feel the need to do so yet . I am approximately 24 miles from the farthest UHF HD station , but I tried it at my office , which is another 12 miles away , and it still got an excellent SD picture just sitting behind the TV . This is a great product that does exactly what it was designed to do . The designer of this antenna , Antennas Direct , has a new version of this antenna called " Clearstream " that is a little more expensive , but looks much better if appearance is a concern .  
2	  The browser-based configuration of this unit is poorly thought-out and buggy , but once configured , it 's solid . For example , you can't skip the setup wizard and just jump to the advanced settings . And you can't set WPA via the wizard . So you have to run the wizard first , and select WEP or open mode , complete the wizard , and then go to the advanced options and set WPA . It mysteriously took many attempts before the settings were actually saved . Once I finished the configuration , the unit connected to my D-Link DWL-7100AP access point using WPA-TKIP , and has been operating for about a week now without interruption . I am using it with the XBOX Media Center Extender , and it 's been able to keep up with streaming audio and video .  
2	  I bought this printer and have had great success printing 8x10 's from scanned negatives and a 4mp digital camera . The printing speed is incredible , quality is great and ease of use can't be beat . You HAVE to use good photo paper , cheap photo paper makes things look grainy . I use ilford pearl galerie paper and cannot tell it was printed at home .  
2	  I have been using the ear phones for years . Great music and they never fall out of my ears . Great company to buy them from .  
2	  I have purchased cheaper solutions to net connections that failed terribly . This was only ( a bit ) more . It worked like a charm . I am actually connect writting this review with this item . I strongly recommend this product . I honestly don't know what the 16 bit means but , hey it works and works well .  
2	  This does everything promised .. it 's fault is a visual one . It 's very difficult to read the imprinted words above the buttons on the front panel . I made a small " cue " index card that I use to guide my choice .. sorry I know I should be able to memorize them all but just too much stuff stored at this point .  
1	  I bought this printer for use in my church .. and was it ever one bad bad mistake . Every piece of paper out of it jammed . Nothing came out of it smooth / easy - was a disaster . I did return it - got a total refund and would never again buy this particular model again . I have a HP all in one 2710 I bought about 3 years ago for my own personal use and what a great machine it has been but as is wont in the commercial world , it is no longer made - but this model printer C6180 is for the birds - or better for the trash can . I hesitated even giving it a one star - guess that would be because it was easy to get out of the box .  
1	  This product does the job it says : covers wires , however the do not say it barely holds in the wires actually used for TV 's and / or DVD players or other things . The covers are more to cover tiny , thin wires , ore just 1 . I tried to use it to cover the TV wire and the DVD player wire and it doesn't work . So DO NOT buy this if you are trying to cover more than 1 wire at a time .  
2	  Very nice . Attractive and stylish . Fits in purse , very compact . Has good clasp , well made from good leather . Places for spare chips . Not one thing I was disappointed in . not disappointed in any thing about the case . You will be pleased with this product .  
2	  I got this for my lap top that was just to hot to handle after 30 minutes or so .. this keeps my lap top cool and my online time longer :-) and you can not beat the amazon price of $ 11.99 , that 's a steal with in it self :-)  
1	  I 'm now in the process of replacing my 2nd G7 mouse . I purchased my first about two years ago and it worked fine for the first 11 months when it developed the " double-click " problem . This is where a single left mouse click actually sends a double click to your computer . From reading online , it 's a mechanical issue with the left click switch . Also from my research it appears this is a common problem with the G7s , though I 've seen it happen in other Logitech mice as well . It was still within 12 months of purchase and the RMA went very smoothly , I was extremely impressed . They shipped me a replacement with almost no questions asked . Unfortunately 14 months later , I 'm in the exact same situation as before . Left mouse button is sending double clicks . I have yet to hear back from Logitech if I 'm able to get this one replaced too , but it 's highly doubtful . Don't waste your money on a mouse that will last 1 year . On a lighter note though , this is by far the best feel of a mouse I have ever owned . I love the size and contours . There are a few extra buttons that , if you begin using them , are very handy . There are also not so many extra buttons you click them by accident . I 'm also a big fan of the rechargeable battery system , very nice . In the beginning you 'll see about 2-3 day battery life with moderate use . A year later I 'm averaging about 1-1.5 . I don't really mind though , it takes about 5s to swap them out and with setpoint installed you can have it alert you when the battery is low . All-in-all , I honestly think this is one of the best mice I 've ever used . Unfortunately it seems like the mechanical design / parts are sub-par making it a very short-lived purchase .  
1	  I bought this camera in December of 2005 for a family gift . After reading all the reviews on this and other cameras , I was very excited about having a camera that would take great pictures , per the reviews . Oh .. it does take good pictures .. but I can not get the pictures off the camera . From the very first , we had problems with the software , which is a real pain to get to work right . I transfered 4 pictures to my computer and those are the last pictures we have been able to get off the camera . We even installed the software to another computer and it still won't work . First it identifies the camera , then it says " camera can't be found " . Since the camera seems to working properly , it now appears that the USB cable is bad . I have contacted Kodak , furnished them my receipt , and requested a new cable . They advise that there is not a problem with the cable and .. get this .. the cable is NOT covered by the warranty . If I want , they will be happy to ship me another , once I pay [ .. ] . So , either I buy another cable .. which at this date is only 6 months old and never worked properly to start with .. or purchase another camera . I now have a camera that takes great pictures but does me no good . If you are thinking about buying this camera .. think long and hard . It 's not worth the money and Kodak does not stand behind their product . This is the last Kodak product I will buy .  
2	  it works fast , it works well , and it costs less than sony 's model , even with shipping costs .  
2	  Maybe the other reviewers didn't get good items , but I found this item because I was actually looking to buy another one . I got two from officedepot and they both worked fine , though I gave one to my gf who gave it to her mom , so I don't know how much that one gets used , but mine gets used almost every day . I put my songs in a 4gb usb stick and put it in random . I have to do it every time I turn it on ( it won't remember I put it in shuffle ) but it 's not the first mp3 players that I see doing this . I barely move it , so I haven't put it to any tortunre tests . The quality is fine ( though not the best ) . For the price , I overall like it . It 's still hard to find good cheap mp3 boomboxes , specially with usb port . btw .. I didn't give it 5 stars , because it 's not as smart as many other mp3 players .  
2	  Once again Linksys has made a quality product . It worked out of the box , after about 4 minutes of setup time . The instructions were dead on and it works perfectly w / my Linksys 4 Port Cable / DSL Router . I also got a Linksys PCMCIA wireless network card to use w / the WAP , and it worked perfectly too . Believe it or not , I don't work for Linksys , but I will now continue to buy their products without hesitation . If you 're a novice or networking guru , you really can't go wrong with this product . The advanced features are plentiful and some helpful , but you don't need to set them for this to work right away . Big thumbs up .  
2	  This model was OOS so I agreed to replace it with the 19 " model ( MFM HT-95 ) with a price break . My review is for that model , though I believe it 's pretty much the exact same product but just a bit smaller . This is a superb display . First it 's small , light and stable ( not easy to topple over unlike some LCD 's ) . The picture is bright and sharp , and I had no bad pixels . The built-in speakers sound reasonably good , and even emulate surround sound ( not great but an unexpected small plus ) . You can also plug in a headset for sound . This baby has all the connections you could want . Here 's how I have it configured : I have 2 PC 's connected . You just push PC1 or PC2 on the remote control ( or side buttons ) to switch . Piece of cake . I use one PC for gaming and the display is very good for it ( many LCD 's are slow and you get some ghosting , not so with this one ) . I have cable TV connected via coaxial cable , and you can either watch it full-screen through the " TV " selection , or watch it picture-in-picture while using the PC . Very , very nice feature . I also have a console game system ( gamecube ) connected to " video 2 " via S-video and composite . Many game systems just have the composite connection and that works also , but with the S-video you get a somewhat sharper image . I 'm not even using the 4th connection , but you could easily use that for a DVD player or other video source . Maybe another gaming system ? You can use this display essentially like a TV with console games , whereas you could not use your normal computer monitor unless you had a TV tuner built into it with composite or s-video connections . So if you want to use your display for PC , TV , pc gaming and console gaming , this is the product for you . I 've heard it 's been discontinued which is too bad because it 's a great product .  
1	  Replacement lamp for C & D; 4-Cell Flashlights . Great just what I want ! What this actually is , is a retrofit , consisting of a base , a collar and a different style Xenon bulb . This would be great if the lamp being replaced / upgraded was a Maglite brand flashlight . My Streamlight brand flashlight uses the Maglite bulb , but is not compatible with this retrofit ( the replacement collar is a larger diameter ) . Due to the low price of the item I had to purchase several more than I needed to meet the minimum purchase amount . Had this item been correctly listed as a retrofit kit instead of being pictured as a replacement lamp bulb , i would have continued shopping for a direct replacement . I have since found a local source for the original lamp .  
2	  I ordered my ReplayTV a few days before my parent 's Christmas visit with me . It turned out to be a great entertainment product during the holiday period and it continues to do that now . Yes , there are the occasional glitches but you have to look at this product from a software standpoint as opposed to a typical mechanical gadget . I 've already submitted my wishlist for future improvements . That 's the great thing about the product - it 's going be get a whole new update via software download in the first Quarter of 2000 . If you check ReplayTV . com you 'll see press releases on the new features coming , ( like slo-mo in both directions ! ) . All for free ! Okay , so there 's a Tivo unit for the same price and ' 30 ' hours . But I 'm sure that their ' 30 ' hour recording time produces a really crude image . And you still have to pay for their schedules ! I 'm sticking with ReplayTV . It looks like they 're going to go global soon - they 've already registered international domain names . Hope this helps ..  
2	  I was going to buy direct from Apple for $ 50 but just for the heck of it I checked Amazon and they were $ 39 with free shipping . Along with that they are excellent speakers . Hard to believe a little Ipod can put out such great sound . I highly recommend .  
2	  I have Windows XP ( which I also recommend ) and the installation process for the Linksys router was flawless . As for linking with my wirless card , XP makes it easy to change your default settings so you can avoid the problem other reviews mentioned with having a built-in ethernet card that the software defaults to . I highly recommend this product .  
2	  how hard would it be to have an " aux " position on the selector dial ? I am constantly switching back and forth from radio to iPod input and it 's a pain to have to fish around behind the unit to plug or unplug the aux . cable for the radio . I absolutely love these radios , though , and wouldn't trade them for anything . I know it wouldn't look as " slick " , but even putting the aux . jack on the front would be an improvement . Update : I agree with everyone - the new prices are absurd . I bought 2 Model 1s for $ 85 new , and an iPal for $ 120 . I would not buy any more of these at the current prices . I would lower my star rating if I could .  
1	  I 've had this camera for several years now , and never really noticed how bright the flash was . Now that I have an infant son I 'm realizing . Most of the pictures that I 've taken of him with this camera his eyes are shut ! Everyone else seems to have normal flashes . The batteries do run down quickly , and the quality 's not great which I don't mind too much . The flash is the reason I want to get rid of this camera now .  
2	  Pros : Price and sound quality . After reading some of the reviews here and on other sites my expectations were pretty low but I was pleasantly surprised at how good this system sounds . I have a hutch style computer desk so I put the Sub behind my monitor and the left / right speakers on the shelf above the monitor . The highs are clear and the Sub produces much more bass than I thought it would . Cons : There is no grill covering the downward firing Sub speaker . Not a big deal for me because I do not plan on moving it very often . Also the cables are not very long . Other Thoughts : The right speaker on my previous setup died this week after almost ten years of service . If this system lasts half as long I will happy with it . I would recommend it to anyone looking for an inexpensive speaker system for their computer .  
2	  the install depends of your hardware and s . o . i have win2k and motherboard intel so it was easy . you can use this card in many ways : i use for games and sounds very well . i download midi secuences and play midis using the soundfonts , i record it at wav format then i burn it at cd-audio and sounds very well . i play some times dvd-audio discs the output is analog no digital , ( all dvd-audio players are analog output ) ok , four stars because : Strengths : DVD-Audio , Dolby digital EX , many inputs and outputs , EAX , Remote control , support soundfonts last version . 2 games and music software , THX Certification . Weaknesses : no SACD , no DTS-ES or DTS , problems with some motherboards  
1	  This player , given the cost is dissapointing for two reason . First the resume fuction doesnt work right . It constantly will reset back to the begnning of a track , making it difficult if not impossible to listen to audiobooks . 2nd , there is no ability to fast forward ( scan ) thru mp3 tracks . Again , it ruins spoken word mp3 tracks , which is what I wanted to use most . The games are fun to play for the 1st 5 seconds . Dissapointing , I had to sell it and now am looking for something better . Its expensive too .  
1	  Did not last long .. second roll of film , the film would not catch because small plastic point broke off which pulls the film on the roll .. I threw it away .  
2	  Does everything I bought it for - runs without issue on Windows Vista and the Polar sync software I use with my S625X watch . NOTE FOR VISTA USERS : Vista won't automatically find the driver over the internet . You need to use the CD that comes with the adapter , and point it towards the folder with the Windows XP driver . After approving the driver for installation , it should work fine .  
1	  This is a nice notebook - when it works . Like many people with Toshiba laptops , this model has a problem where it shuts off when it feels like it . Sometimes it restarts , sometimes not . Within two months of having it , it had to be sent away for repair , and now , after being back for about 3 days , it is still shutting off for no reason . Research indicates there could be a cooling problem or a static problem . Toshiba is aware of these issues , and supposedly there is a lawsuit being brought against them because they refuse to address the issue . I 'm going to try to get my money back , but I 'm not hopeful .  
2	  This is a good recorder and player . I worked quite well . Amazon delivery was as good as could be expected .  
1	  I 'm sure this is a nice device , but beware that it is not compatible with the Windows 98 operating system . No Win 98 drivers are available anywhere . Only purchase this if you have a newer OS .  
2	  I 've had this printer for nearly 8 years . Although it 's an antiquated model , it 's still very functional . Pros - Prints near photo lab quality prints . ( Features HP 's PhotoRET II , HP 's technology for photo printing . ) - The 1200 x 2400 dpi resolution isn't too shabby even by today 's standards . - Grayscale and color printing is quite good but the printing of black text blew me away . Black text is sharp and heavy-weighted and almost indistinguishable from that produced by a laser printer . - Quiet operation . This printer is perfect for those late night printings . - " Generic " or " re-manufactured " ink cartridges are available and these cost a small fraction of the price of OEM HP cartridges . ( The reliability of of non-OEM cartridges is a little iffy , however ) Cons - Double-sided printing not automated . You have to manually refeed the paper back into the printer . - Expensive ink cartridges . - A little slow printing photos . ( It took about 6 minutes to print my 8 " by 10 " portrait at the highest quality ) . - Borderless printing not supported . Conclusion-The quality of the printing for documents and photos is really quite good . It 's not the speediest printer on the market , but it 's perfectly adequate for light duty printing . The major downside , which may be a deal-breaker , is that the printer does not support borderless printing . If you 're only doing document printing , the HP Deskjet 920c will fit the bill .  
1	  The mechanism that props the notebook up is not adjustable , and will not lay flat enough for MacBook / Pro notebooks to angle the display properly . The rubbery finish attracts dust and dirt like crazy , the feel of the keyboard is repulsively squishy , and the overall design of clasps / inputs is simply sub-par . For $ 70 , I was expecting a higher-end piece of hardware , not this total piece of junk . Don't buy it-it 's a gimmick .  
1	  I have had numberous back covers and most of them crack at the corners a few weeks after installation . This one is still perfect . I love the rubberized plastic feel , helps with it not sliding around on your hand . Update : Had the cover for less than a month , and one of the tabs on the side that holds it on snapped off . I am not rough with my ipad , and it does not get dropped . I take very good care of things . Now it 's useless .  
1	  I don't know what idiot designed this thing but they should get into another line of work . As the other reviewers said , it 's very difficult to program . Why they couldn't have used DIP switches like the rest of the world I 'll never know . When you have to change the batteries you have to reprogram it from scratch - not only does it not remember your settings , but the defaults are useless . By default it only leaves the light on for 1 minute , and it triggers day or night . To add insult to injury , the screws for mounting the thing are UNDER the batteries . You can't take it down , program it , and remount it because to mount it you have to take out the batteries and once the batteries are taken out it loses its programming . A bank of 8 DP switches would make this product a winner but the current design is a loser .  
1	  I bought this the end of 07 . My husband who is computer savy connected it for me . It has been nothing but problems for me . I have windows vista and that might not be helping . The software up date every day and then almost every day there is problem . It will say not connected to the computer although nothing has changed . I have restarted the computer some days it works somedays nothing . Today it will not scan telling me there is no connection yet again . Yesterday it was printing today it will not . I have had my husband look at it and he said it is impossible . The HP assistant that comes up is useless . There are times it comes up with nothing . Do yourself a favor and by something else .  
2	  The 4 feet cord is too short . But the price is cheaper than that I saw in CVS . No need to complain  
1	  I am a student and this router would not connect with the University Network . After several tries we gave up and sent it back . I am not very technologically savvy , though , so perhaps you will be able to make it work .  
2	  This camera rocks . I upgraded from my older s400 , which was also a great camera . Pros : 4x optical zoom6MP with optical image stabilizationwith a 4gb SD card , holds 1300 + images or 35 + minutes of 640x480x30fps video ( whoot ! ) FAST when viewing pictures and when taking pictures . Love that DIGIC II processor . top-notch build qualitysmaller than my older sd400Improvement opportunities : Lose the optical viewfinder , use a 3 " lcd . Allow optical zoom during video  
1	  In general , I really like Sony products , and I started out really liking these a few years ago . I have three pairs now , and the two newest pairs have started the wire-shredding thing you 've probably read about . The oldest and most-used pair has a more " plasticy " feel to the wires , whereas the newer ones are rubbery and stretchy , and will continue to deteriorate over time . This is a well-known issue with these lately , so if you can get ones with the plasticy wires , you should be in great shape . BUT , once you 've tried high-end in-ear-monitors ( IEMs ) like Ultimate Ears or Shure , you 'll do what I did and give these away or sell ' em outright . Would have been 4 stars without the recent quality issue . Pros : Decent sound . Although you can do better in this price range with Sennheiser , Panasonic , or Creative , these are by no means " horrible " . A definite HUGE step up from whatever lousy free ' buds you may have gotten with your player . STRONG bass , lots of treble . Cute carrying case , nice to have different size tips to use to get the fit right . They don't protrude from your ears , so you can probably sleep in them if you want to . If you buy them , buy ' em here . Cons : Durabilty , durability , and durability . I 'm personally going to avoid these for a while until Sony gets the wire issue sorted out . Bass , while strong , is not detailed or controlled . Treble , while definitely there , is subject to painful sibilance at higher levels . Cute little case will fall apart quickly . Bottom line : Formerly a good product for the price , but you should try to find something else if you haven't already been stuck with these .  
1	  I usually get pretty good products from amazon . But this time I am in bad luck . There is obviously something wrong of this product - I can't turn it on after taking it for a test drive after one hour . I thought it was because the battery was low . As I was unwrapping the cable in the car to charge the battery , something fell off . I looked closer , the tip of the cable was broken ! I was on a small street of SF , and I had no sense of direction . Boy , it took me long time to figure out how to get out of there without GPS as I could not turn on the thing . I was not happy about that . It was good that amazon refunded the money to me , but I still have to pay a shipping fee of $ 18.00 which is not refunded . Lesson learned : always test your product thoroughly within 30 days of purchase .  
1	  Trust me when I tell you that this POS will break within a year ( broken buttons , battery not charging , etc . ) Just google the numerous user complaints . After your warranty is up , the only " fix " Logitech will offer you is to buy a REPLACEMENT remote , which only carries a 30-day warranty , at 50 % discount . It 's not a coincidence that the warranty period is so short . So don't think you 're buying this remote to own and use for more than a year . You 're merely RENTING it , because it WILL break in a year , I guarantee it .  
1	  Output flows over into the input tray , which then jams . The paper holder on the outputbin broke on its cheap stems within days . After less than 5,000 pages of life now the feed jams every time . Toner is as expensive as the printer , and absolutely does NOT last as long as advertised . A ripoff in every possible way .  
1	  I picked up a couple Coby DP-151 1.5 " Digital Photo Keychains . I didn't expect much for the price but this item is unfit to be sold . Coby should be lucky if someone doesn't file a class action suit over this unusable item . The software doesn't recognize the device . I used both the Mac and Windows versions of the software with two different Coby keychains . Also , the version 1.02 software that ships with the device is different from the version 1.02 software provided on the Coby website . How many different versions of 1.02 software do they have ? Regardless , none of them work .  
1	  Don't waste your time . I bought this and the first one I recieved was broken . Amazon promptly replaced it . But it came with the housing cracked . Sound was muffled and crackleing . Replaced it with a BIC lets see how that turns out .  
2	  The Palm m100 is a great handheald . I would recommend it to anyone looking to buy something that can really help them keep organized . You can use it as an assignment book for school , and it is also great for games . There are thousands of games , free and purchasable , on the internet which you can download and install into the palm . Of course , it would be better if it had a little more memory , because with only 2mb , you cannot have all the programs you want installed at one time .  
2	  Best photos I 've taken in a while , the flash is adjustable and I love it  
2	  The best at this price . Like the color and functions . Mine has latest longer than some comparable higher end models . Life saver when trying to keep a busy life organized . Great optional backlight feature .  
1	  After spending about an hour configuring this remote , to replace two of my other remotes , I was not able to set up ANY of its functionality to make me want to pick it up . The simple activities I tried didnt work at all ( the help button failed to learn anything ) , so I set up the controls by device . After getting all the buttons nicely mapped , I realized I 'd rather just pick up my other dedicated remotes ( which already have perfect button mappings ! ) than to press a minimum of 3 buttons to switch device and do something using the Harmony 550 .  
1	  I used an HDMI cable to hook up the Philips DVP5900 DVD player to my brand new Philips 42 " widescreen plasma TV . Unbelievably a bright green stripe appears down the right side of the display on the TV regardless of what DVD I play . The stripe varies from as much as half an inch in width to almost nothing . I thought the issue was possibly related to the player simply warming up , but I 've had it on for three hours , and while the stripe starts out wide , and then shrinks to almost nothing at times , it does come back . I can't enjoy a picture which has a bright green stripe of varying width coming and going along the right side of the display . I 've e-mailed Philips twice regarding the issue and received no response , and the problem is not mentioned on their online support page . I checked the available firmware upgrade online too , and there is no mention of the issue or any fix for it . I saw another review where the user refers to a green bar , so apparently it 's not just my player-though it probably is related to the HDMI hookup and the use of a widescreen TV ( i.e. , you might not experience the problem with different equipment and a different connection-I just don't know ) . While I 'm here I 'd like to suggest strongly to Philips that if they 're going to sell their wares in the US market they rewrite their manuals and online support documents in comprehensible business English , dispensing of the mangled grammar , misspelled and missing words that tend to make it hard to figure out what 's meant at times . I 'm returning the player to Amazon , and apologize to them for wasting their time on this one . I 'd suggest they consider not selling this player unless there 's a resolution of this issue . CORRECTION , as of 2/6/06 : I wrote an updated review , but the system wouldn't allow me to enter a second review of the same product , only to edit this original review , so I 've added the update below : I wrote the earlier 1/14/06 review suggesting this DVD player was possibly faulty because of the bright green stripe that appeared down the right side of the display on my plasma HDTV . Since then I 've replaced the player with a highly rated Sony HDMI player .. and the green stripe has appeared again , though only about half the width-perhaps a quarter of an inch wide . So the fault must be with the TV and not the DVD player . I 've checked the Philips online support documents for the TV , and there is a document that mentions the picture can be off-center when using an HDMI connection , though it doesn't refer to any green stripe on the right side . What I 've found out in the meantime is that the TV 's picture format can be set to a fixed widescreen display when using a DVD , instead of the default automatic format , which will stretch the picture to fit the screen , and is useful when watching TV . The other night I watched the entirety of National Treasure ( a film I can highly recommend ) with the TV itself set to the widescreen format , and there was no issue with any green stripe . ( The National Treasure DVD was also in the widescreen format by the way-it was not the full screen version . ) My apologies for the earlier review , but then it would have helped if Philips had responded to my questions or had online support that addressed the issue . I don't think the Philips DVD picture quality was that different from what I 've seen with this new Sony player , so this Philips player might work for you .  
1	  The Hot Link Pro was not compatible with the Motorola VIP 1225 HD DVR that was recently installed by ATT Uverse . It seemed to control everything else just fine , but there was absolutely no response from the VIP 1225 . That leads me to believe that Hot Link Pro can't reproduce a high enough frequency signal or something . I 'm familiar with interference and saturation in IR systems , but with those problems you usually see SOME response . In those cases the device responds a little ( maybe the wrong thing happens , or something only happens intermittently ) , but in this case , the device didn't respond ever while all other devices were working fine .  
2	  I purchased this keyboard about 5 years ago from Amazon . It has stood the test of time and the battery still works great . The little mini mouse pad is kind of useless , but the keyboard is great . It is very slim and sleek on my desk . The charging stand really makes this a nice addition to the office , because I can put in on the stand out of the way to use the desk space .  
2	  I was first thinking about this lens a year ago . I had seen some great results on different forums but ended up not buying it . I bought a teleconverter instead for my existing lens . Now a year later after being disappointed with the teleconverter I decided to go ahead and buy the Bigma . What a difference . The images are sharp , there is no CA , edge sharpness is good . Yes , it is a little heavy and not the fastest 50mm lens out there , but who buys a 50-500 zoom for the short end anyway ? I took it out to a local lake and got some great shots of Osprey , Red-tailed Hawks , and Herons . None of these would have been possible without the Bigma . All shots were taken hand-held . The Bigma on my K10D with shake reduction work well together . I took a few test shots handheld down to 1/60th , while not crystal sharp there were still far superior to anything I could have gotten with the teleconverter on a tripod . All in all I highly recommend this lens .  
1	  When I first bought this , DVDs would freeze at times and the image would decay to pixels at times . I contacted Sony customer service and they said that it was due to finger prints or scratches on the DVDs . After I had the machine for about 2 to 3 months , the DVD player stopped reading DVDs completely . I again contacted customer service and they told me to ship it to Texas and that they would send me a refurbished machine for ninety dollars . Actually , ninety was the minimum cost for labor since the warranty only covered parts . It could cost more if any of the parts were not covered by the warranty . Considering the cost of the machine , this was not a good option . I am stuck , but I hope that others won't make the same mistake and buy this machine . Also , after I ran into problems , I looked on Amazon for reviews of similar Sony DVD players . Sure enough , others had the same problem .  
2	  I got this keyboard & mouse combo from HP with a PC I bought . Used it for about a year and I have no complaints . It has a nice feel to the keyboard , responsive and just the right resistance to the pressure . The mouse is also excellent and I 've had no complaints so far . My son complained that it became unresponsive after moving about 5 -6 feet away , so maybe those complaints are justified . A USB extension cord should remedy that though , but then you have a cord again ! Pluging the USB receiver into a front USB port should also extend the range .  
1	  must be 20 words long ? how about this : this is the worst keyboard I 've ever purchased . I was skeptical about the keyboard , but I gave it a chance , and I got burned . Will never purchase any hardware from M $ again .  
2	  This silicon case comes in colors and will change the look of your iPod nano . Blue , Clear , Green , Pink , and Purple . It gives color to your nano so that it won't be black or white anymore . You can dress them up based on your mood today with 5 different colors . It will also protect your iPod from scratches and prevents it from sliding on a tilted table or slipped out of your pocket when you 're sitting . The silicon case ' grip ' it well .  
1	  Total crap for paper craft . not strong enough at all , very high water content . stay away - this is not a glue pen - this is a glue stick .  
2	  the product is a very good product . it was delivered in a timely manner . would buy another . i have had no problems with this purchase . i would reccomend this to a friend .  
1	  The Epson Stylus CX7000F Series was a freebie when I purchased a Toshiba laptop . After owning it for 2 years , I now understand why it was a free accessory . I rarely print , but the ink cartridges regulary run out of ink and require replacement . Further , when I am printing black and white documents , I can't print if a color cartridge is depleted . I must first replace the cyan , magenta , and / or yellow ink cartridge-whichever one runs out of ink first . As of today , I 'm shopping for a new laserjet printer , and it won't be an Epson printer !  
2	  I 'll admit , it had to grow on me a bit , and I had to learn that this is NOT a perfect substitute for a regular digital camera , since it has no flash . That being said , it IS an amazing camera considering it 's lack of size-once you learn how to take pictures with it , and give it adequate light , it is possible to get some great results out of it . Low light pictures can be VERY grainy , so it definately isn't a good low-light camera . Do a web search for " eyemodule2 pictures " like I did , to see what " real people " are doing with the eyemodule2 . It isn't a megapixel camera , but then again , they don't get much smaller than this !  
1	  Of the 10-ish UPSes I 've bought in my ( short ) life , this is the worst . After just a couple months of life , the power went out , and the UPS lasted about 2 minutes . Now , after 3 years , it lasts 1 . I just ordered an APC700 . My 7-year old APC , just this evening , lasted 6 minutes before the power came back on , but the Belkin was dead in about 1 , and the pcs are pretty much identical . Can't recommend this one in good faith .  
1	  I 've been using one of these for the past year or so , and really need to warn people away from them . It 's nice and cheap , and it looks great and has a great user interface through its web UI - but it has a serious bug . Heavy internet use will cause it to crash - it won't even respond to pings from the LAN . To fix this requires a manual power cycle . This really bit me badly last weekend , when I was on the road and needed to log into my home machine via ssh - the MR814 had crashed and the internet connection was down as a result . It 's a real shame , as in most other respects , it 's a perfectly good product . But the reliability problems are just too serious .  
1	  i have bought 2 pairs of these in the last year . they have both quit working because of loose wires and i keep getting the runaround from the company about the warranty . DO NOT GIVE ANY MONEY TO THESE PEOPLE . they dont back up what they say and they are of terrible quality in the workmanship department . i cant complain about the sound though .  
1	  I purchased this drive in March of 2005 . It just failed as the above users drives failed ( March 2006 ) . However , this has a happy ending and my fingers are still crossed . It was still under warrenty so i went to the Seagate site and to my amazement I was able to pay 24.95USD and they preshipped me a replacement in two days with a Call tag . I was able to salvage my old files and slowly copy them to the NEW 400 gig replacement ! 100 extra gigs . Its a totally new model too . So I have my fingers crossed .. I am shipping the old one back today ! YEAH ! So try this .. You can see if your drive is under warranty online at Seagate . com and start the RMA process right away . Good Luck ..  
1	  I put in a set of batteries to charge and expected them to be charged " Quickly . " I kept looking for the green light to come on indicating that the batteries were fully charged but it didn't . So , I left it on overnight and the batteries never did fully charge . I sent it back for a refund . I 'm sure it was just a factory defect but I didn't want to go through the ordering , shipping , and try it out process again and take another chance that another one might have the same problem and have to return it again .  
2	  I brought my family into the digital photography realm with DX 7630 as holiday 2005 gifts . 3 total . The technology curve was minimal - my admittedly non tech Dad ( email is a challenge ) was taking photos in no time and loving that he could delete or save on the fly without ' wasting film ' . My Mom and I walked through the software and had photos of the grandchild printing out in both wallet size and 4 x 6 from the Easy Share printer before the day was out . The next week my brothers were sending photos via email and chatting about ' did you know this camera can also do video ' .. We have had one plastic battery lock snap , and my Mom said that Kodak customer service took immediate responsibility and that the camera is being shipped back to them this week - approximately a 10 - 14 day turn around , which was acceptable .  
2	  I spent many hours researching online & looking in the stores . This picture to me was the best bang for the buck . Less than $ 1900 shipped to my door , I found the stand online for under $ 200 & it really does add to the appearance of the setup . I am blown away by sporting events on HD . The HDMI input for my Toshiba dvd player is sweet . The picture is stunning . My neighbor has Plasma at more than twice the costs & now he wants mine . The split screen is a nice feature if you have children . I have read about many problems with the cablecard but my experience has been the problems lie with the cable companies themselves , Comcast has told me they are having compatibility issues . The memory card reader is another nice feature although I dont know whether it is the card / camera I am using or the TV that makes the pictures look a little grainy . There have been grumblings of Lamp issues with this TV but way too soon for me to comment on that { had mine for 2 months } . I find the lower setting on the brightness of the lamp looks almost as good as the higher setting esp . at night . The lower setting should add another 2000 hours to the life of the lamp . Even if the lamp does go the cost { $ 350 } is much cheaper than maintainence on a Plasma or LCD . You cannot go wrong with the TV . I highly recommend .  
1	  This otherwise excellent product has one major deficiency . You can not order the tracks using the MP3 track number . You can only order tracks alphabetically , randomly , or with a playlist . I own a number of CDs such as musicals that must be played in the original track order which is part of the MP3 file tag information . Can you image watching the scenes of a DVD movie only in random or alphabetical order ? Why should I be forced to create a playlist or hack up the filename just to force this product to play the tracks in the correct order when the information necessary to do so is already in the MP3 file ? ..  
1	  The Netgear SC101 was one of the worst possible choices . Propriatary format and software are bad news please spend your money on something else .  
1	  Like many other readers , I felt there were too many unanswered questions . The ending was silly .  
2	  This tuner was a great value through Amazon . We just bought a Samsung 4665F LCD TV & was looking to also upgrade my 15yr . Sony tuner with a contemporary 5.1 channel AV receiver . I ended up purchasing the Pioneer VSX-1016TXV 7.1 channel rec . for only $ 419 thru Amazon . Given the power & features on this unit , I would 've expected to pay $ 600 + at least . * Important note ! Most 7.1 rec . are longer than your older rec . / tuners . I had to modify the back of our new entertainment center to ensure the front on this unit would be flushed with the front of the entertainment center .  
2	  Got it , put batteries in , put in codes , and it worked . Even for my old TV . But . . . don't throw away the code list . I tossed mine and now can't find codes for my new DVD player ( planning on calling Philips , don't foresee an issue . )  
1	  I received tv for a great price from Amazon and had no trouble with the shipping . TV picture quality was awesome , immediately loved the tv . Had tv for approximately a week and then on vacation for two weeks . Came back and watched off and on for another couple of weeks , then picture went real white . Called Amazon but it was past thirty day return policy . Called Samsung and got the run around for a week and a half about getting it repaired . The first place they told us to call to get it fixed the guy just laughed and said he didn't want to touch it . Finally , found a local repair shop and the guy there said he had never heard of a problem like the one we are experiencing . Been with out tv for going on three weeks . Not sure about quality or quality of service .  
1	  I love SIRUS and the S50 is great when it works but has so many problems . The system is very dependent on software . The upgrades fix one problem and but create a new problem . In particular , since the 3.15 software update , just about every unit it was downloaded to has got the dreded " No Signal " problem . Technical supoort says nothing can be done until the next firmware update in 2 months - I would recommend no one buy for 2 months until the problem is fixed .  
1	  TigerDirect does not ship a " Cables to Go " brand product , but rather a cheap knock-off . Do not buy from this merchant .  
1	  i have a creek right behind my 1 1/2 acres and we have always had bug issues . i got the stinger at bjs , worked great the first day and thats it ! it wouldn't come on the second day , i just returned it and i 'm getting a flowtron instead .. i 'll see if that lives up to the glowing reviews .  
1	  The price was great and that is exactly why I bought it . But , I got just what I paid for ! It worked great for the first 2 weeks and then it was downhill from there . The volume turns down on it 's own ! I would lose all of the music on the player for no reason and finally the thing just died after about a month . The company was great and gave me a new player to replace the original piece of crap I bought . They didn't give me a hard time or didn't question me at all . I was very pleased with that . I still have the replacement and it 's been at least a year . It works good except for I don't get sound into both ear pieces of my headphones unless I push the headphone slot to the side and it works . Anyways , this product is not worth the money . spend a little more money and get a good product .  
1	  After reading everyone 's glowing reviews of this alarm clock , we got it for our bedroom . We like the CD playing , and a lot of the features it does offer which many , many other reviews cover . The BIG negative that I have not seen referenced here : Only after purchasing and using it did we find out that the clock proudly and loudly confirms your alarm reset for tomorrow with a LOUD beep . Which wakes me up every morning when my husband gets up to go the gym at 5:30 . It 's ironic that there is a " gentle wake " alarm on this clock , where it starts out very soft and the volume slowly and continually rises to gently wake you , but then there is no way to reset your alarm each morning without hearing the jarringly annoying beep . It would be great if you could disable this feature , or , even better , the clock would allow you to see some sort of icon instead of hearing an annoying sound . Hopefully this is something that will be corrected for future editions of this clock . I would have purchased a different alarm clock with less features had I known about this stupid noise , it 's THAT annoying . For those of you sharing a room and getting up at different times , I 'd avoid this one and look for something that is a bit friendlier to the person sleeping in later each morning .  
2	  I have used this camera a few times and love it . It is easy to use and the pictures are great .  
2	  I 'm able to level the camera both vertical and horizontally . I 'm able to lock it in place . I have no concerns with this head .  
1	  I have had my mouse for about 8 months and it is broken . The " L " shaped design for the thing you hook to the computer is the problem . I will call it a receiver . It you stow the receiver too many times into the mouse it starts to break . Over time the receiver doesn't receive . I would not recommend this product . It 's better to have a straight receiver .  
1	  after testing my disc it seems to make my pics over saturated with a bit of blue while using the grey card my pics seemed truer to correct color maybe I just got A bad copy ?  
2	  * Updated , since we 've gone another year of heavy usage with this TV , and it 's still as good as the day we bought it . We leave it on in the evenings , whether or not we 're watching it ( I like the background noise , and news ) , so we 're probably going on 5,000 hours . For those of you who have had the " popping " problem , it would help the rest of us owners ( whose TVs are still fine after well over 2 years ) to know :( a ) What was the manufacture date of your TV ? ( b ) When did you buy the TV ? ( c ) What time of year ( month / season ) did it " pop " ? ( d ) What is your setup ? Wall-mount ? Stand ? ( e ) Is the area behind the TV well ventilated ? * The previous few questions are only because plasma TVs use a lot of power , and of course will run hot ( just feel the back after a couple hours ) . One of the number 1 rules to owning a plasma is to use it in a VERY well ventilated area . ( f ) What were your TV settings most of the time ? Brightness / Contrast ? Low / Regular power ? Did you lower the settings for the first 200 hours as recommended for all plasmas ? ( g ) How many hours a day did you typically run the TV ? I only suggest that people update their reviews with more info , because it might make a difference as to how the owners of working sets continue with their current setup . If it turns out many of the " poppers " were hung on the wall in a room with no venilation behind it , or right up against a wall , or anywhere near a heater / vent , or left on for several hours at a time - that 's going to make a huge difference , and it might help others preserve their TVs , saving from the same outcome . The average owner might not be aware of the proper care and setup of their plasma , which could lead to some ( of course not all ) of the unhappy buyers of this TV . Just a thought . Even if it dies , we had some good times .  
1	  bought this for christmas . Did all the loading of all my systems . It worked for about 10 minutes then the screen froze and I could'nt do anything . Called logitech directly and they walked me through a couple of things to do to try to fix it . NOTHING WORKED . Returned it to amazon for a replacement thinking maybe I received a bad one . Instead I received a refund and now the price it alot higher so of course I will not be purchased it .  
2	  Cannot beat the price . Excellent lens for the price . Was very interested to buy 1.4g but due the price bought the 1.8d and am very happy with the performance .  
1	  I spend days with Intel customer support to get my new cam working on Win98 . I had to replace dlls and systems files ! I addition I had to install some more files manually . It worked ! and it was pretty good . Than I upgraded to win2k and also put the new drives provided .. The cam is in the dust now . I don't have the time and the nerves to spend another week with Intel on the phone and on top of it pay them for that once more . Try something else .  
1	  I had seen a review for a similar item in which the customer had warned that he received a single pack after having ordered from Amazon and having paid for a multi-pack . I 've never had any difficulty with Amazon so I was a little surpised when the same thing happened to me . I immediately reported the mistake to Amazon , via e-mail . The reply , which was very prompt , stated that they had checked the website and had " found that ' Rhinotek 's Canon BCI-24 - Compatible Black Ink Cartridge 4-Pack ( BCI-24B-R4 ) ' comes with one Cartridge with 4 Ink tanks . " Although I clearly understand that this misunderstanding is based on the unclear language in this listing , particularly the way in which " cartridge " and " tank " are used interchangeably , nowhere does it state that it " comes with one Cartridge with 4 Ink tanks . " What it does say is that a " pack includes 4 black ink tanks . " Not only did the person that replied to my e-mail state that I had actually received the right product , but when I called Amazon 's 800-number another Amazon employee made the same argument . I had to bring her attention to the model number listed for the single cartridge ( BCI-24B-R ) , which matched the model number printed on the bottom of the item I received , before she would even consider conceding . ( The item I had ordered , the 4-pack , has the model number BCI-24B-R4 ) I am thoroughly frustrated over this interaction , the time spent more than outweighing any savings , that I am certain that I will never purchase any such items from Amazon again ; I 'd rather go to the local office supply store and spend a few extra bucks to escape the chance of any further frustration . At this point , I am not sure if I will ever use Amazon again .  
1	  I 've had the unit for about a year now , but only paid about $ 50 for it . About six months ago it developed a volume problem . When the unit is first turned it goes to full volume . It will also sometimes turn on all by itself , at full volume , durring a thunderstorm . The sound quality is pretty good though , especially for the price . I like bass , but find the iVoice a little too bass heavy . I usually wind up using the bass reducer function on my iPod . I would have given it 4.5 stars if not for the volume issue .  
1	  The sound quality is not bad , but the cord is ALWAYS tangled . VERY annoying . Don't buy these .  
1	  I cant believe its taken me this long to hunt for a new router . My old linksys seemed to be flaky and I picked up one of these on the cheap . I 've a 1.3 " drilled a hole in the lid and screwed ridiculously loud server fan attached to a variable voltage wall wart , even at full juice this dies in the middle of file transfers . I 've also put heatsinks on the three ic chips that get hot inside the unit ( yes i have that much time ) .. it 's still garbage . Its not heat , so it must be awful firmware or crap manufacturing . Save your time and money and pass on this router .  
2	  Packed in a very small package , but it comes with a useful tiny case for the remote so it works very well .  
2	  10/18/2008 I read all the reviews before I bought this router and was a little sceptical about its claims . Within 20 minutes of its arrival it was up and running in both LAN and WLAN . First thing to do is check for updated software / hardware updates from TrendNet . Even though I received the latest version of this router I found I needed both . Flashing the router went real smooth as did software installation . Configuring was a bit tougher as even with the new software the configuration utility would not show up . I know networking so I knew how to bring it up and customize it for my purposes . GREAT RANGE My neighbor two doors down can log in and he gets a better signal strength from me than he does his own linksys . Probably wouldn't recommend for a novice user but anyone with a little good experience should have no problems . I still haven't had the signal loss some people have complained about nor the near use drops in WLAN . Nice compact size with adjustable wireless signal strenth is great . I am pretty happy with the purchase and hope you will be to .  
1	  Do NOT buy this one , you can't hear ANYTHING but static with it . My suggustion , go with the Fisher Price ( Lights and Sounds ) . We bought the Safe Glow monitor when we had our second baby ( so the two monitors would look different and you could tell who was crying ) , and we hear nothing but static from it . Maybe I 'm spoiled from the clarity of the Fisher Price one we already had , but I have adjusted this one so many times and it makes no difference .. it 's useless . Sorry to sound so harsh , I just don't want you to be as dissappointed as we have been with ours .  
2	  I have owned this keyboard for several years now and use it with my HTPC . It is a great keyboard that works very well from all positions in the room and from all angles . Recently I purchased a new HTPC with Media Center and decided to order the MS Media Center Edition remote keyboard . It was a terrible disappointment after using the Adesso . The IR connection is horrible after being accustomed to the 2.4ghz RF controller that the Adesso uses . And the pointer device was almost useless . Never buy a remote keyboard without a touchpad ! I 've just found that Adesso is making a new model with MCE functionality so I think one of those is going to be my next purchase .  
2	  i wanted a protective cover for my widescreen laptop . it was hard finding one big enough without having to buy a huge messenger bag . this fits the Dell 17 & # 34 ; screen , which meassures about 16 & # 34 ; wide . inside , this sleeve has protective bubbles which is very nice !  
2	  If you are controlling multiple components this is a MUST have . The system I am controling with my Harmony 360 consists of the following : TV , Sattellite Tuner , DVD / CD , AV Reciever and Xbox 360 . I previously tried the Radio Shack Kameleon universal remote . Let me say their is NO comparison . The Logitech Harmony 360 remote took the Kameleon behind the ' wood shed ' and kicked it 's proverbial butt ! The Harmony was very easy to program . Just have a list of the components you plan on controling with the remote along with their Manufacturer and Model information . The setup software easily walks you through the process . The ' Activities ' is the best part about this remote . Via the setup software you can define activities such as , ' Watch TV ' or ' Watch DVD ' and you answer a series of questions about which equipment is needed for the activity and what the settings on the equipment must be at for the activity . Once you 've completed entering the component information and defining your activities the end configuration is downloaded to your remote via a USB cable . Slick . The Harmony maybe took 30 minutes to an hour max to gather the information I needed and program the remote and test it . I literally probably spent a minimum of 4 hours programming that Kameleon and it still was very cumbersome to use . My wife couldn't use it and most of the time it was just simpler to return to using the 4 original manufacturer remotes ! Since getting the Harmony I have not touched those manufacture remotes , not even once and my wife can use the system without help . The bottom line is , this remote is a great purchase if you have a typical AV system in today 's homes ( tv , dvd , stereo ) . Even with a near $ 100 price tag you won't be disappointed . Enjoy ! I know you will .  
2	  I have to wonder whether some of the people posting negative reviews are actually using these properly . It 's a bit of a pain getting them inserted properly , what with one piece that has to go fully into the ear and another that goes over . If you just sort of hang them over your ear of course the sound quality is going to be awful , but if they 're in properly the sound seems totally acceptable - comparable to either my AKG or Sennheiser earmuffs , for example . Are you going to be able to crank up the volume all the way and feel your teeth rattle ? Of course not ! At reasonable and even fairly high volumes , though , the fidelity including bass is just fine . These beat the stuffing out of the Sony EX51s I reviewed last , which truly were junk for twice the price .  
2	  It sucks :-) Actually , for a suction cup this should be a compliment . Apart from that it works just fine , as most stuff from Garmin does ( after they managed to improve the rubber part ) .  
2	  The lower magnification setting is crystal clear . The higher magnification is a bit bouncy and is easily impacted by mirage . It also tends to represent white backgrounds with a slightly blue tint at the higher magnifications . All considered , I would recommend it anyone wanting to spend under $ 500 for a spotting scope .  
1	  After just under 3 months of use , it is not working . Although I liked the fact that I could plug in an extra device , I was afraid of using it . Yesterday I used it for the first time to charge my iPod at the same time I was listening to it . This morning when I went to use it again , it just did not work at all . I guess my gut feeling was right . To be fair , the quality of the sound was very good , and up until this morning I was very happy with it . If you still want to buy this product , just make sure you don't plug any additional device to it .  
2	  I bought this Recorder on Amazon for $ 19.99 and have never had any problems with it . The recordings are extremely audible in SP mode and I especially appreciate the noise filter switch which filters out background noises . You can't go wrong with this one .  
1	  I spent many hours tring to connect my computer to the wirless router . I could not figure it out . Electronic cards going bad was the last thing I would suspect but I was not correct . The Card 1024 was my problem and I don't recommend buying one . I know electonics and this card failed me where other have not .  
2	  Excellent product to help student learn accountancy in the business administration bachelor program .  
1	  Ordered this from uk & to be honest it was delevered very quickly , but like other people have stated as soon as you removed the backing film it instantly attracted every dust partical in the local area , luckly I had some anti static spray left over from putting a new screen protector on my phone so managed to solve the problem , eventually . As for the matt finish all I can say is it makes a great fingerprint enhancer as even after reading a couple of chapters of a book when any light hits it , its a mess . You will get a lot of use out of the free cleaning cloth !  
1	  This item works well for playing , but the charger does not work . I get an error message on both Ipods .  
1	  I bought a B + W KSM Polarized Circular filter and threaded to the B + W UV filter and couldn't get them apart . In addition , the UV filter wouldn't properly thread to my new Canon 18-135mm EFS lens .  
1	  I found that the censors don't last more than 2 times out . Can get expensive at $ 24.99 a pop .  
1	  Despite the description stating that this remote is used for Nikon DSLR cameras , this remote does NOT work with the Nikon D3100 camera model .  
1	  This purchase was an absolute waste of money . I threw out the packing material before I realized what an inferior product I had purchased . The batteries hold little charger . The charger broke after 3 uses . Complete was of $ . The camera itself is a jewel . The charger is absolute junk .  
1	  I 'm a fairly saavy computer user and was unable to get this range extender to work . After a three hour conversation with customer service ( read : India ) , they told me they were unable to help . Also , they candidly admitted that the product has shortcomings and they cannot guarantee correct functionality when WEP is enabled . Unless your name is Bill Gates or you have A LOT of spare time to waste , do not consider buying this product . Really .  
1	  The router 's firmware corupted after two weeks of use . I bought it for [ $ ] and found the firewall features not worth the money . When the firmware corrupted , linksys tech support said a lot of umms and ahhs and told me to take it back . My cat provided better support and seemed to have a higher technical background . I bought a D-link router that came with a print server for [ $ ] 60 bucks . It doesn't have a switch but for my uses I don't need one . My friend bought a linksys router and has returned his as the firmware corrupted shortly after he bought it . Buy a D-Link and buy a four port switch and you will be way better off than buying this cheesey little router . :)  
1	  Very impressed with the video , Totally disappointed with the microphone . Am going to return it and try to locate a logitech .  
2	  The Sony WM-FX197 is a top quality product . I love the mega-bass and the reception is very clear for the radio . The cassette part works perfectly . Cassettes that i have not been able to listen to for years i can now listen to again because of this product .  
1	  I bought this printer / fax / scanner when I started business school as I wanted an all-in-one machine . Based on past experience , I only wanted an HP , so this was the model for me , so I thought .. The setup was a complete hassle and required hours on the phone with HP customer service ( at my own expense as they don't have a toll-free number . It turned out that the drivers that came on the CD-ROM in the box were outdated and would not work with Windows 2000 . Further , since I had already installed them , there was no easy way to un-install them . A month after having the printer , HP still blames the problem on Microsoft ( isn't this item supposed to be designed for Windows ? ) . Although I can now print and fax , I have still not been able to use the scan feature . Further , I can't return the product to the store any longer . In summary , I am extremely disappointed in the product and would recommend taking a look at models by other manufacturers . But , if you don't take my advice , when you are on the phone with HP will you ask them to return my calls regarding complaint number 1428487861 ? The print quality  
1	  Logitech Quickcam for Notebooks ProPlease do not buy this product , its an utter useless product , it only works for prior versions of windows 7 only like XP & Vista .  
2	  The quality of the pictures is great . But you need to remember to enhance details on the settings when you print , while this will take on more ink , that is ok , the quality is perfect . Colors are bright and exact , while printing RGB format . It feels like the pictures are clone from the screen . I recomend this product to anybody that needs to create their own family album and not wait until the store developers have it ready . Also for postcards and invitations , where you dont want large quantities .  
2	  I bought my router about 6 months ago . I installed it in minutes and it 's worked flawlessly since then . I have my house wired with four RJ45 ports strategically located in different rooms , all connected to the ports of the Linksys . Two are in use and the other two can be used by my laptop . I have a couple more computers that are connected directly to the Linksys in my server room . The worst thing that 's happened is that I had to reset it once when the power to my house went out . My only complaint is that it cannot handle an inbound VPN ( I 'd like to set up an FTP or web server on one of my machines just to store personal information that I could access from different locations ) . But that 's a relatively small issue . If you ask me , the BEFSR41 is good , cheap and fast .  
1	  I tried to update the maps , and COBRA is charging $ 129 ! I could buy a newer unit and get current maps and more features . COBRA just stonewalled , and said this model was discontinued several years ago , and they would only update the maps for the $ 129 . The maps that are on the model are more than several years old . If this is how they treat their consumers , I will never buy another Cobra product again !  
1	  Vendor claimed they would no longer provide this item through Amazon because of numerous difficulties . It was a shame because they were the cheapest source of these projection lamps I was able to find .  
1	  Well .. I 'll just say that I have had better experiences with new computers . I like the form factor and the cool yellow color but Ubuntu is simply a pain in the neck . I can understand that some Linux enthusists might like twiddling with Ubuntu , but I don't . I sent it back and ordered something else . The camera was flaky and wireless is a hassle on any variant of Linux . When I buy a new computer , I want something that works out of the box , not a science project . I ended up going with the Asus Eee with XP - and it is everything I wanted and more . I bought a second Eee for my sister in law and she is equally delighted .  
2	  Just bought this MP3 player for my son for his 7th birthday . His older sister has the 1 GB model . He loves it and holds more than enough songs for him , considering his age . Easy , never asks how to do anything and keeps him busy for any car trips . I guess the only complaint I would have is the singing we hear coming from the backseat !  
1	  I ordered 2 of these months ago as was promised the items in December . I just received another delay notice . I 'm sorry I already purchased the cameras , doc & cards or I would return the entire thing and take my business somewhere else .  
2	  I 'm not positive what the dry carbon cleaning system is but these have been keeping my lens clear of anything for the last few weeks . These do work .  
1	  Product is fine , but why purchase from a seller that charges exhorbitant prices for individual shippin ? !  
2	  Great Buy . Received item before estimated time . Easy to use . If you are looking for a wire cable for you ipod ipod this is it .  
1	  It has a iPod dock , but the iPod can not be used unless you computer are connected ; It has a speaker with a subwoofer , but the sound quality is of such inferior quality , it is worse than any $ 10 speaker you can get in the market ; It 's image quality of among the average , not as sharp as NEC or SamsungIt simply make no sense to buy such a thing at a price $ 200 higher tahn its competitor , without a single feature impressive , and worth the investment .  
2	  I wanted a camera that was not as heavy as the D200 or D300 . I am very happy with the D40 . The lens is a pretty good also . Together they are very easy to carry around . Good photos and accurate exposures from my point of view . I am an experienced amateur who takes a lot of family and floral photos . You will be very pleased with this camera and lens . I would also add the 55-200mm VR to complete the package .  
2	  I just stocked up on this Memory card . The price on this is great ! I use it on a Fuji Finepix S800 . We travel a lot so I really do not get the chance to down load until I get back home and can con my sister into doing all the dirty work on the computer ( she feels needed and I 'm to lazy to do it ) for me . And yes , I am lazy since my computer already has digital media built into it . Anyway , I have never seen a XD ( extreme digital ) card this cheap ! The cheapest one I found was Wal-Mart at close to $ 60.00 not including tax , that was last year . I can average well over 300 excellent quality pictures with one card . Depending on your Quality settings I 'm sure you could get 150-600 if not more pictures out of this .  
2	  I like the fact that the stands are thin and less distracting than wider stands . The base is heavy enough so the stands don't fall over as easy as they would otherwise . I also like the fact that the channel in the back of the stand allows you to hide the speaker wire to make for a neater appearance . Well worth the price .  
1	  I got one of these to give out as a gift and one for myself - both the 2 gig version - both crashed enough that i never gave it out as a gift . When it crashes it doesen't reset , it just has to sit unresponsive for days and one of them came back to life when I pluged it into USB after a while . It crashed attempting to read a Microsd card - it crashed in the middle of listening to the radio - several crash while listening to mp3s . So , pretty crashy . The other thing is that the battery sucks itself dry if the unit is off but you were listening to the radio before you turn it off - so I always have to go into the menu and play an MP3 before I turn the thing off . Pros is that it cost about as much as a usb 2 gig stick and gets decent radio reception . The blue light looks great in the daytime but is awful at night .  
1	  After reading the reviews , I realized there were varied results from those who had purchased the Adesso Cyber-tablet 6400 . Since my daughter was going to use the pen and tablet in MS Paint , I thought it should work fine . Was I wrong ! The wireless mouse was irratic and the the pen worked about 50 % of the time . When the pen did work , it responded well after her mation started . Our computer is an average P-II Dell with plenty of memory . For the price , I expeced more . Adesso , find a another line of work ! Shopper , buy another product .  
2	  This is one of the reasons I bought a Nomad IIc . I always like slipping a piece of electronics into a dock rather than finding a cable and plugging it in . After you remove the " bumper " on the bottom of the player , it slips into the dock , latching thanks to an indentation on the player 's back . If you 're running SoundJam ( the MP3 converter included with your Nomad ) , a window will come up to show you the memory of your player - external too if you have a card . Not only can you transfer music at USB speed , but you can also recharge the battery at the same time . ( The dock comes with a rechargeable AA cell . ) This , though , was one of my complaints about the system :* Sometimes you have to " jiggle " the Nomad in the dock to get the charging light to register that it 's charging the battery . * This may just be the case with my unit , but sometimes the power connection inside the Nomad will fail . I think that this is just a bad seating of the battery , as it can often be cured by opening the compartment , fussing with the cell , and cursing . ( I think the cursing is optional . ) That 's all that kept this equipment from getting a five-star rating with me . I think it 's a perfect addition to an MP3 player that stands out from the crowd , and I wouldn't want to be without it .  
1	  My friend has a Tivo but I bought a ReplayTV because the service is free . His Tivo is so much better and easier to use . I have returned the ReplayTV and bought a 30 hr Tivo . I hope others don't repeat my mistake . Tivo 's show recomendations are great . It learns your viewing habits . It has 10 more hours than Replay , a better remote , and a really good program listing .  
2	  I 've used hot air brushes for a couple years . This works better than my last . The low setting and the larger brush works better for me . The high setting blows the hair off the bristles . It 's nice having the small brush option for different styles though . I believe my hair stays styled longer and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush versus a curling iron .  
1	  I bought this cable and it worked fine at first but after a while it started giving a shoddy signal . White specs would appear all over my screen and I would have to adjust the cable until they went away . Most of the time I would get no picture at all . I treat my electronics with care so it most likely wasn't my fault . Perhaps I just got a poorly constructed cable . Remember that you 're taking that risk when you buy this extremely cheap cable .  
1	  This TV worked fine and looked good - briefly . The problem is that it broke within 2 weeks of turning it on the first time . Just stopped working and won't even turn on . Toshiba has not been responsive or helpful at all in resolving the matter , simply directing me to a third party repair place . It has now been over 40 days since the TV broke , with no end in sight . In keeping with their product 's lack of quality , Toshiba 's customer service reps have been even worse ; two have hung up on me when I asked to speak to a manager to explain why their response has been completely unreasonable . Please note that Toshiba insists its warranty is only for repair , not replacement . That way , Toshiba tries to avoid having to replace its lemon TVs , like this model . I have spoken to several friends who had new LCD TVs from Sony and Samsung and who had problems initially ; those companies simply delivered a new TV in response . Toshiba , however , has proven to be a disaster of a company to deal with . I strongly recommend against this Toshiba product , as it and Toshiba 's customer service have proven to be nothing but a long-term headache . As a result , I likely will suffer a complete loss of the purchase price . Even if the unit is somehow repaired ( which will require at least 2 service calls , waiting on a technician , etc . ) , I will have been without the TV for at least 2 months . I plan to pursue litigation against Toshiba for its breach of its implied terms of reasonableness in its so-called " warranty , " but of course that is not what I or anyone else should have to resort to in order to resolve a problem that arose a mere 2 weeks out of the box . I realize this is only one unit , but Toshiba 's response has proven that it is not a company responsive to its customers . As a result , I will not be purchasing any Toshiba products in the future .  
2	  Have had the TV for 2 years . No problems at all . Display HD , HD-DVD , and Xbox 360 perfectly . No burn in . Wish it had better contrast in deep blacks and 1080p .  
1	  I first should say that I am responsible for at least three friends purchasing the Sanus VMDD26 TV mount . I also have the VMDD26 for my 50 inch plasma . My friend have 58 inch plasma screens . I would give the VMDD26 TV mount a five ( 5 ) , it is a great product . I would give the VMCC1 center speaker mount a one ( 1 ) , but I did get it to work , sort-of , and Sanus does answer the phone . The Sanus VMCC1 is not only hard to install . I comes with the wrong size spacers and center bolts for use with the VMDD26 . It took several interactions with , and photos sent to , Sanus before I finally got this response : " It sounds like we have the wrong spacers in the VMCC1 . I don't think there is anything to worry about on his end . " Really , I wonder why there were spacers in the kit to begin with ? I have not received any response to my request for the correct spacers and bolts , and it has been about a week . Details of dissatisfaction : There is NO adjustment for tilting speaker upward . Additionally , if you are mounting a Polk Audio SoundBar 50 ( which weighs 15 lbs , half the max for this mount ) you will need to improvise the attachment , as the SoundBar 50 have two very large mounting screws to mount the wall bracket connection . And the wall bracket itself has many holes for & 8 screws to attached to drywall , etc . You may need to create your own plate with plywood . One positive note ; Sanus does answer their phone and you get a live human . It is just that the engineeringand product management let this one out without much concern about ease of use , nor verification of what they where shipping . Probably made in China as the drawings look like the correct spacers are called out . But the user 's manual is not the best and shows the incorrect spacer that are included with the speaker mount .  
1	  The unit did not function out of the box . Customer service was awful . I sent 3 emails and they sent one form letter . Save your money and shop at a store that understands quality and customer service .  
2	  Have owned this in the past and very happy with it . Ordered two so would always have one available .  
2	  Pros : easy set up , lightweight , not too big , backlit , good help menu on the LCD screen on the remote , very smart remote ! Cons : button layout is not the best , burns through batteriesLove this remote ! This is my first ' real ' Universal Remote so I do not have much to compare to . Set up was easy for me through the USB cable and online set up . just make sure you follow the large format , 1 sheet , fold out ' quick install guide ' manual the comes with . Write down all your components / devices Model numbers first , then install software , plug in the USB cable to the remote , register an account , and start the set up . pretty easy . NOT SURE WHY SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE SET UP ! IT 'S EASY ! Love using just one remote to control all my 5 devices ! This thing is smart and you tweak any of the buttons to do just about whatever you want them to do . I have only had it for two weeks when I wrote this , so I cant speak of how long it takes to eat the batteries , but I imagine with the LCD screen the batteries wont last long . but that is to be expected with any remote like this . just get good quality rechargeable AA 's . Buttons could be laid out better . would like the " prev " , " exit " , and " guide " buttons to be larger and located better . I picked this up new , from Amazon for $ 65 , so I got a great deal . I wouldnt pay more than $ 100 for this remote , but is a steal at $ 65 . all in all I luv it ! serves the purpose it was made for .  
1	  I thought this Ink Set was great with my first purchase . Everything worked well . It was sent and received promptly , and the cartriges worked well . On my second purchase however , I 've had a problem with one of the cartriges and am waiting to see what happens with the complaint sent to Eforcity .  
2	  All the colours line up to my stereo ( CDXGT565UP ) and the only reason it doesnt get a 5/5 is the fact that I still have to figure out how to hook up the power wire to my stock power antenna ( all Vibes / Matrix 's will have this issue ) . Not a large concern though , as I found the power antenna wire very close to the antenna itself . I hope to simply hook up the power antenna wire to a ACC POWER wire , and all will be ok .  
1	  I am very disappointed in this hub . It worked just fine with my laptop for a whole 6 weeks , and then quit . An analysis of the problem revealed that the last time I used it , when I plugged in a flash drive , it caused the hub to malfunction and I lost all my drivers for the hub as well as for all my USB peripherals . I can fix the problem , but I shouldn't have to . What a terrible waste of time !  
2	  I purchased this notebook mouse , because I wanted a little more control of the cursor when editing music tracks we are creating . It does exactly what I needed , and is very easy to attach and detach from the computer . The reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is that it feels a little " plasticy . " Still , it works great .  
1	  i bought this camera no more then a couple days ago and it breaks ! i just bought a new media card and when i went to put it in the thing just froze or shut off . i would take it out then it went back on except the last time i did it , it didnt turn on anymore after that . now i have to return the memory card . i wouldnt buy this camera ever agian in my life . it broke in under two days of use . i hope this helps you .  
2	  Great ihome , dont be fooled by the low price great quality use it all the time  
2	  I 've had the camera for three days and it is everything I expected . Took about twenty minutes to read the " basic " manual which allowed me to take and view my first digital pictures . I followed the simple procedure for loading the software ( I have Win 98 ) and had my camera transferring those pictures to my computer in no time . My only regret is that I didn't spend the money to get the ac adapter and the rechargeables , these things eat batteries ! I 'm getting those items today ! Get the extra memory card ( I got the 64mb ) , the 8mb included is not enough . One other negative I had read about was the lens cover , however , I do not personally have a problem with that . As a matter of a fact , I like the lens tucked away when not in use . Bottom line initial impression : takes great pictures , feels good , easy to use , looking forward to getting into the more advanced features of this reasonably priced point and shoot .  
1	  I thought I 'd take a chance and save money on these cartridges . The color one didn't work at all from the start and the black works intermittently . Very frustrating . Back to paying a premium on HP brand ..  
1	  I read reviews that mention " E18 error " before buying this camera but I did not pay attention . I thought that there must be some defective units among millions of Canon cameras and that those camera that had the error must have been abused . Search for " canon e18 error " on google , and you will get 17,100 results as of 04/23/2005 . It is a very common problem and it can happen to your camera even if you don't abuse it . What is E18 error then ? The camera displays " E18 " on the screen when the zoom lense is stuck . Once it happens , you cannot use the camera again as it turns itself off after displaying the error code . There seem to be various causes for it - shock to the camera with the zoom lense extended , sand or dust in the zoom lense gear mechanism , TURNING OFF THE CAMERA WITH LOW BATTERY , no apparent reason at all , and so on . If your camera is out of warranty ( i.e. over 1 year old ) , you are out of luck as Canon charges $ 250 or so to fix it . You might try fixing it yourself ( $U$ but it seems too complicated for ordinary people . Maybe I should consider myself lucky as mine is just 7 months old and is still under warranty .  
1	  I bought this unit because I had an other " Brother " before . What a mistake . I had it for over a year , very light use ( a few copies , a few faxes ) . The machine uses a lot of ink . It performs self-cleaning every day . You run out of ink in a few months even if you are not using it . With no ink you cannot send or receive faxes ( even you are out of yellow and the fax report is printed black ) . Now I cannot send faxes at all , I am getting some " com " error . Its memory is full all the time ( 99 %) and sometimes prevents you sending faxes . Do not waste your money , go other place .  
1	  I recently purchased this item , and I was extremely disappointed . It was a horrible experience trying to install this item . The instructions for the drive did not match the type of drive , and on the western digital website , it didn't even list this drive to get instructions for . So , I followed the instructions that came with it to a T , to install the drive as a boot drive , copying all my information from my current drive , which was about to fail . It seemed to copy the files just fine and work ok as a slave drive , but then my original hard drive failed , and I moved this supposidly boot drive to be the single drive on my machine it would not work . Upon calling customer service to find out what was wrong , I was asked , did you make the boot drive through windows or dos ? I told her I just popped in the disk they gave me and ran it , and followed the instructions , click on " I want to make a boot drive " and not on " I want to make a drive for additional service . " She said that it sounds like I did it through windows mode , and it won't make a boot drive in windows mode , only if I was in dos mode . I asked her why this was not explained in the instructions , and now I had no original boot drive to try to do it again . She told me to run windows recovery . I asked if she could help me do that , because I couldn't figure it out , and she said no , windows isn't our product so we won't help you with that . I said , but if this is what I need to install this drive , it says you are supposed to offer me free installation help for 30 days , why won't you help me . Then I was spoken to as if I was a problem customer - you know , " MAAM , I TOLD YOU I CAN'T HELP YOU " in a nasty tone . I ended up going out , buying another hard drive to use as my primary and then installing windows from scratch , and having to reinstall all the drivers and programs I had on this new drive and I kept the western digital drive for a backup . All in all , I thought this was a waste of money , a waste of hours upon hours of time , and a terrible experience . I would never recommend purchasing this product .  
1	  I purchased this laptop in March 2011 as a birthday present for my son and it stopped working in August 2011 . All of a sudden the screen stopped functioning . When I took the laptop to an apple store to get it diagnosed they advised it needed a new LCD and it would cost another couple hundred dollars . Betamacs will not do anything since it is past the 30 day warrenty period so in hindsight I should have put the $ 200 towards a new computer if I was going to wind up spending $ 500 anyway .  
2	  A perfect accessory for people who have ipods and want a portable stereo system to play thier music . As expected from Bose the sound is excellent .  
1	  Never got it to work . I spent 1 hour on my own trying and an additional 45 minutes with tech support . Nothing . Sent it back for refund .  
2	  My first pair of RS 130 was bought from Costco to watch TV without disturbing my wife while she 's sleeping . I have used it for a couple years and it worked great . Sound quality , comfort , and distance coverage are excellent . Occasionally , I would wear it working in the garage or in the yards . We saw this item on sale at Amazon and quickly decided to get another one for use downstairs with the big TV . My wife wears it while cooking with the range hood fan running or when the kids are practicing their musical instruments . She loves it too !  
1	  My DGS-2205 worked fine for 13 months , now it just dies every once in a while . The power light stays on , but the port lights go off and the switch is inoperative . It will sometimes come back on it 's own , or a power cycle will bring it back to life , but if it won't stay up it is of no use to me .  
1	  We got this printer to handle all our printing needs for a typical family home that takes a lot of digital photos but doesn't print out very many . Since we don't have a lot of printing needs - occasional web pages , office documents and infrequent photos - the printer sits idle for the majority of the time . Every time we go to print photos it 's an hour-long ordeal of cleaning the print heads , printing test pages , burning through an amazing amount of ink - just for a couple photos for friends and family . Even for occasional web documents , if the printer 's been idle for any amount of time , the colors are completely inaccurate , the tints are off and the quality is fuzzy . This printer is capable of printing top-notch quality photos , but if you 're expecting a printer that will sit there and be ready for you whenever you want it to go , you 'll be disappointed . If you 're printing photos every day , you might find this a better printer . My family and I have decided , however , to get a better quality photo-specific printer in the future . Until then , we print photos from online services and are very happy with the results .  
1	  Really disappointing . I believe this unit was a prototype , and was rushed into production way too early . You buy it , and you are on your own . Hard to use . Missing expected features , for the price . Lots of bugs . No software updates . When you enter an address location , it gives you a really close up , tiny map of the area , but what it displays is so " close up " you can't tell if it found the correct area or even city city . You need to be able to zoom out when finding an address to make sure it is the right place . So you have to select it , say OK , save it , look at the place only to find it 's not what you wanted , and then delete it , and then try the next city area . I looked for a specific address in Harahan , LA by street address . It found SOMETHING , but since I could not zoom out , the address it found was in another city altogether ! I found another match in New Orleans , but what it found was not in New Orleans at all , but a different city . The map was wrong . The scroll up / down " thumb wheel " basically doesn't work . So scrolling up and down a list is like trial and error , jumpy , unreliable , and really frustrating . There is NO customer support for the unit . The support web site is almost non-existent or useless . There is no email support . If you have a problem , unless it is in warranty , and it is warranty related , you are out of luck . If you need assistance , none is available . For instance , the software update area says they routinely updates the software . After 1.5 years , it did not have an update . So they don't update the software . There is no way to tell what version of the software you have versus on the update page . The update page says like " SP1 " , but no version numbers . The iCN-750 shows only version numbers . So you can't even tell if you have the latest software version . But since the unit software hasn't been updated in 1.5 years , whatever bugs it has will likely stay that way . If you look at the FAQ and and typical questions on the support Web site , there are about 12 entries total , and and a good amount are about how to buy more from the company . Useless , not solve problemsThere is no convenient way to preview the route it selected graphically . The manual says you can put it in " Demo Mode " do play what routes it will take you . But it is SO SLOW , after 5 minutes I just gave up . The power off switch is is really hard to access . It 's sort of hidden . You need a very strong paper clip to reach it . A ball point pen won't work , because the lever to push is too small and the pen point is too large . Even then , it 's hard to determine if the switch is on or off . Periodically it goes " mute " by itself . We 'll notice it hasn't spoken to us in a while , only to find it put it self on " mute " for some reason . So we 've missed turns , sometimes missing the turn by 20 miles ! You can't have a GPS that just stops talking to you . Some cities are broken down by " north area , south area , west area , east area , etc . " So if you are looking for an address , you first have to know where in the city it is to start with so you select the correct region first . If you select the wrong region , it may find a street match , but since you can't zoom out to check basically where it is , you may well drive to the wrong part of town . This unit is SO disappointing . And it cost so much . And without support , I would recommend BUY ANOTHER BRAND of GPS .  
2	  I have Windows XP and this was the easiest hardware ever installed ! Just plug it in !  
1	  These particular cables just do not work . The supplier was responsive and replaced them but the second batch had the identical problems . Again the supplier responded promptly with a refund but just beware of some manufacturer HDMI cables .  
1	  never got this item , had to get money back for it . a month and never got it , even emailed them , nothing happened , sucks , and never doing business with them again  
2	  I 've spent some time working overseas during the years , and the power grids are not always reliable . We occassionally see power spikes and brownouts from day to day that can cause serious damage to electronic equipment . I purchased the Tripp Lite TRAVELERC6 Protect It ! Surge Protector / Suppressor after a spike nearly took out my laptop computer . I spent days getting the computer going again after the lights suddenly flickered several times one night and then went off completely . This Tripp Lite unit is easy to use , just plug it in between the cord and the power supply and forget it . A green light indicates that it 's working and I 've noticed no difference in the way my computer operates . Thankfully there hasn't been another situation where the unit would be tested ( that I 'm aware of ) , but hopefully I 'm ready for the next power surge . This surge protector comes in a two pin and three pin model , so be sure to purchase the correct unit for your own computer if the need should arise . Please rate this review if you found it helpful .  
1	  Having technical difficulty with the voice command function not playing back through the speakers . Phone gets command ok , but cannot hear responce .  
1	  Got the router , installed it , used it with Vonage for last 2 years : 1 ) Slow to reboot2 ) Have to reboot after EVERY configuration screen . 3 ) Drops your calls when rebooting ( some routers don't ! ) 4 ) Every 2-3 months the router gets " constipated " and gets very sluggish and unreliable requiring a HARD reset and reconfiguration ( see # 2 above ) . 5 ) This model is LOCKED to Vonage service .. can't change Voip service providers . 6 ) After 2 years the router simply quit working . All the lights work , but it doesn't route anymore and it doesn't let you make phone calls anymore . 7 ) Small glitches with its routing ability . The more configuration you do , the slower the routing becomes . Very underpowered processor doing the routing . So yes , Vonage is inexpensive phone service .. but when you have to buy a new router every 1-2 years it isn't as cheap as you initially think !  
2	  was a birthday gift and an excellent choice . works great just as described and was a big hit !  
2	  This is an exellent buy if this is your first brass spyglass . For being so sheap this sure is good quality , every part of it is verry accurate . I really do have seen a lot worse . People who do not CARE to examine and learn for themselves OR are not used to handle and use spyglasses may have some problem getting the focus right . In any case the focus is really sharp when you do get it right . You need to twist the smallest tube to change the focus depth . Pracise make perfect ! Even thou its not verry big in size i found that it was as " big " and heavy as i would tolerate for easy carrying and easy use in a larp . You may carry it in a small beltbag , and it fits nicely in your palm . The only bad thing about it was the fake-leather . I bought it to use on a Pirate LARP ( Live Action Role Playing ) and i had to remove the plastic " leather " and sew on a new real piece of darkbrown leather myself . Besides this , modern brass items are often lacquerd with a special clear brass protective lacquer , witch makes it impossible to corrode . I wandted that antique feeling since im using it on larps . So in order to get that old look to it I took everything apart ( total disensembling ) , and polished off the lacquer using a grinding machine with a verry fine polishing rondell , and reassembled it . Afer two months it looked like a movie prop , corroded ( darkened ) and beautiful . However I do not recommend anyone to do this UNLESS you are a craftsman who knows how to work metals and have basic ( proffessional ) polishing skills . If you are going to do this anyway , be extra careful to remove the glass parts so that you dont accidentally polish them ! And be careful not to grind away any metal or you may destroy it completley . There are more than five , exactly the same , spyglasses here on Amazon . com they look exactly the same and comes with the same fake-leather carrying case . So im leaving this rating on a fiew of them . They are all manufactured in the same place , probably china , and distributed to the different vendors . I hope my rewiew was any help to you ! Have a Good Larp ! :D  
1	  The only decent thing about this mic is that it looks alright and is easy to use . However , I usually had to keep the mic directly next to my mouth in order to be heard and the quality wasn't that great . The base of it is also very light so it moves around easily and often tips over . I 'd highly suggest the Logitech USB Desktop Mic , which I 've also used , and is much better for less than $ 10 more .  
1	  I got this unit and it was defective . I tried e-mails toboth the seller and Amazon and got no response from either . I had to take it to the next level and challenge the chargeon my credit card to try to get someones attention !  
2	  Cheap , fast , rugged , you name it . Made it run with Windows XP Home . Had to reflash the firmware and reset it first , though . So if you are buying it for the fun of installation , you may want to go with a linksys . Honestly , I love it .  
1	  I was not told about a fairly large dent against the earphone socket - the earphones still worked , but I would have liked to be aware of a dent in such an important place instead of being told that there were simply " dents . "  
2	  These monitors are a steal at $ 255 . The picture is super sharp ; I was so happy with them that I bought 25 more for my office . Highly recommended !  
1	  i returned it 2 days later , after i 've found out ipod nano and old ipod are more responsive . how come apple allow supposedly new products to be released with less impressive user experience than the one they hope to repalce ..  
1	  I 'm astonished at how loud the fan noise is in our model . It emits a high pitched wining sound . It 's tolerable during the day but at night I find myself turning off the power strip . Operating the DVD wasn't too bad after reading the manual . It took some patience since the manual or menu features aren't entirely user friendly . Another annoying quirk is when we turn on the unit to use the VCR , the VCR will come on and then immediately switch over to the DVD . We have to hit the VCR button to put it back in VCR mode . We 've had this model for a few years and decided to keep it since we got it for a terrific sale price .  
2	  I have no experience with external hardrive enclosures . This was a quick and easy install . Just popped in my old hardrive and attached it to the computer . You can't mess up ! I loved it because it looks nice , it has a green and blue LED in the front telling you what 's going on , and it has a on / off switch . The encasement does not get that warm , despite hours of use . I would really recommend this product , especially for a first time user .  
1	  Only plays CDs when it feels like it . My new one would never play a dic in position 1 and would not play brand new CDs in any position . If it played a CD without any problem , the next time I turned the player on , it would not play that same CD . And the seller would not do a thing . Beware . They are turning out pure junk now for CD changers . Carolyn Reed  
2	  when I bought my Intel iMac w / 20 " LCD suddenly everything else looked dull in comparison . This Apple 20 " is very close in spec to my iMac 20 " screen . Stores like Best Buy do not have good quality 20 + " LCDs in yet . You want the 16x9 profile also , the regular square LCDs look dorky in comparison and typically have lower brightness and contrast ratios . The newer stuff is very bright and clear . It is obvious when you go to a store and look at the LCD screens . The cheap $ 200 LCDs just don't look good in comparison to the new stuff . Intel iMac screen : 1680x1050280 cd / m2 ( brightness in candle power ) 800:1 Contrast ratioApple 20 " LCD1680x1050250 cd / m2400:1 Contrast14ms response time ( ww . apple . com / displays / specs . html ) Other comparables : Gateway 21 " 1680x1050 $ 599300 cd / m2 1000:1 contrastDell 24 " 2405FPW $ 8001920 x 1200500 cd / m21000:1 contrastYou should be aiming for at least 300 cd / m2 on brightness and close to 1000:1 contrast . These Apple LCDs have been out for awhile and are starting to show their age in comparison to the brand new products that have just started to come out . If you are using your LCD for a TV you may need the brightness , but for computer work the Mac 20 " LCD is just about right . I paid a few $ more ( $ 750 total price ) for the Apple LCD , but I feel I made the correct purchase . I just didn't like the way the others looked and it had to look good against my iMac . I actually like this screen better than the one on my iMac and it seems just as bright even if the specs say that it is not . Amazon also boxes the shipment ( besides the Apple box ) so your screen should arrive undamaged .  
2	  I love my little laptop . My husband originally bought me the Vaio FE series . I thought that was a little big for my 5 ft frame and humbly asked him to get me a slightly smaller one . Although the sales person couldn't understand why I 'd want to downgrade . It 's a girl thing . It 's 5 pounds and fits nicely in a bag . I have the Anika Candy stripe bag to carry it around in . The keyboard is very easy to use and I can use the touch pad like a pro already ( I thought I might need a mouse but really , I don't ) . The only con I can find is that it makes tiny little noises sometimes . The FE was completely quiet . I have the espresso black with copper trim version and feel it 's quite fashionable . Plus , it comes with a whole bunch of important computer stuff like a dvd burner , centrino duo , etc . I left the specifics up to hubby in that department .  
1	  I purchased this the Canon PIXMA mp530 in December of 2007 . The reviews were positive and I 've known people with Canon printers who were happy with them . I have not used the fax feature , but have been using the print , copy , and scanning features . About 3 months into using the printer it kept saying that the magenta ink tank was empty , but when checked it was full . For about a month I was able to open up the printer , take the magenta ink tank out and put it back in temporarily solving the problem , but then that stopped working . If any of the ink tanks are empty or the machine thinks it is empty the printer is rendered useless .. forget printing even in black only , copying in black , and even scanning . Had I been aware of this problem I would not have purchased this printer and would warn anyone who does to keep plenty of extra ink on hand , because even if the ink tanks are not empty they may malfuction which will put a stop to use of the printing , copying , and scanning functions . I verified that there is no way around this with Cannon , their response when asking about this was " Unfortunately , the MP530 will not print or copy when one of the ink tanks is empty or there is an ink error . Since copying uses the scanner , this also includes the scanning system . " If you contact Canon regarding malfunctioning ink tanks they will replace it but it is a hassle .  
2	  If you are like me : 1 . Who is thinking of buying his next camera . 2 . Have never used SLR before . 3 . Wonder if it is really worth it to spend extra for Rebel , instead of a good point-n-shoot from Canon ( for half the price ? ) . Well , Yes it is worth it , even the complete automatic mode is much better than best in the class point and shoot . And as you try other semi-automatic modes ( like sports , night , portrait , closeup ) , you will realize it was all worth it . I have recently promoted myself to using Av / Tv mode and took picture at very less light , without flash . They look so natural compared to generic point and shoot .  
1	  I am both amused and dismayed by the extremely enthusiastic reviews of this product . The statements such as " best headphones for under X dollars " where X is often 75 and 100 dollars . Those words were of course , said by people who haven't used a set of good $ 100 headphones . HD201s have one big con , and that is comfort . Sennheiser skimped on the design of cushion pads . They 're really thin . As a result your ears will touch the drivers ' housing , which is made of hard plastic . After wearing these headphones for more than one hour , my ears start hurting very badly . The design is borderline garbage . I don't care if these headphones sound as good as $ 70 or $ 100 headphones ( and for the record , they don't . I own a part of HD555s too ) . Given the terrible comfort , they can't be worth more than $ 20 . You get what you pay for and that 's that . If you 're going to wear headphones for a long period of time , does the price difference of $ 20 between these and say Koss UR-40 or Koss PortaPros really matter ? I 'd rather wear more expensive headphones and not feel the excruciating pain in my ears . Next issue is the cable , which is flimsiest of the long headphone cables I have seen in my life . The 10ft long cable gets always on the way . It 's specially annoying if you use it with a PC or anywhere where your source is close . The cable will be on your laps , on the floor , it will be stepped on . It will be all over the place . Next , the quality of the wire deserves a lot to be desired . It 's really thin , and there is little shielding . This means that a lot of power is lost due to wire 's length , and the wire is susceptible to electromagnetic interference . If you use a flimsy cable , you 're much better with a 4 ft cable and with a 10ft cable . Finally , given the price of only $ 20 , these headphones are surprisingly hard to drive . A lot of portable devices and some computers need to have their volume level to be set at 90 % or higher . Perhaps , the super-long wire has to do with these . But anyways , all I can say is " blah " .. Spend around $ 20 more on better headphones .  
2	  The DC290 has exceeded my expectations in image and color quality . Truly outstanding pictures ! Yes , it did eat my akaline batteries in under an hour ( most digital cameras do that ) , but the rechargables shipped with the camera are doing well . I bought to more sets ! I 'll probably get the AC adapter but I use a card reader so I 'll wait and see . It would be wise to buy a larger flash card . I bought 32mb and have the 16mb that came with the camera as well . I was pleasantly surprised that the serial cable was packed ( as well as a usb cable ) so I can use it with any WIN 95 machine . I found the camera a snap to operate out of the box . The menu is user friendly and easy to operate . I don't use the display much to conserve battery power . However , it is useful for close range shooting . Another great feature is the external flash mode . I 've used it successfully . The scripts that can be downloaded ( free ) making the capabilties of this camera a great buy . I upgraded from a Kodak DC50 which also gave me great service . This camera is a truly great value in the tradition of the Kodak Company . ..  
2	  With fast shooting high mega pixel cameras , the CF card can be a major performance factor . Why have one of these cameras and use a card that cannot keep up ? When prices started dropping on CF cards , I decided it was time to get yet another one . The Extreme II cards write with a 20 MB / sec sequential read / write speed . These fast write speeds are desirable with large image files . There are cameras with buffers to hold images while writing to the card during continuous shots . At some point if the card cannot write fast enough , your camera will stop shooting until the buffer clears enough room . This card has a high impact rating . For example ; if you were to accidentally drop this card 10-foot up to then hit the floor , this card is rated to sustain the fall without damage . Also consider this card can withstand temperatures from - 13 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit ( as indicated on the package ) . Since I live in Texas , I doubt I 'll ever have a problem with the card getting too cold . It is nice to know that I could possibly leave the card in a car under the hot Texas sun and it may still work . I 've yet to test this scenario , and its unlikely I ever will . Sometimes the trade off on price comes from power consumption . Lower priced cards may use more power to do the same job as this card . The low power consumption of this card means a longer battery life . People generally want to know how many images a card will hold . This is a difficult question to answer and greatly depends on both the card and the camera it is used in . The number of images this card will hold on my 20D also depends on the settings used . Let me provide a few settings and image counts for an idea of what this card holds . Shooting Raw w / ISO 100 - 221 imagesShooting Raw w / ISO 800 - 206 imagesShooting Large jpeg - 479 imagesShooting Medium jpeg - 825 imagesShooting Small jpeg over 999 images ( the 20D cannot provide counts above 999 ) I use both a 1GB and a 2GB card shooting primarily raw images . Sometimes the 1GB card is more than adequate , but other times I could easily fill the 1GB card quickly . There have been many days where I have taken 200-300 pictures without the opportunity to transfer my images . The 2GB card not only gives me more storage space , but also permits me to change the card in a slow moment before it completely fills up . It is truly aggravating to lose a shot because your card filled up . For these reasons I tend to prefer the 2GB cards . When considering the card size , one should attempt to balance convenience with capacity . Having one card for all your images may be convenient , but it is also putting all your eggs in one basket . Worried about reliability ? The Extreme II cards have a dedicated technical support line ( 1-866-270-5532 ) . Plus it 's backed with a lifetime limited warranty outside Europe . The warranty excludes any defects , malfunctions , performance failures or damages to the card resulting from use in other than its normal and customary manner , misuse , accident or neglect ; or improper alterations or repairs . If something should go wrong , this CF card comes with the Rescue Pro recovery software . Fortunately I have had no need for the software . For that purpose I cannot give much comment on its usefulness . Overall , I do not notice the benefits of this cards speed over the Ultra II when used with the 20D . The other benefits between this and the Ultra II are not necessarily a big plus for me . I like having the recovery software , so for the few extra dollars I am happy . With a big price difference , I would definitely stick with the Ultra II . If the temperature ratings or the Rescue Pro recovery software is an important feature for you , the Extreme II is the card to get . Otherwise , consider purchasing the Sandisk Ultra II CF Card and save some cash .

1	  1 . Olympus doesn't provide drivers online . Why not ? It 's not like they have any value if you haven't purchased the player already . 2 . The VN series is evidently not compatible with Windows Vista . It won't let me reinstall the drivers . 3 . The forced file hierarchy ( A , B , C groups ) is dumb and causes problems . Why can't I just plug it in and drag / drop your files in Windows Explorer ? 4 . When you speak , S 's pop even when you 're a couple of feet away . I wish I had purchased another brand .  
1	  After what seemed like months of hype in magazines , book reviews and NPR , I was chomping at the bit to read The Little Friend . About half way through the book I began to wonder if all those critics had been given a different edition to read . The story idea is interesting , but the characters are wooden and the prose is awkward-a fine literary vocabulary , but decidedly lacking in finesse . I 'd recommend Swan by Frances Mayes as an alternate read .  
2	  Great pruchase for the price ! I am about 35 to 40 miles away from the stations I want to hear on AM .. You have to point the radio in that direction , but it is great for what i use it for .. As I said .. for the price , I am pleased !  
1	  These are good enough for what I need in headphones for walking around , but they always break . I mean , I understand that everything will eventually break - but things are only inexpensive if they last a reasonable amount of time . If these cost $ 15 and you need to buy 4 pairs a year , compared to ones that cost $ 25 and they last two years , the latter are the less expensive pair . Being cheap , I would prefer if these would just not break so easily - and it isn't that I 'm being rough with them - I treat them well , but eventually they die ( usually the sound goes out in the left ear ) . I am no longer going to get these , fool me .. 4 times . Doh !  
2	  Everyone has strong personal preferences for keyboards that can result in opposite reviews , as is true for this product . For me this keyboard is a pleasure to use . Most important to me for a wireless keyboard is the reliability of the bluetooth connection . I am pleased to say that I have had no connectivity problems and no erratic or " dead " keys . The keyboard requires a lighter touch than many keyboards since the keys do not depress as much as on other keyboards . Whether you like such a touch , which is fine for me , is a matter of preference , but by no means does such a touch make the keyboard " flimsy . " On the other hand , if you like to " pound " on a keyboard when you type , you should choose something else . I like that the keyboard occupies only a small footprint on my desk , and that I can easily move it when I want to use the desk space for something else . I also like that the keyboard is not cluttered with all kinds of media and shortcut buttons . I have a keyboard like that for my pc laptop connected to an external monitor , and it takes up twice the desk space . Also , since I use this with a MacBook connected to an external monitor , the keyboard has its own shortcuts with the existing keys . For use with an Apple computer this keyboard works great . Update December 22 , 2010 . I have been using this keyboard for almost three years and am still very happy with it .  
2	  Why would you pay $ 60 + for HDMI cables when these work just as well ? If you go to a store the sales clerk will tell you that the expensive cable is better . If you don't know better , it 's easy to believe that . Don't be fooled ! These cables work just as well at a fraction of the cost .  
1	  The magnetic clasp would not stay closed and my Inno fell out , causing the the internal antenna to break and the caseing to crack . Don't buy this !  
1	  This is the second pair I 've owned that have stopped working on one side . I thought perhaps it was user-error the first time , having caught my hand in the wire and yanked it a bit hard . But the second pair has gone the same way . Too bad , to . They seemed to stay in play under heavy activity ( running , mountain trail hiking ) better than others , but won't hold up over time . I got a good 8 months out of this last pair .  
2	  This remote control does what it says its supposed to do . It 's constructed more solid than previous models . It recognizes the vast majority of any device you can throw at it . All you do it enter the model # of your tv , vcr , dvd player , or even your nintendo wii . If by chance it didn't have your device it will learn from your existing remote . The battery charge last for weeks at a time . Yes , I did say its rechargable . I recommend it to everyone even if your a little challenged with computers . It helps you along the way nicely .  
1	  The tape does not fit in it - and , if it does , it is too difficult to get the tape to fit .  
1	  This camera takes terrible photos . On auto mode you have to take 3-5 photos in a row to get one good one that is not over exposed , underexposed or just a blank black photo with no image at all . DO NOT GET THIS CAMERA unless you want to be stuck with a lemon .  
2	  I plugged it into my daughters 5 year old dell desktop , and now she can download photos and videos at lightening speed . This was an extra value because it came with the 6ft cable too .  
2	  I purchased these headphones after being disappointed by the Boss E3c 's . E500 's : These are the best headphones i have ever heard ( you hear , you don't use these . ) . They sound just as good if not better than any car audio i have heard ( i 've heard alot of high performance in-car systems ) . The highs are as they should be , as are the lows AND THE MID IS PERFECT . I could run my mouth about how legit my ears are but / meh . Buy em'As far as their build goes : the mich system is well built . The seal on my ear was perfect out of the box and some of the other buds fit even better . The noise cancelation is better than boss and doesn't mudd up the music at all . And it comes in one sexy box . - Don't fret over the extra $ save ( even if it takes a year ) and buy these over the E4c 's . After comparing the two : these are far superior .  
1	  I did some research and read a lot of reviews at many sites and online retailers for this FM transmitter . I decided to buy it since I was planning a road trip around New England and some Canadian cities , and thought this would be the greatest companion for my MP3 player during the trip . I has very dissapointed by it 's weak signal . When there is no static , and the device is able to fully transmit to the selected station , the sound is no better than a AM radio station . It sounds very low quality . But most of the time , in both cities and the open road , I got static . I was so frustrated by it , that I stopped at a W @ llm @ rt store and bought a cassette adapter for $ 9 which was way better than this device . I realize not all cars have a cassette player these days , but if your car does , without a doubt they are better than any FM transmitter . After the trip was over , I returned the rental car I had , and tested it on my wife 's SUV and also in my own car and the results were exactly the same . On a positive note , it kept my MP3 player charged the whole trip .  
2	  No frills basic receiver with excellent power . I think Yamaha under rates their output , seems more than 50 watts per chan . Was bought to replace an older Yamaha product and Yamaha styling still perfectly matches my other components .  
2	  I put it in my 07 ' taurus . My car came with a cassette deck , so I put a Metra 99-5717 Taurus / Sable 04-07 Dash kit in so I could listen to my CD 's . I also used a Pioneer DEH-1200MP CD Receiver with MP3 / WMA Playback and Remote Control . It was kind of a hastle running the wire harness back to the trunk , but all the color coded wires matched up perfect ! This kit also has the airbag light in it !  
2	  Great cable ( 5 meters / 16.4 feet ) that is totally pro quality . This USB 2.0 A male to B male is connected to my HP Photosmart C7180 and my Toshiba Satellite laptop . Looks great and works perfectly !  
2	  Unlike the previous diNovo which was plagued by it 's connection problems and using batteries instead of rechargeable lithium , the Edge is Bluetooth and includes rechargeable lithium batteries . The only thing that it does not include is a number pad , which is a shame but that area is being used for the touch pad and volume control . I have to say this is simply the most eloquent keyboard you will ever own ( and no I am not talking about those keyboards that includes precious metals which are not required ) . Besides it 's looks , the keyboard is comfortable to type on , you will be amazed on how quickly you are able to type on this keyboard . Also , for those who like typing at an angle , you can raise the tabs to make it go up . There are a lot of features ( otherwise this keyboard would not cost over $ 150 ) which you can configure by using the logitech software ( which is included with the box ) . Charging the unit is a breeze since it takes a little over 2 hours to fully charge which can last for about 2 months . Recommended for Windows XP and Vista only ! Mac and older versions of Windows ( 2000 , ME , 98 ) not supported , though Macs recognize it you will not be able to use all of the functions .  
2	  Well made - very rugged - lots of room . What can I say - Pelican makes as great product . I will buy more of these . EDIT 10-23-2012I bought another of these for mics and stuff . Love this case !  
1	  These VHS tapes are garbage . On short play , ALL ( we bought 5 ) show distortion at the beginning of the tape . On long play they are completely unwatchable . If you are thinking it might be the VCR , think again , we have an older tape that looks perfect in short AND long play . I found better tapes at the $ 1 store back when you could find VHS tapes at the $ 1 store . Save your money .  
1	  I really didn't have good luck with this fax printer . It would try to send a fax once and then give up if it got a busy signal or other interruption . It would then make this really annoying alarm sound that basically meant " tough luck buddy " . I tried working with the settings but couldn't figure it out . I tried using it as a backup printer but the driver I downloaded didn't work . The wizard software wouldn't recognize the printer being plugged in even though the computer did . It did make copies okay . If anyone wants one , they can have mine .  
2	  I am very pleased with this camera . I especially like the light meter that tells you how many apertures you are away from the correct exposure . I am using this for my photo class and is easy to use .  
1	  canceled the order , because they wanted seven bucks to ship less than an ounce of a three dollar product . Found elsewhere , a lot less expensive .  
2	  Set this up without any problems ( no tech support ! ) and have been using wirelessly for over one week without any problems .  
1	  Installation went smoothly however I do not seem to have all the functionality for the control of a Sharp Aquos TV . In particular , there does not seem to be an equivalent of the button on the Sharp remote that allows picking the " View Mode " ( stretch , zoom , etc . ) and there is no owner 's manual to help with this , either in the package or on-line . Also , the unit cannot control my Bose system as its ' control is not infra-red , however you would not know that from the info on the Amazon site and you discover it only when doing the installation .  
1	  I don't ask much from my cables , i just ask that they take the output from my computer and put the image on my screen without lines missing . I am sorry to say that this cable could not even live up to my hopes . I have missing lines that constantly flicker on my screen . Its almost like 90 % of the lines are being refreshed each time and the rest are left blank and its dizzying to look at . It is not my computer as i plug it in to other monitors and even my tv and everything is fine , and its not my monitor because whatever i plug the cable into it into exhibits the annoying line problem . Beware of bad QC .  
2	  I always trust Logitech to make good PC peripherals . I 've got all Logitech game conrollers , mice , keyboards and on one PC , even the speakers . Although the Logitech headphones suck , the mice are top notch . It is accurate and comfortable . Only downside is that sometimes the scoll wheel goes crazy and scrolls too much or very sporadically but that is rare . A terrific mouse . I use it for daily use .  
2	  It was cheap when I bought it . It 's a lot cheaper now . And it 's still working with no problems in my Canon Ixus 900Ti . I 'd recommend it . Actually if you 're like me and use your digicam to record a lot of videos , I 'd say get a 16GB Class 6 SDHC card . They don't cost that much more .  
1	  I only received the memory stick , but not the adapter as pictured . It was retail packaged and clam shell sealed , but did not include the the adapter !  
1	  I 've become convinced there is a timer or expiration mechanism on the ink cartridge usage on this device . I didn't notice right away because I used the device a lot and it seemed OK . But my usage has waned and here is what happens : I replace all cartridges and print two pages . 3 months later I go to print 2 more pages and it claims the ink is half gone . 2 months later I print one more page and it claims the cartridges are empty and need to be replaced . 7 PAGES AND THE CARTRIDGES ARE EMPTY ! I ignore the empty warnings for another dozen pages or so before I break down and buy new cartridges . This is still terrible performance . I 've now read on other forums if you ignore the empty warnings long enough the whole device will lock up and become unusable . I will never buy another Canon product .  
2	  The canon deluxe photo backpack 200EG is what I was looking for my new canon xsi . The movable compartments are good for organizing the extra lens I have which is a 55-250 lens . As well as lens covers , wipes , ect .. I still have room for more lenses . I have added extra elastic straps with velcro to help hold my camera in place . The interior see through compartments are good for cords , extra battery & charger as well as other items that I might need . The 1st outer compartment I use for my user manual and other paperwork . The 2nd outer compartment is empty for now , but I put snacks in it . The padded shoulder straps and back make it comfortable for bike riding . The cross body strap also helps to keep the pack from shifting side to side when riding a bike .  
1	  This recorder did not meet my standards . It plays back professionally produced audio tapes just fine , but recording quality is bad . I tested both the condenser mic and used two different hand-held microphones , as well as three different tapes , and the recording quality is bad .  
1	  I have had these speakers for a little over a year . They are the worst set of computer speakers I have ever owned period . First impressions where that they had really tinny , thin sound to them . Like louder laptop speakers .. Not good at all . Maximum volume is also not very high and they start cracking at anything above half volume . Now after a year something has failed so that only one of the speakers works .. You get what you pay for but there are better cheap computer speakers out there for the same or lower price . DO NOT BUY !  
1	  I returned my purchase to Bose for an exchange for one that doesn't have the same problem . I left empty-handed . Turns out the problem is just mine . When the CD Changer is attached to the Wave CD player the system will only stop playing the CDs when you push " STOP " on the remote ! Otherwise the CD or CDs will play endlessly . Or I can disconnect the CD Changer from the main CD Player for those times I want to just play one CD and have it stop when it 's done . I said to the tech on the phone and the salesperson in the store that $ 650.00 is a lot of money for a system that can't just play one , two or more CDs and stop when finished playing . I guess they specialize in superb sound with limited focus on other features . Maybe they feel that the sound is so good that you will want to hear it non-stop ! So I will look for something less costly for the bedroom upstairs . I will wait for Bose to " fix " this " problem " . It seems so basic .  
1	  When I am playing non-film content , i.e. TV Shows or hybrid content ( interlaced + film ) , the video on the screen will flicker between most quick scene changes . I noticed it alot on " The Shield - Seasons 1 and 2 " and on DVDs burned from Tivo content . I know its not a bad player because I have 2 of these each bought at different times and they both have this exact same problem . I have a feeling that it has a hard time with interlaced content , since all hollywood movies ( film , 24fps ) plays just perfect . I could not find any settings on the player to help alleviate the problem . I am using the S-Video output . I have since switched to the new Philips 642 and this DVD player plays everything great , even divx discs . NOTE : The flicker I mentioned was caused by an incorrect setting . If you set the film mode correctly then it plays fine . So in retroscpect I would give this player a 4 star rating .  
2	  From what I 've used of the product so far , it works pretty well . There is hardly any static and the music comes in very well . I haven't used it in remote areas yet , but I would rate the product as very good .  
2	  This stand is very portable . It 's adjustable . Folds up into a small space . I can carry it in my pocket or in my Amazon sleeve along with my iPad and Kindle . Works well with either the Kindle and iPad . It seems to be sturdy enough . No worries !  
1	  I bought this printer in March of 2007 hoping to use it 's Bluetooth capabilities as well as print out some super photos for scrapbooking . Well , the bluetooth feature required a $ 50 USB adapter and it didn't print one photo of any quality I would ever use for any purpose . Oh well , at least I still have a printer to print school and work documents right ? No . I 'd say about 50 % of the time I would click " print " it would throw back an " ERROR 5700 " code . As long as I powered the printer down and the turned it back on it would print .. maybe 75 % of the time . I had a fatal error in September of 2007 ( 6 months later ) which required that it go in for repair ( for 4 weeks ) . Then in February of 2009 ( out of warranty ) it contracts another fatal error . I will give kudos to Canon Tech Support who waived the $ 9.99 service fee since I had previous issues with this printer . Also , I was given a 15 % discount ( yay ? ) for a new canon printer . Meanwhile , I have $ 50 worth of unused ink cartridges that are pretty much worthless . Looking at all the positive reviews out there , I suppose I got a lemon , but seriously .. I hate this printer .  
2	  In the past I 've purchased replacement batteries for my Uniden phone from Radio Shack . This year I noticed my phone wasn't holding a charge more than an hour so I knew it was time for a new battery , before the phone couldn't hold a charge at all . I walked over to Radio Shack ( with my phone handset and its battery ) to purchase a replacement . Because the battery in my phone didn't list any technical specs , I wasn't sure which battery I needed because the new battery packages didn't have enough information for me to be sure I had the right battery and the store clerk didn't know either . Also , I noticed the price for batteries had nearly doubled . Between the price and the store clerk , I decided to go back home and check on Amazon for a replacement . I was surprised that I could get the same battery on Amazon for well under the price at Radio Shack . The technical specs were detailed enough that I felt confident I 'd ordered the right battery . Even paying for shipping , the total price was several dollars less than Radio Shack . The item shipped quickly and , although I don't have any electronic testing equipment to verify this , it seems to work as well as any previous battery . In comparison to my experience at Radio Shack ( which I won't include here because it was not the usual , satisfied experience I 've always had in the past ) , the Amazon purchase was a breeze . I expect I 'll buy another back up battery in the next few months so I have it on hand next year ( these batteries only last a year or two ) but I 'll definitely check out Amazon first before I buy any electronics in the future ..  
2	  Alright , so I opted for an FM transmitter to play my ipod because it would cost hundreds to put in an AUX jack to my car stereo . I was going to get the transmitter specifically for ipods , but I have the 4th gen nano , and I read that it doesn't charge them anyways . Then I looked at this one and I figured that because of the USB port , it can charge anything , including my nano . It does ! Also I held down the preset button to get it to LX mode and then INTL so I could get to the 87.9 frequency . Then I made all 4 presets set to 87.9 , just hold down for the number to flash and you 're good . ZERO STATIC at these settings ! Just make sure the ipod volume is all the way up or else it will think the signal is weak and it turns off . When this happens i just hit the small preset button , and since all 4 of them are the same frequency , it 's all good . Only con is that when you plug it in or start the car , it is set to some random frequency , not the one you used previously . Again , this is why it 's good to set some presets so you only need to push one button . Overall , this is an awesome device ! And I got mine for 7 bucks ! Total steal , everyone with a car and an ipod needs one of these pronto .  
1	  Although the AC Adapter still works , the wires were exposed through the plastic after only a week . Furthermore , many times after I plug it into my computer , the screen flashes meaning that the adapter is not constantly charging my computer .  
1	  I have now owned 2 of these printers and I thought they were very good at first . However , after a couple of months I started experiencing paper feed problems . The printer just won't grab the paper . You have to try all sorts of paper amounts in the feeder before you come up with a proper thickness where it grabs . My patience has run out on this second printer and I will go back to the Canon .  
2	  This little wonder will enable you to take your favorite tunes on the road . I bought one for my mother . Her car radio has an audio input jack . She simply plugs one end into the radio and the other into the iPod nano - and voil & agrave ; - music . Don't be fooled by others selling this product for 2x-10x the price : it 's just a simple cord .  
2	  I have this computer down at school , and it has been a very good investment . At its small price , you really cant ask for a better deal . Its battery is amazing , and the performance is second to none .  
2	  Excellent features on this DVD player . The remote is a little confusing , but that is only due to the fact that I didn't read the manual . Most electronic remotes are intuitive , but the one supplied with this DVD player has a small learning curve . I would definately recommend this DVD player to anyone . Excellent piece of electronics .  
2	  I am so glad I purchased this for my IPod , I have small grandchildren .. that should explain the need for the cover . It has protected my IPod , also a great value .  
1	  When using headphones , these speakers are plagued by annoying white noise ( hissing ) in the background . The hissing sound is not a function of volume ( turn the volume completely off and the noise is still there ) , but goes away only when the speakers are shut off . My officemate 's Harmon Kardon speaker system does not have this problem . Just now , I bought the Creative Labs SBS270 , and I 'm sending the Accent system back .  
1	  I ordered this Elite screen after receiving 2 defective Ultra 100 " screens . The customer service rep assured me these were more sturdy , yet it arrived with parts loose rattling around inside and the screen just unraveled out instead of the spring-loaded stuff , and will never go back in . The reviews for Elite screens are even WORSE than the reviews for Ultra screens . These under $ 100 screens seem to be worth it only if you are prepared to leave it hanging down always .  
2	  I just got this camera a month ago and I am satisfied with it . It has a lot of features despite its size . And for point and shoot I can say it 's a great buy , comparable to other power packed cameras , it even takes better pictures sometimes . But I just had to give it a 4 because I thought I could do more with it . But you can't do much with the settings since it has it 's own default settings for certain conditions . But over all it 's a great camera . If you 're just after taking normal pictures and you want something sleek , this is definitely a good buy .  
1	  Cisco-Linksys WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router ( Compatible with Linux ) I bought this router because of positive reviews on amazon . It came with a CD which would not work on a MAC.I called cicso linksys and was told this model hasnt been made in years . For not much more money I am buyinga much newer model .  
1	  It looks better on my wall than with this screen . This screen is dark unless you are looking from dead-center so all those lumens you are paying for go to waste . If you are sitting in a position where the light reflects directly off a glass bead then you are going to get a " sparkle " at that spot and have to move to get rid of the artifact . I 'm not impressed and regret purchasing this screen . I 'd return it but the thing is huge and I threw out the box assuming I wouldn't need to return it . I would suggest looking further .  
1	  Indicated it would work for my Jeep , but it did not . Had to return . Thanks amazon ! Usually very happy with purchas4es but this one was a dud .  
1	  Cameta Camera is managed by morons . They cheated me in a previous sale and when I asked these idiots if these lenses could use filters , I got this dumb response : " Hi , If you 'd like to create a customized package or have any questions regarding our products , please feel free to contact us directly . Unfortunately we are not allowed to give you our phone number or direct you to another website due to Amazon policy , so you 'll have to just google " cameta camera " for our contact information . Kind Regards , Cameta Camera " HEY MORONS I DID NOT ASK YOU TO NAME ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT , I ASKED IF THEY COULD USE FILTERS AND IF SO WHAT SIZES YOU IDIOTS , IDIOTS , IDIOTS ! I hate it when people waste my time . Too bad you didn't want $ 179 from me but chose to be illogical unhelpful idiots once again .  
1	  The the fan speed control is made using voltage changes because the device doesn't have PMW . The fans working 100 percent always , doesn't matter the temperature . But the design is wonderful  
1	  I have had lots of problems with this card , and I have still not gotten it to work . I have an IBM Thinkpad , a Sony Vaio , and a Powerbook G4 . This card doesnt work in * any * of them . I have followed the instructions very carefully . An important note here : The Windows 95 instructions are downright * wrong * and make no allowances for differences in system configuration ( for example insisting that the CD-ROM be D: , as opposed to E :) . There is _ no _ installer on the CD , and Windows wasn't able to find any drivers on the disk . Linux is another story . The card does not seem to power up correctly , so the Linux kernel module cant seem to talk to it . This is probably due to the poor fit of the card in all three of my laptops . I 'll get into that in a moment . In MacOS , the card powered up ( the Powerbook has a very slick PCMCIA dock , so that doesnt surprise me at all ) . However , there are a ) no drivers and b ) it doesnt even attempt to identify itself as 99 % of the other PCMCIA cards out there do . In general , this card has been bad news , and I 'm not sure what to make of it , other than chalking it up to $ 100 down the drain . A further issue , which really prevents me from ever wanting to buy Linksys hardware in the future , is that the card just doesnt " fit " right into the VAIO or the Thinkpad ( both very mainstream , expensive laptops ) . It is necessary to push the card in so hard it feels like the antenna may break off . This is a horrible way to manufacture a product . Lastly , and mostly least , is the fact that the card comes with no case whatsoever . Because it has this huge antenna sticking out the side , it could be easily broken by leaving it in the laptop when moving the laptop around ( which you do with every other card , right ? ) . Your only choice is to continue to use the static baggie that comes with it or improvise something . Overall , the implementation and conception of this product is poor at best , and I will never buy another Linksys product again . Its a miss in three different operating systems on three different laptops .  
2	  The HP Color LaserJet 3600n is a good buy for the money . You get laser color , speed ( 17 ppm ) , networking . 2 trays all in one machine . If you want great color , don't buy a laser machine , get an inkjet instead . But if you want good color documents printed in a speedy manner for less cost than an inkjet , buy this printer . One of the real benefits of this printer is that it comes with 4 FULL toner cartridges which would normally cost over $ 500 for the cartidges alone ! The toner cartridges are all exposed when you open the cover , making installation very simple . Jams are extremely easy to remove when you have such wide access . By buying this printer , you are getting a lot of bang for your buck !  
2	  The picture is wonderful . The features are terrific . The ease of use is astounding . FYI - I 'm a James Bond fan and own a few titles . One of the movie channels had a Bond-a-thon a few days ago , so I decided to put my Philips DVD recorder to the test . I recorded one of the titles that I already own from the movie channel broadcast to my DVR . The next day , I recorded the movie from my DVR to a DVD . I then had my family watch the first 10 minutes from each movie on one of our other DVD players and , based upon picture , sound quality , etc . , tell me which one they thought was the store bought version and which one was the recorded version . My wife and all three kids picked my recording over the store bought version of the movie . Truly remarkable . The primary reason that I bought the recorder is to build upon our DVD collection without having to fork over the big $ to buy the movies from the store ( the HDMI connection and upconverting were icing on the cake ) . At $ 180 for the recorder and about $ 1 per blank DVD disc , the thing is going to pay for itself with 10 recordings and then it 's all gravy from there . Also , I travel a lot and have about 80 hours of programming on my DVR that I never seem to have enough time to watch . Now I 'll be able to burn those programs to a DVD and watch them on my laptop when I 'm on the road ! How awesome is that ? ! ? ! ? ! Five stars for the Philips DVD recorder - no doubt . I had tried a few other DVD recorders before I found this one ( including a tunerless Philips ) - for most , I had paid more and received less . For those of you with complex audio / video setups , beware of DVD recorders that don't have a built in tuner . I don't need the tuner for OTA broadcasts , I need it to make my A / V life hassle free . I 'm sure glad that I found this baby ..  
2	  This is probably the best controller for the price if you are just interested in basic controls of multiple units . I only wish it had a backlight as it is difficult to see the keys with low light .  
1	  I 've purchased this camera despite all the negative comments I 've seen on the web and decided to use it as a monitoring device for our baby 's room . Installation was a breeze and could not have been easier ( four stars for the setup of the system ) . I was a bit confused that it would not receive the DNS information via DHCP ( like all my other DHCP devices ) , but this was a minor quirk . The killer is really the video quality . In my case high frame-rates were not a requirement , but high image quality was one . The DCS-1000W failed miserably . Compression artefacts ( although it was set to lowest compression ) , fringing in higher contrast areas , blow out pictures the moment it was a bit brighter in the room and dark frames the moment it was a bit darker in the room . I was in contact with D-Link support and when they looked at the images of the camera , they told me I had a broken device . After replacement I saw the same problem again and support this time said that I should change suppliers , because my current supplier probably had a " bad batch of cameras " . Support never asked where I got my cameras from . Decided to stay away from D-Link ..  
2	  Needed a large quantity of CDs for a college course ; these did the job nicely .  
1	  In getting these earphones I was looking for something ultra-portable , easy , and good sounding . By ultra-portable I mean I want to carry them in my jeans pocket every day . While these headphones are sturdy , the sturdiness comes at a price : the case is about 1 1/4 " thick , so they don't meet my pocket-friendly requirement . These are my first experience with in-ear earphones . While they come with a wide variety of ear-piece fittings , I couldn't really find one that stayed securely in my left ear . Maybe I 've got an extra-wide ear canal . Maybe I 'm just uncomfortable jamming something in there so deep . So they aren't as easy and convenient as I wanted . When in position , they do sound great . The sound quality varies a lot if they come out of position even a little , though . For someone who doesn't have the same criteria as me , and who has had success with in-ear earphones , these could be great . But they just weren't what I was looking for .  
1	  I received the 4214 due to a 20.00 off coupon and began making coasters immediately . I never in my wildest dreams thought I could create coasters in the privacy of my home & can now die happy . To make the dream even more sweet I purchased Adaptec Easy Cd 4.1 & was making fewer coasters ( darn ) but still made some after 5 calls to Creatives answer to long distance carriers dreams ( 20 + minute hold minimum ) they agreed to replace the obviously defective unit but they insisted on sending a refurbished unit further they forced me to speak to several people in order to convince them to accept a credit card # so as to reduce my wait time ( they wanted me to return the defective unit ) wait for them to diagnose it 's malady & then after verifying that it was faulty replace it . I am convinced it is only because I have 2000.00 of their stuff that they sent me the drive without my first sending the old one back first . Now here 's the kicker the new drive they sent is a 8433E not the 8432which I had & it is not supported by the 100.00 Adaptec software I purchased due to the Nero burning rom software which came with the burner being less than good . This took numerous long distance calls to Adaptec to detirmine . so all in all I would be forced to say DO NOT BUY THIS BURNER even though now after dounloading the update for Nero to version 5.22 it does work fine . It was far too much work & when you factor the cost of the now useless Adaptec software I paid 300.00 ! DO NOT BUY THIS BURNER !  
1	  I purchased these radio walkie-talkies as a fun way of communicating with my brother , who lives 4 miles away . What the description doesn't mention is that you cannot communicate with anyone in an urban setting more than about 10 blocks away ( @ 1/4 mile ) ESPECIALLY if there are houses and hills . I 'm sure you can communicate 15 miles away if the radio signals had no landscape interference in between , but these are really worthless if you live in a city and the other walkie-talkie is more than a few buildings away . We even tried standing on the rooves of our apartments to give the radio waves a clearer shot , but that doesn't work . The batteries die within an hour and you can charge them for days and days - the batteries still only last an hour . And withing 5 minutes of using them , the battery indicator shows you that it 's already low ! Go Uniden !  
1	  I decided to replace my camcorder 's Tiffen 58mm Enhancing filter by this Tiffen 58mm Warm CPL . After I opened the filter box ( labeled 58mm ) , I found a 52mm inside . So , I immediately contacted to Amezon . com , two days later , I received another one ( excellent job , Amazon ) . But , when I opened the box , it was 52mm again . When I was ready to contact to Amazon again , I felt suspicious - the 52mm filter fit to the 58mm box really good . So , I tried to mount the 52mm filter to the 58mm filter , they fitted perfectly ( see the attached picture ) .  
2	  This is a great device and worked just as advertised . The one issue we had is that the IR extension cable did not work . Not sure if the cable is bad or something else . But , since the main unit has it 's own IR blaster on the front of it , it has worked just fine for my needs . It is pretty cool that something in the battery compartment can sense the IR being sent out of the front of the remote to then send it over the radio instead . Works like magic :) All in all a pretty cool product that works well , with the exception I mentioned above .  
2	  So previously to TiVo I would set a VCR to record my shows and many times I would miss a show due to the fact times change frequently for shows , sometimes they even add an extra minute or so a few weeks . After installing TiVo I had no problems with missing any of my shows again . I record on average about 10 + hrs of TV a week and now with TiVo I only watch about 8 because its so easy to skip the commercials and have control of what I am watching . I have this TiVo box working perfectly with my DirectTV box using the IR device . It is so easy to use that a child could pick up the remote and be working TiVo flawlessly in minutes . I would give TiVo 5 stars , but sometimes TiVo just seems a little slow for me . It has a 1-2 second pause when switching from Live mode to TiVo mode and I just wish it would go a little quicker . Nothing to cry home to mom about though .  
1	  Honestly , if I had to do it over again , I would get the MG-35 . The wireless is nice and I was able to stream an DVD . ISO to the MG-250HD from my PC without problems ( just a bit of choppiness after fast forwarding , but it went away in a few seconds ) . I 'd get the MG-35 because the WiFi is worthless for copying the DVD images to the MG350-HD ( about 2 + hours to copy one DVD . ISO file ) . So , if you are not going to be streaming from a computer , the wireless is worthless ( unless you want to use the unit as a slow NDAS device ) . It 's easy to setup . Works fine ( slide show viewing is just okay ) . The upscaling to 1080i is nice . I couldn't try the 1080p because my TV doesn't support it . The remote is fine . Some have complained about it ; however , I found it to be very intuative and the layout was fine . NDAS setup was a breeze . CON : It has to be one of the ugliest units I 've ever seen . Buggy software . _ UPDATE : If I had to do it all over again , I wouldn't buy this product at all . It started smoking and support was non existent .  
1	  They fall apart after a couple weeks - just long enough for the store return policy to go out of effect . I had a set of sony earbuds I recieved when I bought my diskman that gave out this year . So if you read between the lines ; my last set was about 9 years old and I obviously know how to care for earbuds . Then the rubber insulation started to rub off and disintegrate . Later it started to crack in other places . I called Sony Customer Service right away when the first problem appeared , but was connected with a very rude person in India who told me this was normal wear and tear and that Sony would not do anything for me . I had to persistantly request to speak with a supervisor before she would do so . The supervisor and then that person 's supervisor would not listen to me that this was a brand new set of headphones and insisted that this was due to normal wear and tear . I 'm sure they just read their responses from a provided script from Sony . Obviously , the quality of Sony products , as well as their attitude toward customers has gone downhill . I own many Sony products , but will not ever purchase another .  
2	  Having read all the reviews for this product , including some not so favorable , I decided to upgrade my wired router to wireless . Setup couldn't have been more straightforward . I didn't use the setup CD , but followed the setup guide . Within ten minutes , I was connected . The router is connected to a custom built P4 and my laptop is a Sony Vaio . I used the Linksys WPC45GS to connect my laptop to the network , another easy and flawless install . After the initial install of the router , it is strongly suggested you do the following : - Change the SSID - Disable SSID broadcast - Change password for admin access - Enable MAC filtering - Change SSID often - Use highest encryption possible - Change encryption keys oftenFor me , this router has been working flawlessly for the last week . Installation and configuration was simple . With my laptop , I can go anywhere in my 1800 sq ft . home and get a strong signal with no dropouts . Excellent product . Highly recommended .  
1	  This Transcend 2GB , 120x has not failed yet , but the Transcend 2GB 80x CF card that I purchased a month earlier failed and I lost some very important images . I was using it in my Canon 30D . I tried several different Software Recovery programs to retreive the images and none of them worked . I have tried to contact Transcend Technical Support through their website but they failed to respond . I do not recommend Transcend CF cards . This experience has taught me to pay a little more and stick with the proven brands , Sandisk , Lexar and Kingston .  
2	  After reading many reviews on this turntable , I decided to purchase one while Beach Camera was the prime Amazon partner vendor . The first unit arrived with a broken tone arm latch , and I returned it and received credit . In the meantime , Beach Camera had raised the price by $ 25 , and no other vendor was as inexpensive as my original price of $ 206 with free shipping . A call to Beach sales got me my replacement at the original price . It might be of interest to note that Audio Technica USA has a very good parts department ( I bought an extra PL120 headshell from them ) . When I called them to ask about the broken part with which my unit had arrived , they told me that it often breaks through use , that it 's easily user replaceable , that they send out several from time to time and they would be glad to send me one free of charge to replace the broken one I got . But it was too late for me to rescind the RMA I asked for and got from Beach Camera . Right out of the box , this turntable was a dream to set up and use . I experienced no problems with the minor bit of assembly necessary and took great care to balance the tone arm with the headshell and cartridge installed before setting the tracking force at 4 grams - about midway between the lightest and heaviest force AT recommends for the cartridge that comes with the unit . I never had a problem with the " zeroing " dial being too loose that some reviewers have experienced . I set the anti-skate control as AT recommends . Final leveling the turntable came next ( I did a preliminary leveling to assure I got the tonearm balance right ) , and I was very careful to repeat the process several times to assure I had it absolutely horizontal both front-to-back and side-to-side . I used a small " torpedo " level that fit on the platter , not some circular turntable level which doesn't seem to be as easy to read . I was very careful to follow the sequence for connecting the audio outputs and AC power that AT recommends . My stereo receiver ( Denon ) has a phono input , so I didn't have to switch in the built-in pre-amp . I switched on the receiver and the turntable , turned the volume up to beyond listening level and got no hum ( at least to my older ears ) that others have heard . Playing some old vinyl was a pleasure - especially with the cueing feature and damped tonearm descent . My LPs sounded as good as I remember - and I do agree with those people who prefer vinyl for its smoother music renditions , less tinny highs and deeper , more natural base notes . My only complaint was that the user manual wasn't very clear about how to use the leveling pads . I assumed that the leg lengths were , indeed , adjustable . But that should have been made very clear in the instructions . I also bought the cartridge for playing 78s but haven't installed it yet in the extra headshell I bought . I 'm hoping there is some relatively easy way to make both the 33/45 RPM cartridge assembly and the 78 RPM cartridge assembly weigh the same so I don't have to recalibrate the tonearm counterbalance every time I switch from one to the other .  
2	  I have several USB drives , and this one is my favorite . The compact size usually does not block the adjacent USB slot , although you may need to set the cap aside . The activity LED is visible from all directions , so you get feedback . I often use this in laptops or desktops other than my own , and the putrid green color is a real advantage to remind me that I need to remove it and take it with me . The cap still fits snugly after about ten months of use . I carry this in a laptop case rather than on a keychain . Keychains get a lot of banging , and I 'd rather not tempt fate . I recommend any of the Lexar Firefly models , but this one has the most obnoxious color , and is highly recommended for anyone who can be forgetful , although I can't remember who that might be .  
2	  My telescope was unbroken and had all the parts , the collimation was dead on , assembly straightforward . The EQ mount is not made well but is serviceable , the problem is it 's designed for up to a 7 pound scope the 127eq weighs 17 pounds so yes the whole assembly is shaky . ( edit ) the eq mount has two bolts at the top and at the rear , behind a plastic cap , tightening these nuts greatly improves the stability of the mount . The tripod is fine . Finderscope has a single holder bracket making it extremely difficult to line up with the telescope , I recommend buying an aftermarket finderscope or modifying the one Celestron provides . I found the eyepieces to be satisfactory even the barlow . For the price this is a great scope in my opinion , my first view of Jupiter was crisp and clear and the moons were sharp and bright . I have heard it is hard to collimate a scope of this design as it has a corrector lens at the bottom of the focuser . I have read that if you remove the focuser tube ( the silver part , take out the two screws holding the knob in place and pull it out ) then remove the retaining ring and remove the corrector lens you can collimate like a normal reflector scope . Be sure to put the lens back in the same way meaning don't flip it over and reassemble . I included that for anyone having trouble with their scope being out of collimation . I 'm glad I bought mine , now if the weather would only cooperate .  
1	  I have had two of these alarm clocks . Both of them broke after a couple of months . The first one lasted about a month , and then one morning , the alarm did not go off , causing me to be over an hour late to work . The cd just stopped working . When you hit play , it would try to spin , stop , and then the face plate would open . I returned it , and the second one broke in the same manner after two months . I returned it and bought a Sony !  
2	  After I purchased my macbook pro , I tried going to Best Buy for a case after looking at Target and Staples without any luck . Most of the ones that these stores carry have zippers that snag and scratch the laptop putting it in or taking it out of the case . After picking up a case that was too big ( a 15.4 rather than a 15 because that is all they had ) , I started looking online . A friend suggested Marware because the fit is nice and tight and you feel more secure knowing that this was specially designed for macbooks . I 've had the case for about a month now and no scratches so far .  
1	  It 's a very fast drive ! , I bought it after investigating on the Internet about very big and fast drives . I reached to the conclusion that I should buy an IBM or WD ( performance in mind ) , so I went and buy the WD ( despite of what I read in some customer reviews from other places about the reliability of the drive ) ; I was amazed with the performance of it , but after I week of use it died ( and by it i mean that the drive didn't start any more , it just make very ugly noises ) ; all data on it was LOST ! So i sent it to WD and is has been 15 days and I 'm still waiting for the replacement . If I could go back in time I would buy an IBM  
1	  I thought this might be a low cost alternative to adding a new stereo to my car in order to listen to my Ipod while driving . I wasn't expecting the world but the quality and performance of this unit are unsatisfactory . Not only is it diffibult to get a signal but the sound quality is poor . THe manufacturing of the unit itself is low , within five minutes of opening the package the front label started buckling . Save your money and get a pair of headphones instead .  
1	  I bought my Kodak CX6230 digital camera a little over a year ago and have had nothing but trouble with it . It has been sent back twice to be " fixed " and is still very inconsistent in its ability to take a picture . As I write this , Kodak is ignoring me and not responding to any of my requests for a refund or to trade the camera in for another . When I originally bought the camera I did hours of research and was pleased with all of the reviews for this camera . I knew it was in the low price range but there were no glaring reasons not to buy it . My biggest complaint is with Kodak customer service who will not take responsibility for my camera which is most likely just a fluke in their production .  
2	  This is the genuine article . You see it used in all sorts of documentaries and recording studios , and now you can take it home with you . Easily worth 5x the price and will probably last forever . This is the same hardware as the Sony MDR-V6 , which is the slightly cheaper consumer version ( non-gold plated plug and shorter warranty ) , so go for that if this costs too much . I own both and they sound identical .  
1	  This is actually a pretty good card with a really bad driver . As long as you use the Asus WL-138g driver as others have mentioned you should be fine . I would have given it 4 stars if it came with the Asus driver to begin with . Before you install this driver , I suggest you pull out the card , shut off your computer , then put it back in again . Then boot up your computer and install the driver . I got excellent test results with the Asus driver ( measured with the Road Runner speed test ) .  
1	  This flash drive has a slow file transfer speed . It takes me 2.5 minutes to transfer a + 100MB folder containing 700 files to it . I compared the same transfer with my old PNY 1G USB flash drive . It took one minute less . This means that this Kingston Flash Drive is over 50 % slower than its competitor PNY .  
2	  Delivery was prompt and everythings appears to work properly . Haven't managed to geet all my shows recorded on schedule yet , but that is not a problem of the device .  
1	  At first it was working well even if it did not process all my downloads . The setup for your computer was a little confusing . The worst part was when after about 6 months of use it broke on me . I tried to reset it called the service guys but they told me it was dead . So yes it might be cheap but it is still not worth it .  
1	  Uncompatible software , very confused instruction , bad customer service ( it is said open on Sunday but the call has no answer )  
1	  Our Sony monitor died and we had to purchase a new one . I was really happy with the Sony monitor , but decided to try another brand . Big mistake ! There is so much static with this monitor that it drives me crazy . We get woken up in the middle of the night with loud static ! It is convenient that their are two receivers , however the static does not justify the convenience . I 'm taking mine back and getting the Sony .  
2	  While the DVD is starting to go , my kids have had this TV for about 3 years . You have to be patient with the DVD player and my oldest son has realized after it hums for about 4-5minutes , it will quietly start up . The outer shell was the selling point so it 's held up and the picture quality has remained reliable too ( consistent heavy use .. and it still works fine ! )  
1	  I 've had this printer fro 2.5 years and , if I could , I would throw it out the window . Every time I try to print it makes weird noises and refuses to print . When it finally does print it leaves huge smudges of ink all over the paper so that you have to print again , wasting time , money , ink , and paper . When it does print , it prints ok , but still has blotches on the paper . DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER , IT IS SUCH A WASTE ! I wouldn't even give it one star , but the page said I had to put some rating .  
1	  I bought this used " Motorola Surfboard SB5101 Cable Modem " I used about 4 months . @ , hnever touch it when it work . But it does work now . I can't surf in internet since yesterday . I have to distrust used products on amazon . Disappointed .  
1	  This product does not work properly . Unsupervised , the sheet feeder will almost always cause a paper jam . After four and a half months of light use , a message appeared saying " Back cover open " , even though the back cover is closed . Because of this error message , the machine doesn't work any more . I am attempting to find a replacement . The machine works well otherwise , but there are many other printers that are far more efficient and reliable . Don't let favourable reviews fool you . There are basic design faults on this machine .  
1	  I returned my Tivoli PAL for the following reasons : 1 ) I wasn't blown away by the sound . I recently bought a Boston Acoustics Receptor Radio and was much more impressed with the boomy presence of that small radio . The PAL sounded much thinner . I 've read criticims of " too much bass " from the BA radio , so obviously it 's a matter of opinion . 2 ) Lack of features . No HD radio . Mono ( not a huge issue for me , actually ) . No alarm , digital readout , memory presets ( obviously ) . No switch to aux so I 'd have to plug / unplug the line everytime I wasn't to make the switch to / from my iPod . 3 ) I didn't plan to take advantage of its portability . I planned to leave this in my office , so one of the main advantages of this radio would be wasted . Returning this radio was not an easy decision because it is very cute and gets very good reception . I knew it lacked many features when I bought it . The main reason I returned it was because it lacked the rich , deep , room-filling sound I had hoped for . In the end , I just didn't think it was worth the $ 149 I paid for it . Now it 's $ 199 ? I think they used to be $ 99 . Isn't technology supposed to get cheaper over time ? There are a lot of 5 star reviews , so I 'm in the minority here . I 'd suggest listening to it before purchase if possible .  
1	  Yeah , well at first I was excited about the keyoard , the way it looked and the fact that it was wireless , but I have had problems from day one . The batteries last ok , and the set up was not very difficult , but there is a sequence of keys that causes the Logitech website to pop up in the middle of your work causing you to lose EVERYTHING > I used to type really fast ans when I made a mistake I would go back and fix just as fast , but without knowing the sequence of keys that causes this problem , I have to be super careful and type at snails pace . It 's not the keys that are used to set up your internet keys , it 's soome other way .. It 's happende during long e-mails .. , gone .. buying products at checkout .. gone .. it really [ is frustrating ] .  
2	  This is a really good GPS for outdoors ( hiking / camping ) use . It is very quick to aquire satellites and is capable of displaying MGRS coordinates for those of you in the military . Very very rugged construction . I 've dropped this thing countless times , and kept it in a lower ammo pouch on my body armor while crawling around / dropping into the prone with my full weight on it with no problems . The menu system isn't bad but definitely not the most intuitive , and entering labeling information with the on screen keyboard can be a pain . My only real complaint though is the map set it comes with is bare bones , and that 's being generous . You 'll definitely need to buy a map set micro sd card for your area and they don't come cheap .  
2	  I was looking to replace my Boston Acoustics a60 pair after about 20 years of use . I read as many reviews as I could find on the internet and also looked at Consumers Report . I kind of narrowed it down to the JBL S26 , Venturi DV62si and Polk r15 . The DV62si won the competition . I auditioned each of the speakers and found the BIC pair to have a singularly beautiful sound especially for classical and jazz ( which are my mainstays ) . I was pleasantly surprised by the bass response since CR said they were a bit " bass shy " . I recommend highly . ( I have my speakers on 12 inch stands . ) Bravo BIC .  
1	  This would have been exactly what I needed to control my case fan but it did nothing at all . I even tried buying the same controller from a different retailer and it did not work either . I tried it on my CPU fan and it had no effect . It should be plug-n-play according to the directions on the back of the package so I don't know if I am doing something wrong or not . Other than that I like the design ; the cord is very long and was able to reach from the front of my computer to the back so that I could have the controller on the outside of the case . Hope others have better luck with it ..  
1	  quick shipment . Useless product . Needed a ps / 2 to usb " signal " converter not a plain ps / 2 to usb adapter . was cheaper to just buy a new keyboard for 6 bucks .  
2	  Received item just as it was explained online . Arrived on time and quickly . Very happy with the purchase of this item and with vendor .  
1	  I installed an IBM Optical Wireless Mouse on my work pc . It seemed to work just fine until I noticed that it kept losing the Medium acceleration setting . Every few minutes the mouse started to move very slowly . To get it across the screen I had to pick it up and stroke it across a portion of my desk several times . Every time this happened I went into the mouse setup dialog and found that the acceleration had changed from Medium to None . If I re-selected Medium the mouse worked normally until the next incident . This interval of good acceleration varied from several minutes to over an hour . When I called the Mouse 's Tech Support the Tech said " Oh , that mouse doesn't support acceleration because it runs at such a high frequency " . How do you like that double-talk to excuse a piece of junk ? ! I made the mistake of buying 2 of these lousy mice . The other one I installed on my home pc and the acceleration worked fine . This mouse was installed in a PS / 2 port under Windows 2000 . This machine runs 2 operating systems . When I tried to install the mouse 's driver under Windows 98 the install routine abended . Once this happened Win98 stopped recognizing the mouse . I tried to uninstall the driver but Win98 did not seem to know anything about the driver . I switched to a plain wired un-optical PS / 2 mouse and Win98 did not recognize that mouse either . When I booted Win2K it locked up on the sign-on screen and would not recognize the keyboard or the mouse . When I forced Win2K into Safe mode it hung up the same way . I finally discovered that the only way to get Win2K to function was to unplug the mouse . At this point I went to RadioShack and bought a corded USB mouse and both Win2K and Win98 have been working ever since . I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT ANYONE PURCHASE AN IBM WIRELESS OPTICAL MOUSE !  
1	  Crashes Windows XP . Hard , ugly blue screen of death and restart crashes . Micro Innovations makes no warranty that the devices they make and sell will actually do anything other than destroy your system  
2	  i Just received my speakers today for my ipod mini . i Love it , its perfect for your room when you don't want to bother your ears with head phones or your office . i only see 2 problems , one is that the battery will have to be replaced many times or you will have to constantly charge your ipod but this problem can be solved by buying a wall adapter for the speakers . overall great product and worth the bargain , only 4 bucks ! One more great thing about it is , that it not only connects to the iPod , but nearly anything with a headphone jack ( computer , CD player , PSP , Nintendo DS , other name brand MP3 's .. Zune and anything you can think of )  
2	  We use this charger all the time and have had no problems . Very good buy !  
1	  There are some very good Amazon reviewers here doing a fine job detailing the pro 's and cons of this item , so I 'm not going to waste your time detailing the unit . I own this and two other previous generations of magellan higher end color GPSs , so I think I 'm pretty qualified to offer an opinion to my fellow GPS users . I have no axe to grind , don't work for a GPS company and just want to save my fellow explorers headache & stress . GPS units rely heavily upon firmware , techincal support , map software and map software updates . No mater how feature rich , ergonomic or well priced a GPS unit appears ( all of which has drawn me to Magellen GPSs ) , without the back-end software tools & support , the product is a failure . Magellan ( Thales ) has failed miserably providing quality in any of these areas over three generations and 4 years of products . I have spent nearly 100 hours troubleshooting their firmware update failures , searching for correct firmware , talking to them about promised map updates that never came , waiting months for warranty returned products that fail withing minutes of return , customizing PC data interfaces to insure reliability , talking to useless call centers in India .. the list goes on and on . If I wasn't a skilled and experenced network engineer / pc geek , I would have shot myself years ago due to the troubles I 've run into with Magellan GPS products . I would go out of my way to insure a friend would never buy a Magellan product , and would even go so far as insuring that my boss avoided one ( and I don't like him all that much ! ) . Look to the other GPS company for nearly trouble free products and support , becuase you will find neither with Magellan ! Nuff said ?  
1	  Right out of the box I 've noticed that my lifechat had a muffled sound ( ok ! this is a matter of taste ) and I decided to not use it much , prefering to hear my mp3s and games alike with my soundblaster speakers . But a few months ago , the leatherette earpads started to peel off showing great signs of wear and tear in spite of the headset not being used that much . I am greatly disapointed with this headset .  
1	  I have had the A80 for only 3 weeks and already the battery door is broken . In taking about 100 pictures , I was very disappointed at how slow it is to focus . Sometimes it seemed like it was 5 seconds between when I pushed the button and when it finally took the picture . Often the opportunity was long gone by the time the image was acquired . Otherwise , the pictures are ok , and I like the software that came with it . So , I 'm off to FedEx to send it for repair .  
1	  The overwhelming 5 star reviews is what helped me decide to choose this trimmer . But it 's so not worth the price . It does work on trimming hair that is more than a quarter of an inch , but if you are looking for a closer trim - this item is not for you . Positives - its sleek , and very quiet .  
1	  This product is a cheap cheap cheap cheap run of the mill product . Yea it looks cool , all digital like but really when u get it is all plastic like and the cassette player eats tapes , at least it ate my tape and the head phones are chincy and don't work and u can only get sound in one ear and they are really bad . and i would not reccomend buying this product , i would go for sumthing better .  
2	  This is my first GPS system , and it works really well . Didn't have any problems with the windshield mount . The unit powers on itself when the car starts , which is really convenient . Highly recommended !  
1	  I 'm sure small size and appearance have their merits , but above all , a product should work . To me , nothing else matters if it doesn't work , and this drive is unfathomably slow . It 's slow to the point that I 'd rather use a floppy disk . If it 's too slow to use , no one is going to find it effective . I don't think I 'm the intended customer for this product . I would never have chosen a flash drive that had the lanyard hole on the case . As another reviewer remarked , if you put a string through the hole in the case , you could lose the flash drive . The drive snaps in securely , so this is a minor point . Still , it 's poor design by Lexar . As I stated , my wife gave me this as a gift . Normally , I don't buy any electronics without thoroughly researching them . This is a $ 50 item , so I thought I 'd just use it . I 've sorely disappointed . The market may be fragmenting , and this may be targeted to youths who appreciate the many colors . But I can't imagine a youth , who will likely be moving audio , video , and photos using this drive . It 's just too slow . UPDATE : 6/26/07 : I 've been using the firefly a lot , and though it is still ghastly slow in some instances , it has performed well , especially for the money . I notice the slowless mostly when I am moving directories that contain large numbers of files or subfolders , which is common in the less expensive drives . It also seems to periodically choke on larger files . I 'm still not over the fact that it is so small and easy to lose - to easy . I think we 've reached diminishing returns on small size for jump drives . I don't want to make them any smaller , I 'm already past the point where i can keep track of it . Also , I still dislike the fact that there is no lanyard hole on the physical drive itself . I would never attach one to the flimsy plastic cover and risk losing the drive . It has been a good little drive , despite my initial complaints . However , I 'd look for something faster and sturdier in the future .  
2	  Perfect product . I play movies in my garage for all my daughter 's school friends in the summer . Just a few screws and short chains and I have a professional looking screen in the & # 34 ; Garage Theater & # 34 ; . The kids love it , and it looks great !  
2	  I have used this type of Walkman for many many years . This one I just purchased was exactly what I wanted . It arrived in a timely manner & purchase was a very simple transaction .  
1	  I agree with all the good stuff listed against this product ( model - 360 ) . I have been using this for about 6 months now ( brought it for a $ 100 more ) . But there are some major issues , because of which I would advise against buying this model . First , many places are identified by their Township names , and not city name . For example an address in the city of Collegeville , PA is identified as Upper Providence Twp , PA . Similarly for French Town , NJ it needs the township name . Township is a logical demarcation for administration ( Google that if you need more information ) , but usually addresses are specified by city name . This makes the GPS ineffective in many rural areas , not because it doesn't have that map , but because it identifies it by a different less known name . Another irritant was its identification of county roads by CR numbers , instead of road names . The biggest showstopper was its inability to find the shortest route to a destination ( it has other options but not this ) . Many times the GPS routed me through longer routes . My advice would be to go for Roadmate 760 model . When you are going to spend this amount of money , it is better to go the extra distance and get a reliable GPS , and not a toy like what I have .  
1	  I have had this router for a few years now . Where should I start ? Well , let talk about the web-based interface . It is so buggy that it does not work with Firefox . It only seems to work for Internet Explorer 6 and 7 , because it seems to tolerate broken Javascript . I would use IE if I had it , but I am a Linux user , so none of the standards-based browsers that I have will not work at all . I actually found were the bug was , but I can't do anything about . This leads to the second issue of support . I sent the issue to Belkin support , but there was never a response . Checking their support site , there is no firmware updates for this . None at all . So , here 's the scoop on what I cannot do . I cannot set any WEP keys , because buttons you need to use to apply the settings silently fail . Therefore , I cannot have a secure wireless , which makes this router useless to me . I am sure that the newer products have better support , but I think I will spend my money on a Linksys WRT54G .  
2	  This is my second one . I love it and I can type on it for hours without cramps or getting tired .. When I moved offices I left it for the new person he Loves it and I love my new ONE !  
2	  This is a great mp3 player ! The ability to expand the memory using an SD memory card was a big selling point for me . For the money , there 's nothing bad i can say about this player !  
1	  Much has been said about these headphones , so I won't go into too much detail . I did want to mention two things : 1 . I had to return these earphones because they wouldn't stay on my ears at all . I 've never had this problem with earphones before and was surprised . 2 . Another reviewer mentioned the slider that you can use to move the split point for the two headphones . It 's there and it works , but the slider doesn't work all the way down the cord .  
1	  overstated the value of 3 . quality as the Chinese counterparts . packaging - just polyethylene . when the flash has the effect of built-in flash . do not buy it .  
1	  The battery worked great for the first few months I had it . Last week I noticed when I put the battery into the charger , the charge indicator light was red , but after a few minutes , the charge light was green . However , when I put the battery into the camera , the camera indicated that the battery needed to be changed . It looks like a couple other people have had similar problems . There 's a 3 year warranty on this battery , so I emailed Lenmar to ask if I could get a replacement . Lenmar responded quickly , providing me with a return authorization number and detailed information on their warranty policy . However , since my battery was purchased more than 90 days ago , there 's a $ 7.50 shipping and handling charge for the new battery . Since I only paid $ 12 for the battery itself , I didn't think it was worth the trouble to get a replacement , especially since I could run into the same problem with the replacement . Anyway , I think it 'd be wise to spend the extra bucks for the Canon battery .  
2	  # - # - # - [ Why this rating ? ] - # - # - # Some 2 years ago , when I bought my HV20 , I did a lot of research on tapes , and the consensus overwhelmingly pointed to the Panasonic AMQ family . So far , with over 50 tapes used , I am a happy camper indeed - no dropouts , and great quality . I am a true believer now , and hence the 5-star " I Love It ! " rating . # - # - # - [ Tape Types ] - # - # - # Irrespective of the tape you decide to use , I learned that it was more important to be loyal to the type of lubricant used - referred to by my friends as wet or dry tapes . The Panasonic belongs to the dry type family , whereas Sony tapes use a wet lubricant . For instance , Panasonic claims that this tape uses a " .. dry type lubricant [ that ] causes less video head wear ( - 4m after 500H ) . It also prevents head clogs and extends head life . " While some on the ' net argue that this distinction is an urban myth - I decided to trust my professional friends on this issue . This difference is not material until you switch between the two types - which can lead to clogged video heads . # - # - # - [ Archival ] - # - # - # I rely very heavily on tape as an archival mechanism for all my HD masters . Hence my decision to go with the AMQ series over the PQ series ( which are a bit cheaper ) . Happy Recording ! - Damodar  
2	  This Sima SCC works great . Can sharpen a DVD picture to make it look better than the original ! I 've seen were some people stated that it will only work from DVD to VCR .. but that 's not true . You have to " trick " your DVD Recorder by going through a S-VHS VCR inputs ( S-jacks ) then outputs to your DVD Recorder . Connect the Sima SCC Video Color Corrector to the DVD player BEFORE going through a S-VHS VCR input S-Jacks & then the output S-jacks to the DVD Recorder , then it works GREAT ! Will make a better picture than the original . You just got to know what your doing ! Better than the new Sima products if you use it correctly .  
2	  I use mine for other pictures as well as i-zone pictures . If used correctly , it works pretty well . Plus I can upload it on my computer and send pictures via email and put on my homepage . It cost much less than a full-size scanner and is pretty flexible . Check out [ .. ] for all the uses .  
1	  I had a high trust in linksys routers as my previous one worked well for 5 years w / o a glitch . This one was bought half a year ago and broke down recently , it either has no warranty or it is extremely hard to find the information . It is probably not worth fixing .  
2	  I have used generic inks and the colors just aren't as vibrant as the real deal .  
2	  I have used an MP3 player with headphones for my workouts for several years now . I cannot use ear bud types because they just fall out when I move . I don't want to buy expensive over the ear headphones just to sweat all over them but quality inexpensive over the ear headphones seemed impossible to find . The Koss SportaPro is the best choice I have made yet at under 30 dollars . They sound great and the band style along with the pivoting ear pieces keeps them in place . The band pivots for the behind-the-head or over-the-head style . I find the behind-the-head to be a little awkward , probably because I am not used to it , but they do stay in place , which is great for push-ups . I have read that some find them to be ugly but I could care less what they look like and frankly cannot understand that criticism . I highly recommend these headphones for anyone that needs headphones while exercising or any activity .  
1	  I have had this printer for 3 years , and when it works it does just fine .. When It Works .. rarely ! I consistantly get an error msg stating my paper is jammed when it clearly is not , it resets and resets and resetsover an over and over again when all I want it to do is scan or print or copy . The ink is expensive and when itdoes manage to work it is so loud and clunky that it shakes my whole desk . I cant wait to find another printerthat actually works , when I do , I honestly will throw this one out of the window !  
1	  Although I would really like to give this stand three stars , I can't give it any more than two . The stand is beautiful , sturdy and does a good job of holding your laptop . Great . It contains a cable routing hole in the rear to keep cables neat . Smart . That said , this product suffers from a single major design flaw that just can't be overlooked : The cable routing hole is too small to accommodate the DVI plug from an apple Cinema display , despite the fact that the stand is shown * right next to * an apple cinema display in the product 's retail packaging . FAIL.Fail . Fail . Fail . Did rain design not try to plug this into a single laptop accompanied by a Cinema Display before taking the design to the manufacturing step ? Incredible . Sure , you can bypass the hole for the cinema display plug , but then what 's the point in having the cable routing in the first place ?  
1	  Two weeks out of the box , the drive starting making clicking / scratching noises .. diagnostic programs say it fails surface scan .. looks like a major mechanism error .. I just hope I can get IBM to replace it ..  
2	  I have tried 4 different FM Modulators ( Transmitters ) to use with my I-pod , and this is the first that could transmit ' strong ' enough for living in Boston . In fact , this unit is so strong , that you can broadcast over a station that has faint music , something I found the I-trip , the I-tunes , and a whole host of other units couldn't do . Remember though , it still won't be as good as CD quality . With the other units I tried , I could get the music to work for a while , but as soon as I drove just a little ways , I would have to find a ' cleaner ' ( more static ) station - even just a hint of reception would throw the music off .  
1	  this modem is a piece of junk i cant give it . 5 of a star or i would buy a motorola  
2	  I bought mine 7 years ago and never had any issues until now . It doesn't play any DVDs anymore but what can you expect after so many years and I did use it a lot because I like to watch movies that have a different region which Cyper Home is the only brand that I can find that will play DVDs from other countries . Yes the remode has small buttons but that is not the end of the world . going to order another one today and can't wait .  
2	  This product has exceeded my expectations . It increased my bandwidth from 12mbps to 16mbps and decreased my latency from 200ms to 26ms ( On a 9 year old router , haven't hooked up the new one yet ) . It was also extremely easy to set up .  
1	  I bought this cable to hook up my external hard drive to my laptop and it sucks for video transfer . Everything skips and loads so slow I can't watch anything . Might be ok for basic file transfer but sucks for media . The only reason I kept it was as a last resort for basic file transfers .  
1	  I order a code online so i dont have to go to the store . It is ridiculous that I have to wait for a code when i ordered one five seconds before and i go it right away .  
2	  This unit must have a hole drilled through the bottom of your boat . Make sure your boar does not have any brace or any type of re-enforcment in the area you are drilling . The unit makes it easy to keep the transducer level when you are installing . Use care in cutting the plastic block keep it very smooth and use a good type sealant both outside and inside of the boat . The unit works fine .  
1	  I bought the Bling-bling Black . What can I say ? I love the sound . Crisp clear highs and midrange and the low deep rich bass . The construction ? HATED IT ! Where the cord comes out of the plug is the major weak spot and is not compatible with an active lifestyle . The connection where the plug meets the cord allows for too much movement at the joint hense the wire connection breaks inside the insulation . Results either the right or left plug stops working or both . In my case it was always the right plug . This is my 5th pair of headphones in less than a year . Every single pair died within a few months of purchase . You 'd think for the price you pay for them , there 'd be sturdier concstruction an active lifestyle . and hold up to V-Moda really needs to rethink this design flaw . Overall my rating is 5 stars for sound and 2 for construction .  
2	  This battery works so much better and is so much longer lasting than the off-brand , cheaper ones I have tried . You pay more for the brand-name , but it 's worth it . I have two off-brand batteries that are now at the end of their life-cycle , and I haven't had them for as long as my original Lumix battery . Needless to say , I purchased a Lumix replacement .  
1	  I thought this one a good purchase . It is a DVD reader , But can't play a vulgar DVD ! You have to spend additional 25 $ to buy a Nero software upgrade to be able to see a vulgar 12 $ DVD ! Beware of this little aspect . I would not buy any other DVD reader for a PC unless I 'm assured of this .  
1	  I had read reviews of this enclosure that stated the power supply was insufficient for large drives . Since I was only going to put a 5400 rpm drive into the Macally G-S350SUA I figured there would be no problem . Hey , I had had pretty good luck with Macally stuff before , and it was such an attractive enclosure . Wow , was I gonged . Within a week of inserting my Samsung 1.5 Tb drive into this enclosure , the drive didn't show up on the desktop . The only way I could remount the drive upon the desktop was to disengage the firewire cable while the drive was active , and I can't believe that does much for the integrity of the data . I had thrown away the packaging and thus couldn't return it to Amazon , so since it was certainly under warranty I contacted Macally . No , to be accurate I tried to contact Macally . They did not respond to emails or phone calls . Now I have a worthless piece of junk that was sold to me by a bottom-feeder company . I 'm sure the enclosure would work fine for a 200 gig or even a 500 gig hard drive but the 2 amp power supply is unable to reliably power a drive larger than that . Since terrabyte drives are now common this enclosure is junk . There is no warning in any of the Macally ads telling us consumers that it is incapable of powering larger drives . I feel like I 've been fleeced by what was once a decent company . Using this enclosure with a large drive ( 1 Tb or greater ) is a crap shoot and soon enough you 're gonna roll snake eyes . Underpowered enclosure but what is worse is the total lack of customer service . They didn't argue with me , they didn't try to placate me , they didn't offer satisfaction - The Company simply DID NOT RESPOND to repeated emails and attempted calls . I would rate them 0 stars if I could .  
2	  I am a home theatre snob with over $ 10k in gear and cabling for my single viewing / listening room . That said , I use a $ 149 Oppo to watch DVDs . The picture quality is absolutely excellent ( especially after you calibrate your display properly using a calibration DVD like Digital Video Essentials ) and at this unheard-of price it still comes with a high quality ( not some junky spaghetti-gauge ) HDMI cable . I have no idea how they sell a player this good for this price , but you absolutely , positively cannot go wrong . Months of service and not a single complaint regarding reliability or performance .  
1	  It took a couple of calls to technical support to configure the DI-713 router to work with my XP laptop and to tie it into Sprint Broadband . After a couple of frustrating days , it worked fine . Now , three weeks later , it has stopped working with the internet . After calling technical support , it appears that the router is no longer recognizing the WAN port , so I have to send it back for repairs .  
1	  the overall quality of this kit is pretty low . it will get the job done but the power cable , ground cable , and speaker wire are almost as cheap as they come . the terminals supplied with the kit are poorly sized for most of the functions they 're meant for , much like the gromets and seals . the rca cable offers little more shielding than one you would use on a dvd player . on a positive note , the zip ties and wire cover were very handy for making my above carpet wiring less noticable .  
2	  This item works well . We were hoping each mailbox could have it 's own greeting but will work with just the two greetings  
1	  This cable is really awful . It is much skinnier than I expected ( I should have known given the price ) . With a cable this long , you lose way too much quality with such a low gauge cable . Video quality is really awful . I used this to connect my digital antenna to my HD projector , and a very blurry picture was produced . I cannot imagine using this ; I got a higher gauge cable immediately and everything looked great . I should have known the price was too good to be true , but it really is . If you need a really long cable with a fuzzy picture , this is your product . I can't imagine that use , but maybe it 's for someone .  
1	  Quite possibly one of the worst wireless routers every produced . It lacks features that routers much older than it possess such as the ability to reserve addresses for DHCP ( just hope you get lucky , I guess ) and many others . Secondly , it is a terrible router for any computers running Windows XP or Windows Vista . Not only does it not have any ability whatsoever to reconnect commputers from standby or hibernate ( a common problem in wireless networking ) , it can't even keep computers that are running 100 % of the time connected . Apparently , its DHCP implementation does not match up with all of the other wireless routers out there . Apparently just to ensure that not only is the Trendnet wireless router upon arrival , but that it will continue to be for all time to come , the firmware " upgrade " on the Trendnet website has a newer version number on the website , but installing it on the wireless router does not update either the version number or the date . There is a reason you can get good deals on these all of the time . Anyone who spends any time in networking knows they are junk and so , the only way they can hope to sell them is by dumping them at bargain prices with rebates to unsuspecting users who aren't aware that this wireless router is useless for pretty much any network .  
2	  To begin , I have to question the negative reviews on this keyboard . I have large hands , and there is only so much typing one wants to do with the Treo keyboard . I bought this in person at the official Palm store in Sunnyvale . At the time of purchase , the store clerk warned me that the downloadable drivers ( November 2005 ) for the Treo were back-level , and he beamed me the driver directly from another Treo 650 . I 've had no problems at all since then . I suspect that some of the negative experiences were driver issues , but who knows ? The construction seems solid , and it opens and closes easily after a couple of tries . Seems up to most rough-and-tumble knocking around in a briefcase , unless one is also carrying a three-pound hammer . Very compact for a full keyboard . As others have noted , when you need characters past the basic alphabet , numbers , and primary punctuation symbols , it can be a bit fiddly . The 18mm spacing for the alpha keys is adequate . The number row is slightly shorter than the primary three rows , but that has not been a problem for me . This is very useful when writing emails while traveling . I have never tried to balance it on one knee - another review complained about that , but it works OK for me with two knees . As I tend to use it on a restaurant table or seatback tray , this is not a problem . YMMV.I obviously cannot speak to how well it will work with other Palms . I recommend it highly for Treo users . Keep your IR port clean and make sure it is clearly visible within the case if you use one . I found two issues with the keyboard . First , it tends to use batteries at a fair rate , so stock up on AAs and buy stock in the battery company . Second .. I lost my Treo 650 recently and replaced it with a 680 .. and discovered that the Palm web site does not list this keyboard as supported for the 680 . So I thought I would be stuck with getting a more expensive Bluetooth replacement . ( Insert sad face here . ) However , I downloaded the most recent driver from the Palm support site , et voila - if you will pardon my French - it works . So this issue is much less severe than I originally feared . Recommended .  
1	  Product shipped slow , unpackaged and it was used . Came with instructions hooked up per instructions and nothing . Tried 4 times to get porduct to work . Now they are sitting in the bow on a shelf . Just pissed away the money .  
2	  Carl Zeiss Victory FL Binoculars ( 8x32 ) After purchase I compared these , at leisure , to Leica Geovid 8x42 first and second generation , Leica 8x32 BA , Zeiss 7x42 , and Swarovski 10x42 EL , among others . Amazing . Virtually the same field of view as the geovids and actually look brighter . In low light , it was very close . The only binocs that might be better than these for low light were the ELs . I did not expect these 8x32s to be competitive with a size larger binocs . If I just wanted to look , and didn't care about ranging , I 'd leave the bigger glass home , unless I wanted the unmatched fov of the 7x42 Ziess , or the detail offered in the 10x42 EL . Both those sets of glass stand up to , or offer some advantage over , this newer Zeiss 8x32 . On the other hand , I was surprised at how close my not-brand-new Leica 8x32s were . And how thin was the eye relief advantage of the new Zeiss ' over them . ( I wear glasses , and I selected these from the similar offerings by Leica and Swarovski based largely on eye relief . ) My Leica 8x32s were half the price of these perhaps 5-7 years ago . Exchange rate changes , perhaps . Seems all the new premium binocs are around 2m . Based on this experience , they might all be perceptibly better than the same top of the line stuff from a few years back . And here I 'm fully stocked with those . Ugh . Highly recommended .  
2	  This is my first tiffen filter and I am planning to keep buying from this manufacturer . Affordable price and delivers quality colors .  
1	  Unfortunately , the great idea here to combine pen and pen drive lacks , as a previous reviewer said , durability . My flash housing separated from the body of the pen and the actual pen portion stopped working months ago .. all in all a bit of a dissapointment  
2	  This was relativel easy purchase to make .. the seller described the adapter ring well .. sometimes it is difficult to determine the correct size and how the threads are situated but this seller did a good job describing the product .. worked perfectly ..  
2	  The m125 is deffientally worth it 's wieght in gold . At my middle school , there has been a Palm Pilot craze , and at the same time , I found myself wishing for something to help me keep organized . I tried a paper panner , but it was too bulky and heavy to carry around all day . I was just looking for a simple Palm Pilot and found the m125 . It was PERFECT ! I love the m125 ! It is perfect for 13 - year olds like me who just need something simple and nothing too fancy . The m125 is what I found to be a wonderful Palm Pilot . It has lots of expansion cards and I bought a games one , an eBooks card , and the E-mail expansion . I also like the m125 because of it 's size and price . I can tuck my m125 in my binder and carry it around with me . And I found it to be one of the cheepest , best working Palm Pilots i 've ever seen . But one thing , the batteries run out really quickly ( like anywhere from 4 days to one week ) , and my family is getting tired of our battery " bill " . But overall , if you need a small , compact Palm Pilot , then this is you " Ticket " . I highly reccmond getting a m125 !  
2	  NO more laying awake in bed listening to the ball game ! Now my husband can enjoy his late night sports and I can get some sleep ! He says the sound is very clear , and you can adjust for static if necessary . I should have bought these headphones 10 years ago ! Great investment !  
1	  Okay , first off , I loved this product ! It worked , for the most part , flawlessly and I was able to enjoy my ipod everywhere . However , after about 6 months of enjoyment , it broke ! So I bought another one and a few months later , it broke too ! I tried using the support page online and that didn't work either . So now I am sad because I can no longer utilize my ipod to its fullest extent . I have thought about buying another one because it is one of the cheapest transmitters out there , but I hesitate because they just don't last .  
1	  These are supposed to be good-fit earphones , but between sweating and having small ears , they don't fit at all . Not a good choice for the gym , or indeed if you are moving around at all . A real disappointment .  
1	  Bought it late January , 2011 , and it died this afternoon . When the original Sony light bulb dies , the screen get darker , and status light turn red . Not this one . I hear a loud pop , and the screen turn dark . Right after , the TV speaker start making some high pitch , loud squeaking sound . Very , very scary . I immediately turn off the TV and unplug from the outlet . To be honest , I don't yet know if my TV is also damaged by this blow , will see . I have uploaded the image of the shattered light bulb above . See for yourself . One unrelated note : for people posting that installation is easy and give this product a five star , it 's kind of doing a disservice to other users . Of course it is easy to install . That 's by design of the TV , not this product . I was fooled by the high mark of this product . After carefully read through all the review , most five stars are coming from " easy to install " , and all the 1 star come from " die young " . Kind of ridiculous , isn't it ?  
1	  NO FLASH WITH A TYPE OF CAMERA THAT NEEDS ALL THE LIGHT IT CAN GET ?  
1	  I purchased this router in January 2007 , and by May 2007 it had stopped working . It began ' freezing up ' on me after a couple of months , and frequently had to be reset by disconnecting & reconnecting the power cord . Even the hard-wired ports would not work when it would freeze up . I called the D-Link customer support line , and after an hour on the phone convincing them that the router just didn't work , they agreed it was defective . Their only solution is for me to mail the router back to them AT MY COST and wait for them to test it and analyze it there , determine whether they think it 's truly defective , and wait for them to mail me a replacement . If they manage to get it working on their end , they can charge me a 10 % restocking fee and send it back to me . I find it appalling that I have to pay to send back to the manufacturer a defective piece of merchandise . I work from home , and without my router , I 'm out of the water . I need a replacement and I need it now . D-Link resolutely refuses to refund anyone their money for defective merchandise . I 'll never buy anything made by D-Link ever again .  
2	  There 's really not much to review but I figured I would counter the other ( misguided ) review on this item . The charger works just as fine for powering the Zune while in the car . I pretty much leave my Zune in the car and this lets me do that without having to periodically bring it inside for charging . The part that goes into the cigarette lighter is rather large so take that into account if you have any kind of obstructions around your power socket . The only other thing I noticed that surprized me a little was that the Zune display stays on when connected to the charger and playing music . There 's nothing really wrong with that but I was just expecting the screen to go dark like it does when it is not connected to power . Oh , I also like the coiled cord which makes things a bit tidier than having a lot of loose cable cluttering up the console area . I recommend this product .  
1	  Hi , At first it seemed to work but shortly after It seemed to stop working , commercials are as loud as ever . Hope they will give me a new one to try !  
2	  This is a very helpfull screen protector .. it really protects the screen from glares and scratches . Its pretty simple , but I had some problems installing it to my Dell Axim x51 , since the screen protector is much more bigger than the screen , so you must " force " it in order to make it perfectly fit , or you could also try to cut the screen protector so it could fit without having to use the " brute force " . It does it work , though , for such a cheap price , but sorry I can't give it a 5 stars , since the installation could be a little bit hard because of its size .. which could cause the glue it has to get lost and leave bubbles on the corners of the screen , which happened to mine .  
1	  The seller refused to fulfill my purchase because the seller did not want to stand by the price at which the item was offered for sale . I received an automated message from Amazon indicating that the seller cancelled my purchase , and my purchase price was refunded . I would not recommend doing business with this seller .  
2	  I can't believe how inexpensive this cable was . My husband had bought a 6 ft cable at a local big box electronics store , and it was $ 26 . I found this online , bought it and took back the other one that we hadn't opened yet . He tried it out last week using it between his iPad ( with the converter of course ) and the TV at his hotel . He was really impressed with how well it worked .  
1	  My daughter recieved her Flip Mino less than a year ago as a gift from her boyfriend . She took it with her on her 2 week exchange trip to England . She had been looking forward to this trip for a year . Her best friend took the stills , she was taking the video . During the trip the camera stopped working and wouldn't turn on . Nothing she could do while she was there . When she got back we called Flip , it was under warranty . they had us try resetting and then plugging it into the computer overnight . When none of that worked they accessed the camera remotely and determined that it had a defective battery . So it needed to be sent back ( at my expense ) I sent it priority mail on a Saturday , it was in their hands that Monday morning . It took them all week to actually post that they received it . Every time I called they had no answers as to where the camera was or what was happening with it . Since it was a special order design they were supposed to call to confirm the design and order the new one . They never did . After 2 weeks of and repeatedly calling with increasing frustration and my obvious annoyance with them , they ordered a replacement and said they would escalate the order and priority ship it next day air . They said 24-48 hours to process . Well it 's now 3 days and they issued a shipping label and it 's not in the hands of UPS , so technically not shipped yet and it 's listed as Ground ! We also just received an email that video retrieval was unsuccessful . It was a battery failure , they said they could retrieve the video . I think they lost the camera ! My daughter just had a competition that we didn't have the camera for and we are leaving for another and we still don't have it . That 's 2 competitions we are missing being able to tape . I also have no faith in the camera 's reliability . I have no faith in Cisco , they lie , they don't do what they say they 'll do and they need to work on their customer service .. its TERRIBLE ! 2 weeks and still don't have the replacement and still have not received a phone call back .  
2	  Bought this cartridge to replace an old Shure R25 EDT which was sold by Radio Shack more than 30 + years ago . My old Pioneer PL-100 turntable which also became nonfunctional was replaced by a Pyle PLTT-B1 purchased several weeks ago from Amazon . I always wanted to go back to a cartridge with a more warmer and balanced sound . This Shure cartridge surely brings back memories of the older cartridge it now replaces . The Audio Technica cartridge that came with the Pyle turntable while adequate simply does not recreate music the way it should be heard . If you look at the Shure product line , you came see that they have been in business a really long time and know how to do things right . Actually , it is good to have different brands of cartridges since all vinyl records are not all sonically and structurally alike .  
1	  The power constantly flickers on and off . The buttons don't always work . And it 's very difficult to find a station . Usually doesn't work .  
2	  This cable is the real thing in terms of quality , construction and durability . The other cheaper cables fell apart while this one keeps strong ! I use it every day in a classroom and I love it . Highly recommend !  
2	  These cartridges work perfectly in our Canon printer and having two of each means we 've got enough ink to print out even more before having to purchase more . Great price , great product .  
2	  I 've had this little device now for maybe 3 years , upgraded from the starter h1915 ( don't laugh , it was good for its time ) . All I can say is I 'm always amazed by the hx2415 's versatility . I keep up with hundreds of documents with it , something that would be a tree 's nightmare 10 years ago ; and it doesn't miss a beat when opening any of them . Being able to quickly and easily access WAPs is definitely its best feature . I usually can find myself jumping on the ' net to look up something ( many times to prove someone wrong ) , and while it does take WiFi a bit to come " online " , once it does it 's only a matter of bringing up internet exploder and I 'm off ! Not to mention the gaming capability .. and being able to watch full DVDs ( with the appropriate purchased software ) with stunning clarity ! The only negative I can offer is the 64MB of RAM / ROM . While the unit can handle most app memory requirements pretty well , there are some memory hogs that make me wish I had waited for the more beefier 128MB model . This is still far superior to many , though . It 's a hand-held entertainment system ( can't wait for my 16 GB CF Card to arrive ) .  
2	  This amazing new product literally changed my life . As a parent , I carry it around with me all the time , because you never know when you might want to capture a cute , funny moment . It 's the size of an iPod , so I can easily pull it out to shoot videos of my baby on a moment 's notice . It turns on and starts recording in an instant , zooms in & out , and shoots very high-quality video . The best part is how easy it is to share videos via the web . The camcorder has a USB arm that pops right up and can be inserted directly into your computer . You don't even have to install software because it all runs right off of this nifty little device . Once you open the interface , you can email videos privately to family and friends , which is a great way to stay connected . I 've also edited videos , added music and posted my footage directly to YouTube right off the camcorder . It has a cool way to make musical montages by combining mutlple clips into one highlight video . My Sony camcorder literally just sits in my clost because it 's never accessible for unplanned moments . Also , trying to edit & email those videos was a nightmare . Now , I use my Flip Video camcorder instead . Because it 's so easy to use , I 've noticed that I now shoot video instead of photos a lot of the time . I honestly never knew video could be so much fun . A must buy .  
2	  These are really nice earphones for the price . The quality doesn't disappoint if you just use it for leisure . I handled it quite roughly but it worked fine . The cushions on the earphones might fall apart though if you don't keep it safely . All said , highly recommended for the price . - Nikhil  
2	  I can't say enough for this it gave me the length I needed for the computer and my printer . Thanks again  
2	  This filter works great for black and white photography and is at a portion of the cost of many other brands yellow glass filters .  
1	  Like one of the other reviewers , I bought the Canon after a Visioneer USB scanner failed to work with my laptop . The Canon was easy to set up , and it does look great , but the scans are terrible . They have a reddish hue and are very blurry . Forty-five minutes with tech support did not lead to a resolution . I 'm hoping to cut my losses and send it back . I 've heard of several reports of incompatibility with Win98 but in my case this problem was not readily correctable .  
2	  I am a pro wedding photographer . I 've had a pair of these since 2006 and could not be happier . I did quite a bit of research , not just online , but in the field . I rented various models of pro offerings from Canon and Nikon . I attended " rep " days at my local camera store so I could grill the Nikon and Canon reps for answers to the questions that were not covered in the marketing materials or online reviews . I wanted a professional camera set up , but ended up with the pro-sumer 5D from Canon . Here are the factors that finally made my decision ; 1 ) Performance : It must possess a fast enough ISO to capture clean low light images . It must have enough processor mettle to keep up with fast paced shooting . Any processor lag is not acceptable . It must produce file quality and size that delivers professional quality images to my clients . It must be durable enough to withstand the inherent bumps , dust and inclement weather I encounter during the course of a wedding . It must work perfectly with professional quality lenses , flashes and batteries . 2 ) Size / WeightI have small hands and not a huge amount of forearm strength . I needed an ergonomic set-up that I could carry continuously for 8-10 hours without needing to take up a special exercise routine that would give me Pop-eye arms . Granted , there were " better " cameras , but they were weighed down with additional features that I didn't want or need . I needed a lighter camera with standard and well placed controls that I can change and adapt from moment to moment without needing to scroll through lots of options . My biggest complaint about the 5D was the lack of weather seals and dust management , but these issues turned out to be minor . I don't change lenses that often and I clean the sensors before every job . This has kept the dust to a minimum . Overall , I have been very satisfied with the 5D and would not hesitate to recommend it to sports and wedding photographers . It is a fast and lightweight camera that produces nice large image files .  
2	  This case has lasted a few years with no real signs of wear . I recommend it .  
2	  Left it on the window sill for a few days until I needed it and it worked perfectly . A little slower to charge up the Kindle than if I had plugged the Kindle into the wall but the Solio will be great while traveling , during a power outage , or when I 'm camping in the woods . Funny little instruction sheet with almost no writing and lots of pictures . Once I mastered the art of deciphering the pictures , it worked well for powering my original Kindle . FYI , I had to purchase a special connector tip for the Kindle 1 ; I believe that one of the tips that came with the Solio would have worked for the Kindle 2 . No matter because Solio has ba-jillions of tips on their website for almost every phone and device .  
1	  From the description , this printer adapter sounded like it would work . However , I was wrong . Probably my fault but be careful to make sure your system is compatible before purchasing . Good news is , Amazon made it easy to return .  
1	  I bought Coolpix 4300 two months after I had bought Canon Powershot S400 . Reason for two ? It was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid . The two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing . I 've had no problem with Canon whatsoever . With Nikon , althoughpicture qualities are as good as any other 4 MP cameras , I 've had the following headaches ; 1 . Pictures won't transfer to PC directly from the camera using the included transfer cable . I did everything I could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to PC is with the card reader . Card reader is included . 2 . The speed is noticeably slower than Canon , especially so with flashes on . 3 . With low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip . I used Lexar 256 MB and I still use it which means nothing is wrong with Lexar . Be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .  
1	  Quite happy with with the quality of the picture . My bulb lasted 370 hours . Disappointing for an item that claims a bulb life of 2000-3000 hours ! Tech support is fairly open about the nature ( .. ) : bulbs start to grow dim at about 300 hours , dying well before their box specs ; replacement lamps average ( .. ) . Someday some bright soul on the internet will find a way to replace the mercury vapor bulb within the lamp for a few dollars , rather than the whole lamp for a few hundred , but until then I would urge buyers to avoid this knockoff of the higher-quality , name-brand DLP projectors . Alas , I have learned the hard way that you get what you pay for .  
1	  Do not waste your time . The Tungsten E is almost useless . The set up was terrible . Tech support took 3 calls and hot synch is still not correct . The battery is almost non-existent ; after full charging it will " magically " dissipate without ANY use . Then the fun really begins - ALL my data is then lost - this has happened 4 times in the first 30 days of owning this . Oh yeah - when hot synch does work ( rarely ) it requires COMPLETE resetting of the entire unit ! The Vx I had for 4 yrs was perfect . The Tungsten E gets an E- instead of an F- because the screen lights up nicely ( for a short while ! ) . Heh Palm - get tech support personnel who are willing to take the time and not rush you off the line . I 'll never buy Palm again .  
1	  Great until one day it just stopped working . In less than1 year , these headphones just died on me .  
1	  I noticed that a bunch of people recently had issues with their Sennheiser 's quality , but I hoped I those were the exceptions . I guess not . My headset arrived factory sealed ( and on time ) , but after close to an hour of fiddling with it I determined that yep , the mic was broken . You can hear a buzz when it 's on , and that buzz disappears when you click the mute switch . And sometimes you can barely make out your voice coming through . Barely . I tried my wife 's El Cheapo headset and that worked fine in the same jacks , so yes , the Sennheisers were bad . Judging from the timeline of good vs . bad reviews , it seems the bad reviews are also the more recent ones . Whatever the reason , I 'd shy away from these .  
1	  I have a Dell Insperon Notebook and can not detect the PCMCIA card much less the compact flash in it . This could be an error on my end but after several hours of trouble shooting I can not help but think that this card just doesn't work . I would not recommend this product .  
1	  What a disappointment when Christmas morning my son started to set up the Ceiva 3 only to find that it would cost another 159.95 per year to make it work . We went back to the box looking in disbelief that we had missed this important information . BUT THE ADDITIONAL COST IS NO WHERE TO BE FOUND . It says " free " but no mention of the additional 99.95 to 159.95 needed to use their product . Such deception should not be allowed by companies who use Amazon to sell their products . We are sending this item back . If they deceived us once , how can they be trusted ? Shame on Ceiva ! I will never again fail to read the reviews BEFORE I BUY .  
1	  Ordered these to fix sound clipping coming from Nintendo Wii into Sony TV ( Wega KV-30HS420 ) ( input was at too high level ) These caused additional distortion even when tested on connections that were already working perfectly . They 're in the trash now ; not worth the money to send them back . I haven't tried the more expensive Harrison Labs ones . My final solution was to bypass the TV entirely and go directly to the surround sound receiver , which handles the higher level inputs just fine . But .. I don't always want to turn on the big receiver :-/ oh well .  
2	  I had an 18 foot diameter intex , it lasted four years in florida sun , which is pretty amazing for any plastic thing . I liked that one the best , once I got rid of the crappy ladder that came with it - swipe some water on the top ring and just slither over the top , works much better than a ladder , plus it 's an automatic child guard - no way for tiny person to climb in alone . Once filled it 's like a kettle , and the water pressure holds it rigid ; even while the inflatable top ring sun-rotted the water stayed in pretty much . The tricky thing with that kind is having no slope at all , otherwise after a hard florida rain it overtops and the low side flips out and you get a flood that digs the ground even lower right there ( it 's sand not dirt here ) , but then once it equalizes it flips right back up and sits there looking innocent . I did get the chlorine generator , so very low maintenance and no adding chemicals , just cleaned filter once a week and vacuumed a few times a year . The hoses do tend to rot , I think it 's a combination of sun damage , salt , and the chlorine that 's generated . Advantage is you can run the generator longer or shorter to adjust the amount of chlorine , but it was never nasty strong like chlorine dumped in from a bottle or tablet . I 'm remodeling but once things are settled again I 'll get another one of these . No room in the yard right now , plus stray nails might puncture it , so a little snapset pool will have to tide me over . I might investigate trying to use a pvc pipe instead of the hoses , for durability , if I can find the right connectors . All in all it depends what you want , swimming I 'd get large quickset , just cooling off while sunbathing I 'd get small snapset . Having dogs , I wouldn't get inflatable .  
2	  They are great for their price .. Sound quality is excellent .. the only problem i faced since buying them 2 month ago is that i am losing the bits without any reason :( they are still working but it hurts a bit to use them without their bits ..  
2	  These switches are perfect , the wire IS the right size for its amp rating and I have no problem getting the plugs on and off . I read a punch of negative things and still bought 4 for my car alarm install . They are perfect .  
1	  I have had this drive for over a year now . At first it seemed okay , but the software that comes with it does not work well , the drive itself spends more time frozen than functioning , and the website has not been a helpful place for information . Before I realized what a problem this drive is I got one for my mom , too . She 's having the same problems . I am researching other backup drives but will not even consider getting anything from Western Digital .  
1	  My wife and I bought this camera two years ago , before our first child was born . We 've been very happy with its performance , and found the picture quality much better than other cameras . In the last few months , however , the camera no longer accepts new rolls of APS film . Instead , it changes the cartridge from " new roll " to " exposed , " without taking any pictures . We brought this camera to the camera shop , and they told us that it was a common problem with this model , and that it would cost [ a lot ] to have it repaired . We then called Canon , and they did not admit or deny the history of this problem . They just told us that the new Z3 did not seem to have the same issues . Overall , we really like this camera . We 're probably going to try the Z3 , however , for our next camera . ..  
1	  Purchased the product in order to run a game system and my cable system through one optical audio input on my receiver . Tried all inputs on the device , tested multiple optical audio cords , never was able to get the signal to pass through the device into my receiver . Only worked directly into the receiver . Would have been good if it worked , but sadly it did not . Returned for a refund , looking for another solution .  
1	  its a good idea . however griffin executed iTRIP poorly . The frequency doesn't reach my car stero . not recommended product .  
1	  This is an OK bag , but like many of Lowepro 's bags / packs , the zippers are awkward and stiff to use . Bought it for a new Lumix LX-5 , which fits very well . But the main compartment sits back toward the belt clip ( which is nicely designed ) , so you have to struggle a bit to unzip and extract the camera . I may return it and go with a case logic or some case that 's easier to get in and out of . This has plenty of padding , so much that it adds a lot of bulk . I like protecting my camera , but this is a compact point and shoot , so making it bulky defeats the purpose . Too many of LPs products seem to be better for storage of the camera equipment rather than using it .  
1	  I have a pair of Sennheiser PXC 250 earphone which are far superior . I also have a lower cost Altec Lansing noise cancellation earphones which I would also rate better than these Philips earphones . I may well return them to the them and get my money back .  
2	  I own the Olympus E-20 . The Fujifilm S7000 is half the weight at half the cost and a lot better camera . I 'm very happy with it , though i 've only owned it for 17 days . Very sharp lens . It 's like someone took the time to figure out what was wrong with most top line digitals , and made it right . I own another Fuji ( i wish the 'd drop the " film " part of their name , it confuses people ) and i 've noticed that they are designed very well and are user friendly .  
2	  I have bought 2 of these now at 2 different times and always packaged well and at my home in a couple of days . Great company and great service  
2	  And easily hacked to play DVDs from all regions .  
2	  The sound quality is good but not fabulous . The biggest problem is the hissing sound . But they do reduce noise . It 's not just covering up the noise with the hiss . If you wear them with the power turned on , and no music playing , you can definitely hear outside noises get much quieter . They completely block out sounds of things like cars and buses and air conditioners . And I would estimate that they cancel half of the noise on a jetliner . But for listening to music in a quiet environment they are not so great , because of the hiss . Despite the flaws , they are the lowest priced noise canceling phones I could find , and they do cancel noise very well , so I gave them a 4 .  
2	  My brother was looking for a cheap HDMI cable and I got him this . He uses it on his PS3 and he likes it , then again 1 HDMI cable is basically the same as any other as long as you get a decent build quality and it 's HDMI 1.3 .  
1	  This is the worst piece of equipment I have ever seen . It skipped throughout the DVDs I attempted to play , the remote was virtually useless ( unless you happen to be sitting directly in front of the machine and no more than 2 feet away ) , and it was so light it wouldn't stay where I put it ! Being that there are few controls on the player itself , the remote is a necessity . I ended up returning the thing and getting a better DVD player for only a little more money .  
1	  The problem with this hub is that it has horrible latency . If you 're planning on plugging a thumb drive or external hard drive into this , forget it . If you 're trying to run a keyboard & mouse , it 'll probably work fine . Go from the point of view that anything with an extremely low data rate will work just fine , but anything else is going to have major issues .  
1	  Product is very flimsy and cheaply made . Two fans work and one fan only works for a few seconds every time it 's turned on . I recommend investing in something different .  
2	  The radio works just fine . It is for my kitchen . On some cds it has a high pitch ring squeal .  
2	  While I 'm still in the process of building a new computer and thus may come back and edit this review , but so far I am generally pleased . I bought this because of the HDMI port , as well as all the other video jacks this has . I have a PS3 so I wanted another display to be able to connect it to . I do want to say that my first video card had issues with this monitor . It was an ATI Radeon 850 . If the monitor went into standby , it would not wake up . I remedied this by just turning off the power saving options in Windows . Since then I have built a brand new system which is powered by an Intel 2.66 duo-core CPU , and a HIS Radeon 2900 XT , which is fully HDCP compliant , and possibly why the old ATI card had issues when connected DVI-HDMI . Compared to my old Viewsonic this monitor seems much brighter as well as having better colors . I haven't seen any ghosting yet , but again I 've really only ran Titan Quest & 3DMark . The only CON about this monitor was the price which is due to having the HDMI port .  
1	  I don't know if the unit I got was a lemon , but it had very poor amplification even with the latest firmware on the e260 . Returned it for the Altec Lansing IM4 , which met my expectations for sound but the IM4 doesn't have a cradle that recharges while connected . All of these systems seem over priced for what you get .  
1	  I have to agree with many of the other reviews I have seen . I would give the product ( and company ) zero stars if that was an option . The TV picture is OK , but the DVD player is almost useless . mine will not even identify that a disc is in it now . I did know that my unit was out of warranty when it brokedown . But I had emailed the company for some troubleshooting suggestions on how to overcome the difficulties with the DVD . They would not even reply to the email . So I will quickly be replacing this TV / DVD with a brand that works and will never buy an Apex product again .  
1	  Its a good printer for regular printing , but trying to print a photo is a pain . You have to push and hold the photo paper into the photo tray so that the printer recognizes that the paper is in it . This only works sometimes , you 'll have to fight error after error message to get it to work .  
1	  I returned this item .. write ups were good on it , I tried it over a period of 3 days & it Never copied entire text , left out entire lines & paragraphs . A lot of the words could not be understood by the pen ( some of them easy words ) so it just pops out jumbled letters . You can go back & repair the screwed up text but takes way too much time . It was easy to use as stated in their write ups .  
2	  If you have a laptop with windows NT - this is the way to go . Since NT will not support various external file transfer - this is the easiest way to transfer your file and it is fast . I use it all the time  
1	  When we first installed them , they worked great . Installation was a breeze and everything was wired in throughout the house within an hour . However , after 3-4 months they randomly started cutting in and out on the sound levels . One of the units started making a popping and crackling sound so I had to replace it . I 'm actually looking for a replacement solution now .  
1	  Don't waste your money on it ! I bought this player from * . Loading music to this player is a nightmare , the software with it is a joke , I don't remember when was the last time I successfully loadeda full album to it , most of the time , it hangs in the middle , sometimes when it dies , the file structure is damaged , you haveto format the memory . It is too buggy to be a commercial roduct . It supports SD card , good , but don't expect to load files viaa card reader , the player won't find them ! The only pro is the earbud , I used it with my PDA .  
1	  I bought this armband to use at the gym . Its well designed as far as being able to access the Ipod controls and ports . There are two major flaws however that make this product pretty much useless . 1 ) The armband doesn't stretch . Once you tighten the armband to where it will stay on comfortably there is no way for the band to stretch if your muscles expand during a workout . This might not be an issue for someone jogging but if you are lifting weights it makes things really uncomfortable as it constricts you arm . It also puts a lot of stress on the band causing it to rip . 2 ) The material it is made out of tears easily . I bought this band a month ago or so and it is absolutely shredded . I do work out pretty hard but its ridiculous how ripped up this band has become . I have one or two workouts left until my Ipod flies out of the band .  
2	  What 's to be said ; You 're getting the same original Canon product for 20 % - 30 % less , plus free shipping ( if you don't want it the next day )  
1	  Perhaps I got one of the first ones off the assembly line , because I have encountered nothing but problems over thirty months of use . Using the WPC-11 PCMCIA cards , I have encountered constant connectivity " hangs " over the months , always requiring me to hit the reset switch on the back of the unit to regain a connection to the Internet . Too late to return the unit and 3 wireless cards - stuck with the thing . Downloaded and successfully installed 3 firmware upgrades to no avail , including 1.39.2 , 1.42.7 , and 1.44.2 . Tech support , somewhere in India or Pakistan , told me my chip set is damaged , even though the unit has been plugged into APC UPS with filters , etc . for the last 30 months . When the unit did work , I never got better than 30 foot range . Beyond that the signal would degrade to the point of no connectivity . Company unwilling to offer a coupon or discount on latest and greatest unit , so I 'll move on as you should . A Dissatisfied Customer  
1	  After downloading the driver twice for this wireless card , it just wouldn't work . I called Netgear and when I gave them the serial # they told me that it didn't exist in their files and was probably a fake !  
2	  I bought this item and it just came a couple days ago and accidentally I ran over it with my car it cracked a little bit but it was still working good after it happened so it is very durable even after it was crushed . I just bought another because its the best I ever owned .  
2	  Ok .. when i opened my computer to install the card , i had a few problems getting the card to fit in the slot right . After getting past that problem , i had no other problems after downloading the patches from pinnacle like the other reviewers said to do . This product is awesome ! Im glad i stuck with it after the inital problem because it really is a good product for the price . I would give it five stars , but i had the inital problem , and i did have to download a patch . Otherwise , it is a great product for editing dv tapes .  
2	  The Pac Swix interfaced with my JVC head unit brilliantly . It was a little tedious to program , but I got it the second time around . As far as a delay goes , it 's not really a constant delay . Sometimes you press the button and get an immediate response and sometimes you need to press the button once more because of a non responsive press . The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because there is a difference between the stock headunit 's response and the aftermarket 's . It really does give you flexibility as far as programming goes since you can assign a button a function of your choice . Simple three wire hookup to my Mercury was nice too . I say if you like your steering wheel controls and you have a JVC , Alpine , or other compatible unit , then you need this little box for your install .  
1	  The earphones were too big for my ear . I used them to work out and they kept falling out of my ear because they were too big . I ended up having to purchase Jbuds and they had several different sized covers and they fit in my ear much better .  
2	  I used one of these for a year or so , before giving it to my mother when I upgraded to the wireless version ; it 's worked fine the whole time , and now my very non-technical parents have a home network . To respond specifically to the comment titled " Works great - as long as you dont host anything " from May 9 , 2002 : this router does indeed support multiple computers while enabling you to host a web site ; mine 's been doing exactly that for a year or so . The documentation states that you have to disable DHCP to enable port forwarding , but I 've found this to be incorrect : you can still forward to a specific local IP address , if you 've given that particular machine a static IP . I just picked a particular address for my Linux server ( e.g. 192.168.0.100 ) , and forward port 80 to it ; the other machines can still get their addresses via DHCP . Even if it were true that you had to disable DHCP to do port forwarding , this doesn't mean you can't support multiple machines - you can always assign static IP addresses to your machines . This is easy : just make them up , as long as they 're in the local subnet range ( by default , 192.168.0 . xx , where xx is from 1 to 255 - I suggest starting at 100 to avoid conflict with DHCP ) , and set that address in your computer 's network settings . Pick different ones for each computer , of course . I suspect that the " you must disable DHCP " business has more to do with keeping people from getting themselves in trouble by setting up port forwarding to dynamically assigned addresses .  
1	  I love the design and feel of the keyboard , but after about less than 6 months of use , it developed a mind of it 's own and works when it wants to .. dropping letters or not picking up anything when I type . I 've tried new batteries , a different port on the desktop for the usb attachment , even relocating the machine so it 's in a more direct line with the signal . I even tried using the keyboard in a room with no other wireless equipment . Bottom line is the thing is hopeless . I 've resorted to an older less ergonomically correct keyboard I have .. very disappointing and an expensive mistake .  
2	  The Sto-fen Omni-Bounce OM-600 Flash Diffuser fits snugly on my Nikon SB-600 speedlight . It softens the light so I can use the SB-600 more for people shots , fill lighting , and more natural colors overall . It 's a simple durable material and will allow you to get the tones you desire in all your shots .  
2	  I bought PDR-M25 and have been using it for the last 4 months . I am very happy that I made this purchase and it 's really proved it 's worth . It 's got no fancy features and so very decently priced . I wouldn't be using most of the features that are provided with the higher priced cameras anyways . A truly worthy deal ..  
1	  I bought this when I lost the cable that came with my YP-z5 . The cable lets me charge the player 's battery , but not sync with my computer to change the music . The player reports that it 's connected in USB , followed by MTP mode , but my computer is unable to see the player properly . It 's not a computer issue , nothing changed on my computer , and I tried with 2 different computers that both worked with the factory cable . Sometimes when I disconnect the player now , it thinks it 's still connected and won't do anything until I hit the reset button . Every once in a while , if I keep unplugging / replugging it in , I can sometimes get a proper sync ( assuming it doesn't freeze up first ) . Considering everything worked fine the week before , when I used the factory cable , I 'm gonna blame it on the new cable . I 'm a tech expert and know what I 'm doing , the only conclusion I can come to is that the source of my new found troubles is this new cable . Save yourself the trouble and go find the factory cable . I 'm buying one off of e-bay as I write this because I am fed up with the inability to sync . I give 2 stars because at least I can still charge my battery .  
1	  The GPS couldn't pick up the sattelites while I was in downtown Ottawa , Canada . Afterward , it couldn't pck up any signals even we are in suburd of Ottawa with no high rise building . In the states , the GPA works fine .  
2	  I got the Pyramid 446 Gold series .. not sure if i was supposed to or not but they appear to be made pretty well and they do actually sound better than my 2 year old 60 $ Sony 4x6 's .. anyone with a good amount of audio experience will tell you to always buy round speakers because they sound much better !  
2	  I find these headphones very comfortable , crystal clear sound in the same room and have a decent range - I washed my car out back while listening to the TV through 4 cement walls , pretty good , with some static . I use them to watch TV in the same room while the fiance reads a book , or to play video game without annoying others . Great for my purposes and good price .  
2	  I bought this system recently and think this is a great system to have for the price range . I did extensive research and found that through all of the reviews here and elsewhere and the amount of extras you get , I made a great choice . The system looks good , in my opinion , has all of the bells and whistles of more expensive systems ( HDMI , FM tuner , wireless capability , etc ) and sounds great . Connecting this system couldn't have been easier . I connected the HDMI cable from the system to my Samsung LCD TV , a Toslink cable from my HD cable modem to the system and the rest is history . There were two draw backs ( and the reasons I didn't give it 5 stars ) . One is the instructions and its short explanations for all of its options . I 'm a novice when it comes to audio systems and the instructions can be confusing in identifying which function is relevant to whatever listening situation . I have to do research to get the full benefit of some of the features . For a system in this price range , I would think it would be more " user friendly " in the instructions department . The other is the delays related to loading the CD / DVD 's and its start up . But that 's okay as all of the other features far outweigh this one drawback .  
2	  I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH MY SAMSUNG CAMERA PURCHASE . ALSO , THE SERVICE FROM AMAZON WAS GREAT . I JUST HAD MY FIRST SET OF PICTURES DEVELOPED AND THEY CAME OUT EXCELLENT . I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CAMERA TO EVERYONE . JOAN  
2	  Love it ! Very simple and very sturdy . Even has an extra spot for a flash mount accessory ( no power to the extra spot ) . Great for if you 're using a DSLR that records video . You can mount the flash on one and a microphone on the other ( in case you 're switching back and forth from video to photo .  
1	  If you need to add a phone extension without cables or need to hook up a fax machine this product is ok , but for modems and internet connections , your speed will go doown to 9600 or even less .  
1	  frequent troubles after anti-virus software download ( trend Micro ) . removednorten before downlad . I bought sr5010nx 2 months ago ( amazon ) it worksgood . At that time also , I have troubles to remove the norten . It has taken many hours . I will never purchase compaq presario in future and not recommend it . I will try with norten anti-virus protection , but result is open . Troubles in details : Error message : A problem has been detected & windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer etc . - PS : I have contacted many factory-technicians , but troubleshooting different and in vain until now . Please , take my concern into consideration and replace it , if possble . because amazon has a reputation ? Name . customer NC .  
1	  As of December 13 , 2004 , the Netgear MP101 is NOT for the serious music fan for the simple reason that the software is not able to handle a large volume of CDs - say , more than 90 discs worth of music . When you get to upwards of 1,400 song it justs shuts down and deletes any playlists you 've created without any sort of warning ala " sorry , but you can't add any more songs . " With over 1,200 CDs in my collection , I had hoped to save them to the CPU - which has had no trouble storing that quantity , listen to them through the MP101 , and then create a whole lot of shelf space by selling those CDs that I don't listen to all the much . The tech support , in India , is 24/7 , free for the first 90 days and is actually pretty good , even though I wish those jobs were here in the US instead . They said that future versions ( mine is the 3.3.36 one ) will hopefully be able to handle greater quantities , and that I could download them for free from the Netgear homepage , but they were not ableto give me a real idea if later versions would ever be able to handle the volume I 'm talking about . Otherwise , if you don't have that many CD 's it 's actually a pretty cool little toy as the display shows the song title , artist and CD title and will even " crawl " any lengthy info across the screen . The wireless connection with the server worked immediately about 50 % of the time , but was able to detect the server pretty quickly ( 1-2 mins ) the rest of the time . I had a firewall problem when I first set it up that was blocking transmission , but the tech guys walked me through the patch , no probs . Like I said , this is a cute toy , but not a real tool for those who hope that technology can help them create any significan shelf space .  
2	  The bulb on our tv burnt out on Father 's Day morning ! Bad timing .. but we ordered on a sunday and received it on Wednedsay ! Very happy with the FAST shipping and excellent product we recieved .. good service with great instructions . Very happy with this purchace and seller and will definitely use them again !  
2	  Great TV . I received this TV back in 2004 , and have been pleased with it ever since . The picture is great and the connectivity is pretty good too . The only complaint I have is the weight . 130lbs is pretty heavy , but to be expected with a CRT tv this size . Amazon 's shipping company put a small crack in the side of the casing ( cosmetic only ) , which was disappointing , but Amazon said they would RMA it with no problem , but I didn't want to send it back . Otherwise , Great product .  
1	  WE BOUGHT THIS ALONG TIME AGO DOESN'T DO JACK , YOU LOAD IT UP IT FREEZES , IT 'S LINE OF SITE .. THIS THING BLOWS .. I HEARD THERES A RECALL / LAWSUIT PLEASE HELP SOMEONE STEER US IN RIGHT DIRECTION .. IM A DISABLED MARINE MY GIRLFRIEND BOUGHT SO I COULD USE TV .. NOT HAPPENING .

1	  My 97 year old grandmother lives in a nursing home so I bought this tape to label the new clothes I bought for her . The other tags that were available online looked like it would take a really long time to get so I opted for this option since I already owned a Brother label maker . The reviews here also looked very promising . A few days ago , I created five labels and followed the directions ( e.g. , made sure I pressed very firmly over a thin cloth on top of the label with the iron for 30 seconds ) . I washed the clothes to test how well the labels stayed on and after the first wash , the labels are already peeling off on the sides . I don't have time to test the other labels that are available on the market so I am going to try to sew the corners of the label down for now . Since I haven't tried the other tags / labels available on the market , I can't say that this is worse or better . I 'm disappointed , however , with this product and will not recommend this to anyone who wants to label clothes for someone in the nursing home or " sleep away " camp . It might work for someone if he / she will be doing the laundry and can monitor the tags after each wash .  
2	  I 've had this receiver for a few months and enjoy listening to it . I 'm a conservatory-trained musician , and listen to mostly classical , some folk . My previous amp was an old NAD which I 'd found on eBay - wonderful sound , but it had become unusable . When I first tried the Onkyo I wasn't convinced , however after setting it to direct audio mode the sound was much better , and that 's where I keep it . I have Bowers & Wilkens bookshelf speakers and a Yamaha subwoofer . The only thing the NAD had over this is that it was probably a little warmer sounding , but the Onkyo is very clean and full and the sound has a lot of quality to it .  
2	  Just received this pair or wireless speakers today and I 'm very impressed ! They are very easy to set up , the sound is excellent and they are nice and compact . I initially tried these speakers with my MP3 player and they sounded good . Then I hooked them up using the headphone jack on my receiver and they kicked it up a notch ! Really , with the stronger signal they are much fuller and fit the bill perfectly . I would definately buy these again !  
2	  The Toner Buzz People have very fast service and ship Genuine HP Toner cartridge in double seal box . they have Excellent service . i give them Five stars . Floyd K.  
1	  If you try to use a Microsoft Force Feedback joystick then forget about this simple cable with 2 connectors . I called Belkin and they assured me I will not have problem with my Microsoft Force Feedback . As usual today , they lied . I ordered from XP PASSPORT for about 3 dollars plus more than 8 dollars shipping and handling ( one man or woman handling from the shelf to the envelope ) . Now checking their return policy they refund the merchandise but not the shipping costs . As you reckon I am not going to pay a shipping to get 3 dollars back , even I doubt they give the money back . XP PASSPORT took a super long time to ship . So Belkin and XP PASSPORT belong to the same society . Shame on Belkin and shame on XP PASSPORT.I think Amazon should check close this guys .  
1	  I don't get MIcrosoft they think this Zune can take over the Ipod . Who would wan't to buy a bulky player that looks like that old classic football game from the 80s or like something they gave away on Let 's Make a Deal . Why did they pick the color of dookie as a color option . Another stupid thing about this is that you can't use Microsoft 's own Media Player or music from other places like itunes and such , you have to download Zune 's music and player . Also why is it that you can't use this on a Mac . But if you own a Mac you would wan't to buy a Ipod which comes in different sizes , colors and GB storage . It takes such a long time for the Zune to transfer you music files from your media player to Zune 's one . That sharing music between other Zune 's is lame as well becasue how many people do you know that even own a Zune . So what if this has a radio there is nothing great on the radio anyways . If you wan't to buy a mp3 player get a ipod there is a reason there the top selling one and no i am not a Mac / Ipod fanboy or a employee of Apple .  
1	  I frankly hear very little improvement over the run of the mill earbuds . At 76 bucks or so I expected a significant difference . Probably my hearing isn't good enuf to appreciate the quality these buds are supposed to represent . I still prefer my ancient over-the-head tiny-bud set i got with my 1980 's sony tape walkman . They stay on while I walk and the sound is acceptable . gm  
1	  I got these after breaking a pair of Sharper Image noise-cancelling headphones , thinking that Sennheiser would be a good replacement , noise-cancelling or not . Not really . I used them just one day , trying them with digitally remastered music , even music mixed in * 5.1 Surround Sound * , and there was just no boom from the bass , like was promised on the packaging . At a higher volume , the music is slightly more quality , but the music still lacked substance to me . There was this , and there was the fact that the leatherette around the edge of each of the earpieces gave me discomfort because the phones concealed my ears completely but not my lobes , and it felt almost like blood got cut off at that part . For this and the above reason I am sending these things back . In all , don't get these if you want wraparound headphones and you think " Sennheiser = Class . " I suppose these would be more suitable as DJ headphones , but I do not know .  
2	  Don't waste your time buying anything else but the Monster Cable iCarPlay Transmitter . It is worth every penny . My husband and I purchased two other transmitters and returned both due to static and songs cutting in and out . Once we purchased the iCarPlay we have not had any static problems . The music is so clear that you would think it was playing directly from your car radio . I highly recommend this product !  
1	  This product could put user / customer 's life at risk . The mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road . This is the worst product that I have used in my life .  
2	  Excellent headphones . This is the 5th set of headphones I 've gone through and I 'll be sticking with these for awhile for a few reasons . First , they 're durable and made to last . The headband is padded and strong and won't snap , warp , or bend . The cups are very secure . And , most importantly , the single wire config is well protected , especially at the point of connection on the cup . Second , the sound is excellent . Very clear and crisp . I mean VERY CLEAR and CRISP . The sound really surrounds the ear because of the 50mm cups which really adds to encompassing you in the music . I used to have a problem with the bass , but then I found out that it was the source of the music that made the bass shallow ( my laptop ) . When I went to a different source ( my walkman ) I really knew what they meant by the Brainshaker Technology . These headphones are not very good at filtering out external noises , but I don't mind , in fact I prefer it that way . I like to know what 's going on around me .  
2	  I had ear buds before this so there really isn't much comparison . The sound is good with decent base , the fit is good . After about 2 days of 8 hour listening my ears began to hurt from being squeezed . They appear to be build rather strong , large wide adjustable headband . The long cord is a bonus . For the price you can't beat it .  
2	  there is no better way to copy slides in an affordable way but making sure that you maintain quality and usability . You are copying ur slides at the full resolution potential of your dslr . I recommend this to anyone , just do some research to make sure the focal length will work with your lens . It takes a lot of extensions .. iv got loads of up and down c rings that i put together to make sure it focused accurately .. if you can work round those problems , u will be blown away !  
1	  Horrible battery . I was hoping the battery would last a good hour or so with a good charge . Battery does not hold at least a 1 % charge while charging . Disappointed .  
1	  After two months it just keeps overheating ! Filter is clean but constantly shuts off . I have very short thin hair and this hair dryer has to cool down at a minimum of three times before I can dry my hair . Not very powerful , a waist of money and another item sent to the land fill .  
2	  This is just an MP3 card reader , with nothing else . If you are getting an SD card then it is great , but don't think your kid is going to change his Ipod ! I paid around $ 30 so it was great . Sound is also good .  
1	  I bought one of these at a local retail store . The keys scrape against the casing as you press them , so you have to press harder which strains the fingers and wrists . The enter key is especially difficult , as I have to jam my pinky finger down real hard in the center of the key . A lot of keyboards have issues with detecting multiple keys being held at the same time . But this is the only keyboard I 've ever seen that can't detect more than one arrow key being held at the same time , making some games unplayable . No diagonal scrolling in Starcraft , for example . I found a workaround , though : turn off numlock and diagonals will work . Better yet , just throw away this garbage . Quite possibly the worst Belkin product , and that 's saying something !  
2	  I was looking for an affordable lens to take on vacation with me and this one performed great . The large aperture is great for shooting in low light at all focal lengths ( not quite like my 50mm / 1.8 , but I enjoy being able to zoom ) . Part of me wishes I had bit the bullet and gotten the new one with IS , but I got some really nice shots with this lens . I 'm going to get rid of my kit lens because this one is SO much better . Totally worthwhile purchase !  
1	  I bought 2 while I was in the US and unfortunately the do not fit in the in Germany and after I bought an adapter they did not work . Both did not deliver the correct voltage .  
2	  It 's a little embarassing to admit given that I am a 1 ) guitar player 2 ) an Apple computer devotee for over 20 years 3 ) a programmer 4 ) have over 500 CDs and 5 ) am generally a technogeek who spends on average 6 hours a day in front of a computer - but I had completely ignored iTunes and iPod and all that stuff . My car has a CD player and I had always listened to CDs that I wanted on the way to and from work . And I have a pretty decent 6.1 surround system at home for watching my rock and roll DVDs et al. So when my wife gave me a sliver mini-iPod for my birthday , along with an FM transmitter so that I could charge it and play it in the car , I smiled and said thank you and was less than thrilled . But then I looked at iTunes and thought , " Wow , this is a pretty cool program . " I liked the playlist idea and started encoding my CDs and making playlists . 7.8 Gigs later ( only about 1/4 of my CD collection ) I am ecstatic . I like Rock and Roll . I hate the radio . I remember when DJs played what they wanted , and made segues and miniconcerts and albums that sounded great . Nowadays , it seems like there are on the order of 3 or 4 " approved " songs for each artist . Like the Rolling Stones ? Well , you can hear " Can't always get what you want " , or " Satisfaction " or " Miss You " , but you 'll never hear " Sweet Virginia " or " Fingerprint Files " . Themes ? Forget about it . Like live music ? Forget about it . Radio is dead . Then came iPod . Oh Joy . I make playlists of genres and moods , or artists or , hell , anything I want . Copying these ( and the associated songs ) to the 3.7 GB iPod hard disk is quick and easy , and automatic . Want to use your iPod to transfer huge libraries from computer to computer ? No problem . Apple 's software won't let you because of possible copyright infringement issues , but plenty of third party software lets you do it quickly and easily . I can also keep my calendar on the iPod and download MapQuest directions and Swedish cookie recipes . Yes , you can use the iPod alone . The earplugs that come with it are OK , but I don't use them . I had a set of Sennenheiser noise cancelling headphones and the iPod drives them just fine and the sound is outstanding . I also hook the iPod up to my home sound system for parties . Totally outstanding . I have been using the high level headphone out ( got to keep the iPod volume at about half or so for best results ) but things are fine . I have a minidock upstairs that would probably be better ( it has a low level line out ) but I don't want to buy another and it needs a computer . I never have any problem with power . Between my Monster FM car adapter ( which charges ) and my minidock , the thing never runs out . I estimate that I would get at least 6 hours between recharges using my Sennenheisers and that 's fine with me . I 've used it at home and in the car and at work for over a month and never had a single glitch . I started encoding with Apple 's AAC at the default 128 kpbs and although I could not hear the difference with any headphones , I could when I connected it to my home system . So I upped it to 192 kbps and now cannot hear the difference ( at least with rock and roll and my old , guitar-damaged ears ) . So , yahoo . What a totally cool thing . It 's a hobby in and of itself . Great software , great hardware and tons of fun . Highly recommended . Addendum February 4 , 2005I have been reading about a minority of folks who have had trouble , usually repeatedly , with various iPods . The repeated trouble is a clue that points towards user error . The iPod is a hard disk drive - relative to other hard disks it is very hardy and durable but if you throw it around , bang it against hard objects while running , let it freeze outside in your car etc . , I am pretty sure that it will malfunction . Think about hitting your desktop with a hammer . Meanwhile , with a bit of common sense care , I expect mine to last for quite a while . Also , the battery complaint is a strange piece of fiction . If you look on the internet , you will readily find a number of replacement batteries ( should the need arise ) at less than $ 40 .  
2	  It has an adustable strap and the case keeps the camera nice , snug and protected  
2	  I 've had this product for about a month and overall , I find it very good . I use it to connect to my D-Link wireless router that is 2 floors above my computer in my split-level home . The signal fluctuates between low and very good but is always more than enough for internet connections . Even on a " fair " connection , I still was getting 600K download speed from Microsoft 's website . Bottom line , if you 're using it for large file transfers at a long distance or though a few walls , it 's not going to be that great . However , if you just want it to share an internet connection , it 's great .  
1	  Does not compare to Toshiba HD-XA2 for Upconversion . Blu-Ray may be fine but nothing compares to the Toshiba HD-XA2 for Upconversion that is out there on the market .  
1	  a similar cable like 50 cents hdmi doing the same only if you see a monster cable in the store do you buy a electronic the specialist who selling asking you , you supoust to buy because you cant receive a good reception that fair if it not trufh .. dot spend money look in amazon . com you buing for 10 dollars maybe the same monster cable  
1	  My husband and I purchased this printer last March , after years of owning ink jet printers . There are several advantages to a laser over the ink jet , namely the speed of printing , as well as the vastly reduced overall cost of printing . Yes , toner is more expensive , but it lasts significantly longer than a cartridge of ink . We will definitely stick with laser printers in the future . But pertaining to this particular printer , we are not impressed . Twice in the one year we have owned this Canon , the printer roller has broken . The first time , it was still under warranty and I will say we got excellent customer service from Canon . We took it to a local authorized repair shop , and the service plus parts were free . However , less than 3 months later , we have the same problem . At this point , I don't know if we will fix it ( for a minimum of $ 60 ) or just purchase a new one-different brand ! We don't do an excessive amount of printing ; I 'd call it moderate . Yet the paper jams frequently and the cheap plastic parts associated with the roller bar , as well as the incredibly tiny opening the manual suggests we use for proper paper removal make it a nightmare ! Bottom line is if you have not experienced the joy of owning a laser printer , let me allay your fears and encourage you to purchase one . But after a full year of owning the Canon Imageclass MF3240 , I 'd say avoid this one .  
2	  Pair this up with some door actuators for my 1999 Civic . Was extremely easy to add onto my Viper alarm and would do it again if I needed to install an alarm in another vehicle .  
1	  Well it 's cheap , it has a high cut-off , and I cant say I am all that impressed with it at all . This is not a coated filter , instead it is just colored glass . While it does filter to the IR range , I would recommend essentially any other brand . It even came with marks on the glass , presumably from uneven dying .  
2	  DVI male to male . Best price for a reliable almost 10ft cable . You cannot go wrong with these . They arrived with the quickness . Great product !  
2	  I own a dj 15gb which I had now for approximately three years . I love it . I read the reviews that the player will not support playforsure audio . This is totally incorrect . I download music from Walmart and all their music is in the playforsure format . I never had a problem using MusicMatch to download audio onto my dj . The dj controls are easy to navigate . My only compliant is that there is no review button . The sound is superb , I suggest you purchase KOSS Stereo In Ear Ear Plugs . I previously owned a RCA Lyra which had a FM transmitter . It was a waste of money , because I never listened to FM . What is the purpose of a FM transmitter when you have your own music to listen to ? I would never consider owning an ipod , for all my downloaded music is in the playforsure format , which ipod definitely does not support . Sony ipod is a rip off , because it does not allow you to use any other format , except itunes . An ipod is NOT the best or economically audio player . It is only a popular audio player .  
1	  May 2011 reivew : Purchased in April 2011 . Worked Ok for one month . On the 37th day , paper quit feeding properly . " PAPER JAM " only fixable when the paper is still trying to feed through . Once the machine makes a page disappear while printing , there is no fix . Print paper literally goes to the bottom of the printer , gets trapped , the printer does not open for maintenance , and the printer is forever broken . A Google search for " Lexmark X4530 paper jam " today , indicates PAPER JAM is a very well known , unsolvable problem .  
1	  I bought mine in February of 2009 , it is now June 2009 and it is dead . Won't hold charge . Avoid this cheap imitation at all costs !  
1	  I compared these against a pair of Shure SE110 earphones ( $ 60 cheaper ) , and I can say without a doubt that the Shures blow these " monsters " out of the water . They were superior in every way - general build quality , frequency range , clarity , and bass response . The monster earphones also distort at much lower volumes than the Shures . Don't be fooled by the Monster brand marketing or fancy packaging . Monster spends there time and money on marketing and suing small companies that want to use the word " Monster " in their name , and obviously much less time and money on product research and development . These earphones are lower quality than even some of the cheap Sony earphones and should be avoided at all costs .  
2	  I have had my sony vgn c140g for almost 5 years now . I have taken decent care of it , reformatted its drive and it has never crashed on me . I have dropped it , jostled it , carried it everywhere and it has never let me down . Only now is it starting to show its age . I don't have enough good things to say about the sony vaio computers because of this little beauty .  
2	  I am very pleased with the Samsung 56 " 1080p DLP HDTV . The picture is very sharp and the colors look so vivid . I 've had the t . v . a little over a month and recently upgraded to HD satellite . I also own a Xbox360 and absolutely love how much clearer it looks over my 32 " LCDTV . I would definitely recommend this t . v . to any one looking for a great picture at a decent price .  
2	  I purchased this cam for my wife in 2007 , I wanted something inexpensive but gets the job done . I 've been buying cannon cameras for years now and this one does not disappoint , picture quality , battery life , size all top notch . I read a lot about lens jamming and expensive repairs , I suggest you get a warranty for it , I guess a few out there are lemons . Oh , I would like to also add , I purchased this camera new for $ 213.51 on 2/5/2007 , the price tag on it now is steep , more then double , no longer and inexpensive camera . At this price I won't buy it again , five stars then , four stars now .  
2	  Shipping policies , which weren't a problem have changed since I bought my pinnacle pctv deluxe usb with remote . But as far as the product goes , I couldn't be happier . It does exactly what it says , and doesn't crash . It records cable tv , nad has RCA & S-Video ( inputs ) , which can be recorded from . The remote does work , which I have read posting else where saying it doesn't . The slight draw back is that the tv application has to be selected ( highlighted ) on your task bar for the remote to work . As far as the remote , it 's cool looking , has many options , and allows you to control the station menu on the monitor . The unit itself is compact , and very handy b / c it 's external ( usb ) . The software is decent ; for real time tv viewing , great . The timelapse ( like TiVo ) , works great too , and a conversion program ( included ) converts them into vcd , svcd , mpegll ps ( DVD ) . The program also can burn them straight to cd / dvd ( haven't tried yet ) if u have dvd writer . The recorder scheduler is ok , messes up occasionally , but works . Overall , a great product , but like I said : SYSTEM WILLINGI have a dell dim 8100 Pentium 4 1.7ghz w / 256mb ram , and 45GB storage . It runs good on it , but I probably wouldn't want to have any less .. newer computers would prolly run awesome with it . I think one big factor is having usb 2.0 . I have 1.1 and it runs good , but maybe with usb 2.0 a slower system could run well with it . I 'm planning on buying a usb2.0 card soon , but haven't so I don't know . You definately need a good amount of storage . I 'd say a good 20Gb .. more or less depending on how much you record , and how often you delete old pctv video files ( easy to do , use gallery ) . The video files can get pretty large , especially if you are recording in hi qual .  
2	  I got a set of these for a friend and had to get one for me .  
1	  I returned it . The plain rabbit ears from Sears work better . Very disappointing .  
2	  I picked up a pair of these three or four years ago from Wal-Mart for around $ 8.00 and I 've never worn a pair that was any more comfortable . The sound quality of the HS43 is excellent for their size and they are light as a feather . They 're a little more cumbersome to put on than regular over-the-head type headphones but they stay in place well . I can easily wear them for extended periods , unlike ear buds , which I detest wearing because I find them uncomfortable and they don't stay in my ear canal . For comfort , value and performance , these headphones are pretty much unbeatable .  
2	  Nice all in one for the home or small office . Total setup time from the box was about a half hour . No problems with software setup . Great photo printing . Great text printing , scans and copies . At this time I can't say how fast I 'll be going through ink cartridges , but like the fact the three colors have their own separate tanks .  
2	  I am not a computer " techie " and the thought of opening my computer to install anything makes me nervous . But the directions were very easy to follow and when it was all over and done , I felt as though I had accomplished something ! .. I have had no problems with it and am very happy with the purchase .  
1	  I do not understand how someone has not taken action against Sony for this product . If there 's a laywer out there in search for a class action , they should look into this . I am using a GRV550 right now and this is the third time I start writing a review .. it shut down twice in less than an hour ! Besides that major flaw , this machine is extremely noisy and it gets extremely hot . If you take those three into account , you rule out 99 % of the settings where a laptop would be of any use . I contacted their customer support a couple of times and they were helplessly hopeless - or hopelessly helpless .. They basically ask you to reset the bios . They obviously already know this thing is a lemon so they will just make you waste some time . I would gladly return this piece of plastic if I could . Won't be getting any more Sony during this lifetime for sure !  
2	  Great product . I have no fear of my iPod falling out yet it 's easily removed when I need to . The lanyard works , the belt clip works fine . You can't beat the price and the front is unique which is fun . They also include a sceen protector . Mygift was fine , arrived on time .  
1	  i got this expctng a 2 way splitter but only one slot worked on it , any other cable splitter would work but this cheap piece of crap !  
2	  this is the first wireless n product I 've owned , so I really have no basis to compare against except my older linksys 10/100 router with a linksys wireless G access point . One big noticeable difference is the wifi speed of the wireless n to my television which has a wifi n adapter , it is fast enough to view HD streaming easily . However , with this particular product , the wifi tends to drop probably 2-3 times a week , which means I must log and reboot the device or manually unplug the power to restart it . One feature I liked on the linksys access point was that wifi devices could be placed on a MAC access list while those on the LAN could be connected freely , the D-Link doesn't seem to segregate the LAN and wifi devices , if you want a MAC access control feature enabled , you must list all wifi devices as well as your regular LAN devices .  
1	  Bought this from Office Max a year and a half ago . After my Windows ME crashed , I re-installed the softwarefor the printer . Now it is not recognized by my PC anymore . So , currently I have a glorified copier on my desk . I called the tech support several times , but since ayear has passed since I purchased this , they are not verysympathetic . I understand . I should have been suspiciouswhen Office Max had put this on sale .  
2	  Purchased this product in August and three days later got on a plane for a family vacation in Mexico . The thing that became apparent straight out the box is the ease of use of this camera .. despite the rather daunting manual that comes with the machine . We wanted a DVD based machine for the ease of shooting and straight into the PC without the use of cables and this machine couldn't be easier to use . The menus are intuitive and rational making first movies very simple . Formatting the disc is a simple and pain free operation as is finalizing prior to viewing on a PC then it 's straight into the computer for any editing or simple viewing pleasure . Colors are great as is the detail at least in daytime , beach and sunny locations as we haven't had the desire to take night video . The camera also does still shots but since this isn't why I bought it I won't critique their quality which is obviously not as good as the 7MP pocket still camera we throw in our bag . All in all very happy with the purchase and at a great price !  
2	  Bought this item used , but works like it is new . Love the features , can be managed from any pc in the network , and allows great multi tasking .  
1	  In theory , this gizmo sounds pretty awesome and great , right ? Wrong ! Granted , it does what it says it does , and is pretty user-friendly , but that 's where the bargain ends . The sound is very tinny and ' Mickey-Mouse ' and , on the one we ordered , one of the CD channels didn't play at all . When we tried to patch this thing into our higher quality stereo system , we still got an awful sound quality because it records based on the sound quality the component itself produces . I guess there are no quick fixes where this is concerned ; if you want to make quality CD 's from your old tapes and albums , go to an electronics store and get the components the store recommends . It may be considerably more complicated , but the quality will be well worth it . The Crosley CD Songwriter is nothing more than an expensive piece of garbage in an attractive cabinet .  
1	  this wire is not true 4 gauge . i would not recomend this for anything other than speaker wire  
1	  This sheets couldn't be any dryer , ergo useless . Guess I 'm going back to the liquid .. BAD BAD BAD . Apparently they do expire , and they are sending old sheets .  
2	  I lost my Olympus Stylus 500 camera that I had bought 2 years ago , and got this one to replace it . It ( 1 ) is lighter , ( 2 ) , cheaper , and ( 3 ) has enhanced additional features like image stabilization and a better optical zoom . I LOVE this camera , and I was pretty fond of the 500 . It has all the features I loved about the 500 ( large digital viewfinder / viewing screen , weatherproof gaskets ) , plus more . The photos are terrific . I originally bought the 500 because it was more than a " point and shoot " ( i.e. you could take it off of " automatic " and play with the ISO , etc . if you wanted to ) , but I have to admit I have NEVER done that because the photos on the auto setting are so good . If you are looking for an excellent , light , durable all-round use camera of the ( mostly ) point-and-shoot variety , this one is for you .  
2	  I got one of these cards so I can game at gigabit LAN parties and I 've started upgrading my home network to gigabit . All three of my PCs at home have one of these cards in them and I found the install to be so much easier than I thought . Windows basically installed this automatically for me . Just shut down , power off , physically install card into PCI slot , boot PC back up and let windows search for driver and you point to the CD that came with the adapter and BAM ! you are up and running with gigabit aon the next reboot . I can now transfer files soo much faster between my PCs . I share and save video files , games , CDs , MP3s , etc between all my PCs and this card and gigabit switch have greatly decreased the time it takes to transfer large files from one PC to the next . This is vital at a LAN party when everyone is trading files . The faster I can go the better . Thanks D-Link !  
2	  No complaints ! Large viewing area , uses & supports most SD cards . Battery life isn't bad either . The only " con " would be that tight / close shots are almost impossible ( like 8-12 " ) very blurry . But besides that it 'll make ya smile without saying " cheese " !  
1	  I received the cable but it did not fit my Kindle . I returned it to the address and it was returned to me by the post office saying that this was an old address . I contacted the company and was asked to mail my cable on to another customer who ordered the same cable . I did this the same day . I have yet to receive my refund .  
2	  I purchased this specific unit because the TiVo forums recommended this unit as one that works well in helping to wirelessly connect the TiVo S3 to my home network . It was easy to install ( plug and play ) . Shortly after attaching this unit to the TiVo and going through the setup on the GUI , my TiVo was connected to my network . Overall setup time was less than 20 minutes . Since then I 've been enjoying the network functionality of my TiVo ( viewing my digicam pics on my TV , using the MP3 jukebox , and downloading program guides via the internet , etc . ) In the 3.5 months since I implemented , I have not had to reset the unit once . For my application , this unit works really well , although it may not be a great fit for others with different applications . In my opinion , this would a bulky unit to attach to a laptop for mobile computing , but could be a cost effective solution if you were to attach it to desktop .  
2	  The only problem is the viewfinder in hot sunlight , being an elderly it 's hard to see when you try to take a picture in bright sunlight on the outside , living in Florida . An additional Optic View finder would very much appreciated .  
1	  Ordered this product in November and still have not received it yet ! I will never use amazon . com again !  
2	  Compared to current surround stereo speakers like the Altec Lansing brands , the quality is quite good . I experimented by playing Half-Life ( which has excellent 3D surround sound ) , and Planetscape Torment . The sound quality for both was excellent . However , the surround sound quality for Half-Life was patchy . This might 've been more to do with my room than the speakers . The speakers are marginally less useful for playing CDs on . For some reason , the volume for CD playback is slightly lower than for game sound effects . In summary , if you 're looking for surround stereo speakers and can't afford the more expensive Altec Lansing brands , then I definitely reccommend this one . Just remember that surround stereo sounds better in an enclosed room .  
1	  My first GPS . It was pretty expensive and had lots of nice features ( ability to save many tracks ) . The software is very US-centric . It worked very well on the flat and in unwooded conditions . However don't use one of these things to navigate in the bush ( use a compass ) . The technology is just not there to cope with either valleys or an overhead canopy . It was handy to confrm where I was when I found a clearing on top of a hill . Finally although the battery life is better than most it is still abysmal . In summary these things are still a toy for a tramper rather than an essential tool .  
2	  Nothing to complain about . They function exactly how most of the reviews say they will . I use them while mowing lawn and they make the time much more enjoyable than without them or using traditional headphones . Great product .  
1	  For the people saying that this is a good modem , must not be using the internet at a constant rate . If you are a hardcore internet user like me , where you are constantly downloading , gaming , or web-browsing , then do not rent / buy this modem . You WILL have your internet connection dropped constantly . I have to unplug the cable modem about once every 30 minutes then replug it back in to get my internet to working status . I 've called Comcast to make sure it 's not something on their side and it 's not . It 's not my computer either because I used to get download rates tremendously high and no dropped connection before I moved about 2 months ago . After purchasing a my own cable modem instead of renting this one , I have had a large increase in my speed and have had no dropped connections .  
1	  It simply does not work . I tried everything . Thought it was formatting or something else . Made sure the lock was off . But it still did not work . Seeing how many others had the same experience I 'm sending it back . You would think Amazon would get the message .  
1	  These headphones don't stay in your ears . Despite what others have said about warming them up and they 'll fit .. well that 's a load of U-know-what . I shouldn't have to run a couple miles before I can listen to my favorite music because the darn headphones won't stay in my ears . The only way I have gotten these to stay put is to lift , drop and twist them down into my ear . This works pretty good but hurts after a while . plus they still come out after time and need to be reset into my ear . If they are not supposed to go down into my ear , then they should have designed then to stay better outside the ear . I will give them this though , the sound quality is pretty good for earbud headphones . But what good are they if you can't hear the sound because they keep falling out . Stay away from this product .. I only hope that Philips either retools this product or drops it completely . And Nike should reconsider association with Philips if they don't .  
2	  I purchased this microphone to record a video on YouTube . It was easy to use , and has good video and audio quality . Plus , the price was very reasonable . I can recommend it highly .  
1	  I bought a Bravo II in 2006 . Very obtuse to understand and set-up . Buggy software . Many fights with the machine to get a job done . After a couple of years , wouldn't print properly .. color ink would print one good one and then following jobs didn't have correct color ( i.e. aqua logo only rusty red ) . I replaced wiper blades , repeatedly put in new ink cartridges ( very expensive ) , many calls to tech support , sent unit back last winter for repair and it came back with same printing problems . Burns DVDs fine , although sometimes there is a bunch of stop / starting to get it to work , but the printer is totally unreliable . It has provided me many hours of frustration . Tech support was poor and unable to correct problems , therefore providing me with many more hours of frustration . It is clunky , crappy , and unreliable . Expensive , too . Where is a reliable alternative for Mac OS ?  
1	  This replacement battery does not fit into the phone 's battery compartment as well as the original - it 's smaller and doesn't sit securely . The item arrived with no power and it took at least a week to charge up in the phone caddy . Shipping from Amazon was slow , however the ( expensive ) express shipping option was not selected . After about a month the phone finally seems to be back in proper working order . Too soon to tell about battery life .  
2	  You can buy cheaper brackets which accomplish the same thing , but they won't look as good as these . They were easy to install and work perfectly allowing you to aim the speakers to any point in the room with little effort .  
1	  The camera was nice for the month it worked .. I got it for my graduation right before college and it never even made it to school . I went to an outdoor concert and was taking pictures when it started to drizzle . I put it in my purse immediately . It could not have gotten that wet , yet it began to act funky later that evening , the buttons were all doing different things than they were supposed to . For a while it only tuned on when it was plugged in and you hit the on button about five times , eventually it wouldn't turn on anymore . Because it was considered water damage the warranty wouldn't cover it and I 'm out a camera . The screen was great and the pictures it did manage to take were ok , but sometimes turned out pixely , not what I would have expected even from a 5.1 megapixel camera . Unless you are planning to have this camera encased in magical protective gear forever , I would avoid it .  
1	  Like most of my electronics , I baby them . This radar detector sat on my dashboard or was placed in the comfort of its fancy foam-lined steel case when not in use . After six months , the detector croaked . I mailed it back to Beltronics with the Amazon receipt and received a letter stating that it would cost $ 60 to repair . Baffled , I called Beltronics only to be told that Amazon is not an authorized reseller . The customer service woman was very rude and condescending . I hung up and bought the latest and greatest Valentine directly from their website .  
1	  My mouse is jerky and simply freezes from time to time . The keyboard is out of control giving me multiple key strokes instead of just one . Some times it just stops working , and you have to unplug everything to get it reset again . In stead of saving effort and time I have extra work to pull everything out and unplug it from the computer before I can reset it .  
1	  I bought one of these and tried it in three pc 's . It did not work on any of them ! Stay away !  
1	  These disks are the worst , and I repeat , the WORST disks I have ever tried before . Only about 1 out of ever 15 worked . I have never had problems with any other disks , except for these . I would not recommend for anyone to waste their money on these .  
2	  This digital photo frame is the perfect way to show-off your collection of digital photos . I found the quality of display quite spectacular - they were clear and crisp . The 8 " screen size is sufficient to showcase the photos in all their glory . The remote control is a great way to play around with the frame . Even though the plastic is not exactly of great quality , it will not give away easily . The quality of music playback is quite good and adds another dimension to your photo slideshows . This frame supports almost all kinds of media cards ( USB drive , SD card , memory stick pro etc ) . The only thing that annoys me is that if I insert a USB drive , it sticks out from behind the frame . As a result , I had to invest in a $ 10 SD card . Also , the delay between two photos in slideshow mode cannot be set to less than 5 seconds . I sometimes find that too long , especially when I just want to flip through a collection . You always have the option of buying a low-range photo frame from Walmart for $ 50-60 or go for the high-range ones for $ 180-200 , like Philips . But this frame is a definite winner in the mid-range category .  
2	  Just received this mount last night . Actual install time was about 30 minutes . It took almost twice as long to unwire , and move old entertainment system . Having installed many wall mounts for LCD and Plasma tvs , this is the sturdiest of SINGLE STUD mounts that I have seen . At 22 LBS . this mount is massive . When fully extended to 20 " this mount was as sturdy as when it was flat against the wall . All bolts worked , lags were very secure , and there was zero tilt-wobble-rattle of the mount at any time . I highly reccomend this mount to anyone .  
1	  Seriously think that the companies are paying people to stuff good comments . I bought a rather expensive set around 150 from this company at another site . That model is more powerful but the base is always too much ; even when turning it all the way down . So after a year it won't power up . I went for a cheap option and CA was the only alternative for me at staples . After opening the box ; found out this thing has no power switch . You turn it on and off by unplugging it from the wall . Unfortunately ; our trade laws keep many good products from Germany and Japan out of our markets . In the future , will try not to buy anything made or sponsored by a U.S. or Chinese company .. just not worth my hard earned cash . Will take this CA-3080 back tomorrow for a credit and buy a decent pair of headphones off the internet ? Be warned ; these speakers are basic garbage that will not last .. second frustration with this company . Sadly , most U.S. companies think they should be able to extort another buy every few years from planned obsolescence .  
2	  I am not a huge fan of excessive bass in headphones . For me many of the sealed cans offer a less than desirable listening experience . I own a pair of EH-250 's and like them for a few songs then suddenly listening fatigue sets due to the overpowering bass . My EH350 's are better but I absolutely need a sealed set of cans . My perceptions about sealed cans changed the minute I put the HD215 's over my ears . Sound Quality : I immediately noticed how great the soundstage is on these phones . They provide a very expanded sense of spatial placement , especially for sealed cans . This was the first drastic improvement over the midsized cans I own . The next thing I noticed is how well presented all the mid and high frequencies are . These phones provide vocals and acoustic arrangments very desireable traits such as great detail and transient repsonse often missing from cheaper phones . Having said all that , I do have to point out the bass is ever so slightly shy . Litterally a 2db parametric bass adjustment makes it perfect for me and improves the linearity of the phones . Honestly the rated frequency response for my Iriver H320 is 20 .. 20,000hz + / - 2db and usually amps shy the bass away when the volume is turned up because it is the most demanding part of the music . So the adjustment may be for the phones and maybe for the MP3 player either way 2db is perfect . A breif note on the bass ; although less pesent than many phone out there , the extreme amount of detail in the bass reproduction makes some of my other aforementioned phones almost seem muddy . These babies are clean sounding and responsive to very deep bass notes . I love hearing all the hidden detail in the bass and these phones provide me with the deepest growls and transient response for this price range . Construction : These babies are top notch . Designed with professional use in mind they are built tough . I have heard poeple complain about plastic exteriors but honestly plastics are fast becoming superior to metal products in durability , tensile strenghth , and price . I don't use the swivel on the right earpiece but it does function as stated . Comfort : I place listening fatigue over pressure and weight at all times because I have phones I can keep on my head for hours but I am forced to take breaks due to listening fatigue . Next I consider how comfortable they are when properly adjusted for headsize and seal . I have to say these phones shine in both areas . Well designed lightweight and circumural design does wonders for these phones . I often listen for 4 hours or more at a time . Efficiency : Yes they are 32 ohm and they do have a 112db sensitivity rating but they do like a little extra power than other similarly rated pones . If you have a power saving ( lasts more than 10 hours on two AA bateries or worse yet a single AA ) cd or mp3 player you will not get the sound these babies can provide and should look elsewhere . Besides why pay more for the cans than the source which is a common mistake in the marketplace . Remember processing comes from the device NOT the phones , they simply reproduce the signal that is fed into them . Bad source always equals bad sound . A reveiwer below obviosly fell into the misconseption that better phones always provide better sound . Summary : Great dynamics and transient response win out over slightly soft but extremely well defined bass . No listening or comfort fatigue . Great sound attenuation . Exception spatialization and great construction make these phones a very good value . Don't buy if : You want the overemphasized bass other cheaper options will provide . Like the EH250 's or the HD212 's . You don't need a sealed can . there are far more options in open aire full sized designs from Sennheiser that can sound better . You have a cheap portable source . Get an Iriver Hxx series or the slighly less good sounding Ipod or Creative Labs for a portable unit . Something that can truly supply a good 10-12mW at 32ohms . Final thoughts : These cans take about 15-20 hours to break in properly so expect them to sound slightly bright and lacking in the bass at first . Once they break in they are warmer sounding and much better balanced .  
1	  the first couple of these worked like a charm and then i began to hit a streak of 5 dvd 's that wouldn't burn at all . if you want to pay for a 25 pack and only get 6 out of it that work then this is the product for you .  
2	  I love this knife , it fits well in my hand , it is very sharp and the perfect size for most cutting jobs .  
1	  I was able to play only one of five DVDs I made on this machine . When recording from an attached video camera , everything looked fine , picture appeared on TV going through the DVD / VCR , Record light is nicely lit , after finishing the DVD it played well on the Samsung . But when trying to play back either on my Sony Vaio or my Apple iMac , all I get is a soundless black picture . When I recorded on DVD-RW from a videotape inserted in the VCR , I could play the result on my Sony . But the next tape I recorded only caused Microsoft to keep asking me to send an error report when I tried to play it on my Sony . My Apple refused to recognize it as a DVD . Unpredictably incompatible . When I called the Samsung helpdesk they told me to call the computer manufacturer . I guess I would have to call both Sony and Apple then ? Crutchfield was the seller for this product and they actually have a very helpful helpdesk - by the name of Darren - According to him I should try a different brand DVD disc . I tried Memorex instead of the Office Depot and found that this brand of disc solved the problem . Question for Samsung : Why don't you have this on your troubleshooting page in the manual ? Why does the dealer know this , but you don't ?  
2	  Ok , so recently I stepped on my Earhugger A1000 Action Wrap Headphones . Unfortunately , they sounded good and fit really well . When I went back to BL they were all out . So I tried a pair of RPHS34 headphones by Panasonic ( my review didn't go through and don't feel like writing another one ) . They sound good and fit well but leaked way too much sound . So I ordered a pair of JVC earbuds on Amazon which I will review when they arrive . So on to these Koss P3 earbuds . I didn't buy them . These came with a set of big Koss headphones and since my friend can't stand earbuds , they passed these up to me . Hey , how can I pass down something that 's free ? Since they were really cheap and the reviews for these were bad I expected these to suck but really these are some good earbuds given the low price . I tried these on some of my music and sounded pretty good , not great but much better than others claim . Just with the EQ off these sounded good . The bass is actually pretty rich to me comparing the Sony MDRE828LP and the Earhugger A1000 . These don't provide near as much bass as those that cost much more but do sound good enough for their purchase . Mids sounded fine , But as with most of the cheaper earbuds I noticed a bit much in the 200-500k range . These also provide a good lcean sound to them , you don't hear fantastic detail but you can hear most of which comes out of your tunes . Overall , above average sound quality . Not excelling in anything but not failing in anything . I 've also heard that these are too big . Yes , they are larger than most , but with the provided pads on them they fit my rather SMALL ears just fine . These aren't for running or excercising , if you are looking for something on that matter you may want to pick up the Koss KSC22 or the Sony MDRJ10 . These don't fall out when walking but any vigorous activity will just not work with these headphones . One thing you MUST know is about the lifetime warranty . Yes , they come with the lifetime warranty . But unless you bought these in the pack with the big headphones , the warranty is pretty useless since you have ot send in five bucks to get them repair . Somewhat a ripoff if you look at the price listing for these seperately . Overall , a good middle of the road chose for those looking for somethnig with good sound and are comfortable and don't want to spend a ton . They are no where near the best headphones you can buy , nor are they the best sub ten , but for a cheap and well suitable replacement for your iPod or other portable player , these are it . 4 stars .  
2	  Granted , there are better players , but not at this price range . Skipping : I 've only had it skip twice with mp3 CDs , both times were from really poor roads + really poor alignment on my car . So no fault to the ChromeX . Now , it skips occaisionally with audio CDs . The mp3 CDs just work better . It 's like the audio CD portion was just thrown in as a bonus for people who still listen to those . Construction : Okay , it looks cheap , it feels cheap , it probably is cheap . But , it 's fallen from 4-5 feet to hit hard ground a couple of times ( I 'm not the most graceful person in the world ) , and fallen off my dashboard a few times ( gotta outrun those cops chasing me for playing my music too loud ) , it still works . The LCD screen is in perfect condition . Another thing is the plastic is really , actually , hard to scratch . O.S. : Obscenely easy . So easy , that the manual would have been fine if it only came in pdf or something like that . Gripes are reserved for the scrolling " effect . " It 's obnoxious . It doesn't scroll , it magically appears , disappears , appears with new text , then disappears again , et cetera . I HATE THE SCROLLING " EFFECT . " My friend has a RioVolt ( oldest one ) which IS an iRiver CD-Mp3 Player ( with a changed logo ) , and it scrolls ( with moving characters from right to left ) like a PC or Mac . Oh , and you can only have 64 characters in a title , which may seem like alot , but a paticular band I listen to has ( lot 's of ) song titles that are 80-90 characters ( " And Lo , When The Imperium Marches Against Gul-Kothoth , Then Dark Sorceries Shall Enshroud The Citadel Of The Obsidian Crown " 123 characters ) . I know these don't really matter , but they bug me . Overall : It 's the best Mp3-CD player for this money , hands down . My couple of meaningles gripes aside . iRiver ought fix the scrolling " effect " in the next OS upgrade .  
1	  This might be a good product but . What size is it ? Are the selves adjustable ? What is it made of ? This and many more questions I would have before I would buy it .  
1	  I cancelled my TIVO service 11 months ago and TIVO continued charging me and now is claiming that they will only reimburse me for up to 3 months . What a ripoff company . BEWARE !  
2	  I got this cable to run from my computer to my monitor . It works great so far . It 's the prefect size for me . I have my desktop on the bottom level of my desk with my monitor on the mid level of the desk . The cable seems like it 's well built . The connector ends ( dvi & hdmi ) are a little bit , but nothing very crazy . All in all , I would recommend this cable for simple video only applications , like a computer monitor , etc .  
1	  This iTrip didn't match the connectors in our 30Gb iPod .  
1	  Do not purchase this phone system unless you enjoy the sound of " white noise " during telephone conversations . There is a constant hissing noise from the ear piece whenever the phone is being used . . . Please take heed to similiar reviews on this phone and save yourself the hassle and expense of having to return it !  
2	  This TV is an unbelievable deal . I love mine . I bought several of them for my business . Everyone who has seen them thinks it cost a lot more than they do . Flat screen is the only way to go . It has all of the inputs needed for DVD or a dish . The remote is easy to use and the picture is awsome . You will not regret buying this .  
2	  Title says it all . I use it to trigger my D700 while doing tripod work . I bought a cheaper cable on ebay first and patted myself on the back for saving money . It worked .. at first . Then it did a weird thing - each time I plugged it in , it would disable the rear LCD . I couldn't use it for live view , reviewing pictures , making menu settings , etc .. Finally , the cord stopped working at all . Oh well . I finally bit the bullet and bought the MC-30 . There 's not much to it , but It works flawlessly and has a nice feel in the hand . I just wish it were $ 20 cheaper and about 1 foot longer .  
2	  I bought this for my Mom for a Mother 's Day gift , she loved it and said it works great .  
2	  The box has shown itself to work well for photos taken with my 5MP digital snapshot camera ( nothing fancy ) using a combination of the provided lights and the built-in flash . It took some playing around with light position to make sure no shadows . But , once I did , the pictures were really clean with night color and light balance . An extra light would help for some bigger items , but I used a task light for that , and it worked fine ( the color is not the same as the halogens , but since I was using for behind the object , it made no difference ) . The whole thing folds up and the lights fit into a pouch . This is useful for storage and carrying . The backdrop can be reversed to get two possible colors . The backdrop cloth is heavy duty and looks good in the picture ( no blotches ) . It drapes well , which is important . I think this works as well as the far more expensive ones of the same size . Only word of advice : check the size and what you will be photographing . I found some items were too big .  
2	  I use these disks in my iomega REV drive to back up my PC . They work as expected .  
1	  We have ruined two microwaves using this popper . After the first microwave burned up ( using the microwave popper ) we thought that because the popper was several years old we needed a new one . So , we bought a new microwave and a new popper . We used both for about 6 months and the same thing happened . It 's the Presto popper ! And I have had to buy two new microwaves ! When my mother 's microwave burned out I asked her if she had been using the Presto popper and she said that she had . It has now burned out 3 microwaves . I do not feel that it is safe and will not buy another .  
1	  CaseLogic advertises this as ' Fits devices : 6 " x 3.75 " x 1.25 " ' with a ' Size : 6.25 " x 4.5 " x 1.7 " ' on their website . This is quite an error . We purchased one from Amazon . com but the interior space is only 5.3 " x 3.4 " . So our hard drive did not quite fit . Since this is a hard case , that made the case useless for us . So be warned about this error on the CaseLogic website . Amazon . com kindly refunded our money . Later addition : Amazon . com does sell hard case that fits larger portable hard drives and also has the exact inside dimensions advertised on their website . This is theACI HandStands 16804 - Hard case for GPS / hard disk drive / camera - bluewhich you will see I rated with five stars .  
2	  Cool retro design . The case does secure the entire camera , but tough to handle if you don't have it on your belt .  
2	  I 've had my camera for serveral weeks now and I 'm generally happy with it . This is my first digital camera . Some of my learning has been trial and error . The owners guide could use some help . The camera is taking great pictures and is easy to use with the auto setting . I 'm slowly using some of the manual settings . The movie mode was important to me . I bought a 1GB memory stick . It gives me enough memory for family events with still shots and movies . The quality of the movie was important and I 'm happy to say we have nice movies from this camera . Indoors becomes very challenging because of lighting issues in the movie mode . I 'm not sure yet if I can make an adjustment or not . Outdoors the camera take great movies for a still camera . For the price and features I 'm very happy and would recommend this camera to any beginner .  
1	  The reason why I am giving this Coby Digital picture frame keychain only two stars is because it is not Mac compatible if you are using Leopard - Mac OS X 10.5 . If you have a system running Tiger - Mac OS X 10.4 - as I luckily have , you will have no problems using this Keychain . It seems to me that Coby 's support is just a twee bit lacking . However , I find little fault with the chain itself . I think the quality of the LCD display is more than acceptable , and it 's simple enough to use . What I do not like about the keychain is that you have to tell it to charge the battery once you plug it into the included USB chord ( which , of course , needs to be plugged into your computer , too ) . That should be automatic , IMHO . Also , while it is charging , it endlessly cycles through it 's stored pictures . On a frame this small , that just seems a waste .  
1	  I had this camera for one week and then I dropped and it hit the edge of my desk and then I caught it . It would not work at all and it cost more to ship it to Fuji than to buy a new one . Also I couldn't find the warranty card they swore I should have even though I didn't throw anything away . It was nice for the week it lasted , but definately not worth it .  
2	  I 'm really impressed with the Sansa . It 's tiny , solidly built , and has some great features that competing products don't . It plays videos , has great sound quality , has expandable memory , has an FM Tuner , and has a built in mic for recording audio . The interface is easy to use and the controls are simple . The scroll wheel works well but the movement could be just a little bit smoother . Overall I would definitely recommend this player to anyone looking for a small , easily portable flash-based audio player .  
1	  You are better off building your own computer out of parts from the 80 's because that 's basically what you will be getting . Where to start with what is wrong with Dell , customer support ( they will argue with you ) , hardware failure ( if it works right the first time count yourself lucky ) , the motherboard - you get what you pay for remember that , and if you do not upgrade then there will be NO slot available for upgrading later , and the funny thing is that it will work for about four months then the problems start . And as for their printers , RUN don't walk away , RUN far ans fast .  
2	  I got this laptop when I returned to college . I absolutely love it ! I love the sleek design , and easy to use keys . I spend many hours a day on it , and it never seems to overheat .  
2	  I use Team Speak and this set works GREAT ! mic is in a good place , team mates tell me i they can hear me much better now ( is that a good thing ? ) , head phones sound great ! i would recomend these to ANYONE doing any kind of online gaming in use with any team chat software . GREAT PURCHASE for under $ 20 .. retail website has these for $ 40  
1	  This is definitely one of the most cheaply priced 15 ' USB cables on the market . Now that I 've opened the plastic wrap , I now know that this is also the thinnest USB cable that I 've ever seen . This makes me wonder about the quality and whether it 's actually going to support reliable USB 2.0 speeds , especially in an environment with interference . I 'm only giving this two stars because I think that the product page should have been honest and explicitly said something about the thinness of the cable . I certainly didn't lose much money , but I wouldn't buy this again , and I 'll probably replace it with a thicker cable from a better known company . You get what you pay for .  
1	  Got theses for an old camcorder , The batteries work fine for about five months then they started to leak .. ughh waste of $ # 1  
2	  This printer was a .. bargain for me after .. rebate ( which I still HOPE to receive ) . It is loud , but I don't live in a museum or a library so I don't really care . It takes a while to heat up after sitting idle when you need to print - how often do you need to print any way ? The speed of this puppy is mind boggling , and I 'm spoiled by network printers ( albeit now Xerox network printers instead of HP at work ) . No USB cable comes w / it , but check out your local Costco / Price Club . They sell a sweet USB cable 3-pack .. P>My only complaint is that you can only get one perfectly aligned print-out at a time . It is not a very significant skew - you don't lose data off the page - but it is noticeable . Most of my output consists of maps and directions , which are for my own use and have a short shelf life anyway . However , if you plan to turn this output over to a customer , think twice . I WILL say that I can get a single perfectly aligned print-out when I press the paper in the tray down until the paper tensioner locks . I had a certificate to print out and it came out perfectly . I would also like to mention that the envelope feeder ate my 1st envelope for lunch . The second went through OK but the radius of the drum is so small that ( along w / the heat from the fuser ) you end up with a somewhat " distressed " looking envelope . Again , I don't think you 'd want to pass this to a customer ( at least not a paying one ) , but for personal use - and that 's what this printer is for , eh ? - the printer works fine  
2	  Now this is not the most exciting keyboard , but I have no complaints . I use a Logitech gaming keyboard on my main computer , but the bedroom desktop needed a new keyboard and this one fit the bill . Good , solid , worth the money .  
2	  Remember that the lens that you are cleaning with this awesome lens cleaner is far more expensive than this cleaner itself . Therefore , no amount of caring while cleaning the lens is enough . Happy photography :) I love this cleaning pen .  
2	  I live 36 miles from Mt Wilson in the LA area and this little guy picks up over 100 digital channels . The HD PQ is much cleaner then Sat . and the audio has much more punch and better surround . If I wasn't a sports nut I would cut the cable on Sat . The signal you get on your major network channels is recieved totaly uncompressed . Also , this a UHF antenna but I get all the VHF channels with 80-98 % signal strength . ( I have it mounted in my attic ) Why spend more , this little baby is a winner .  
2	  This is my second set of ety 's , unfortunately I lost the first . However , I couldn't imagine listening through " regular " headphones so I bought another pair . I fly a lot for work and after debating ety 's or the noise cancelling Bose , my audiophile friend said there was no comparison . The joy of flying on the plane with no engine noise is unbeatable and makes for a much better flight . Sound is crisp and sharp , like a symphony playing in your head . Yes , it actually sounds like the whatever you are listening to is coming from your skull . It may seem expensive to drop over $ 100 for ear buds in lieu of cans , but you won't regret it , these are worth every penny .  
1	  I 've read that as 1st generation CD-MP3 players go , this is one of the best . After buying this unit twice , I have to say I 'll wait until the technology improves . I purchased the sport version of this player ( with the waist pack & water resistant casing ) . I used it 4-5 times a week while exercising for the last two months . Here are the problems I 've encountered : first player bought 12/1/01 , returned 12/27/01:1 . CD-R 's - sound is good , pauses frequently for varying durations ( up to 5 minutes ) - ESP button blinks . When ESP is turned off , cd skips & cracks constantly - not listenable in this mode . 2 . MP3 's - sound not great - slow startup ( processing ) time , very frequent pauses , often stops running . ESP blinks continuously . Divides tracks in odd locations - sometimes a 5 minute song would be divided into 6 tracks - including the pause while it tries to read the next track ( very frustrating ) . 3 . CDA 's ( store bought CD 's ) - sound is good , pauses when batteries start to get low . Unfortunatly , I was able to get about 1-3 hours of listening time from 1 set of batteries . 4 . Returned because volume dial malfunctioned . Decided to give this player one more try . second player bought 12/27/01 , returned 2/6/02:1 . All of the above problems multiplied by 2 . If Memorex can't make a consistant product , I will buy something else . 2 . Battery door sometimes would come partially open throwing the CD off balance and causing the player to go into ESP ( skip mode ) . I 'm giving up on CD-MP3 player technology for awhile . There are way too many frustrating bugs out there that need to be worked out .  
2	  While I have been very impressed with this unit 's features , I think it can't be stated enough for prospective buyers , this unit comes with an essentially worthless basemap that does NOT offer street routing . Expect to spend an additional 130 $ to make the unit useful in your car for routing . Otherwise , I highly recommend the 60CSx . My first GPS and it 's packed full of easily learned features .  
2	  These headphones are as stated precision and comfortable to boot . You will notice every nuance and deviation from the norm for the music being played , flat as a pancake . Sweet ! But there is a lot of music out there poorly done . I 'm likin um !  
1	  I took this floppy drive out of the box and plugged the USB cable into my computer . When I inserted a floppy my computer said it was not formatted . When I attempted to remove the floppy , the eject button doesn't work . When you press on it , the floppy moves inside the drive but not enough to self-eject or to allow you to grasp it to pull it out . This was a total waste of my time .  
1	  I have some Shure earphones and there 's no way they would be able to fit in this thing . I should 've considered the size rather than looking at the pictures .  
2	  Short and sweet , i bought a xact for my first radio , xr8 ( wrong move ) never again . the xact radio and the service was the same SORRY.I highly recommend the st2 . never a minutes problem with this fine unit . Best regrads Jon Tabor in Norfolk Va .  
2	  This is a MUST HAVE ! for those of you like me who have purchased the telephoto lens for your Z712IS digital . You will not be able to add the lens to your camera without it . It works flawlessly and it adds a new dimension to your photographic ability . Wayne  
1	  i 've had my ziotek for 3 years now when i still had my widows xp . i was able to use this for a few months then our system broke down . we bought a new pc and widows 7 was already out a couple of years now and i never had a chance using this since the driver won't work on widows 7 . i just checked cyberguys . com where i bought it originally and it says it should work on widows 7 since they already fixed it and downloaded the zip file and uploaded it in my computer . Guess what ? still doesn't work and it 's still giving me a ridiculous error message . i regret spending 100 + on this device . don't waste your money on this !  
1	  apparently several thousand faulty units were distributed . i received a faulty one , sent it back , and the replacement was faulty also . this was not operator malfunction , customer support informed me of this issue . i stay away from belkin products from now on .  
2	  Not the most well built tripod but it works well . As a hobbyist photographer I purchased this tripod for my Canon T2i . It holds the camera well in portrait and landscape modes . The levels are accurate and setup and breakdown are fairly simple . The drawback is the head on the tripod is made of all plastic so it doesn't feel as durable as the more expensive tripods . The tilt and portrait tilt don't hold as well as I would like but none the less it still holds . If your looking for a tripod to experiment with , this is a good start . I bought it to travel with and use at home when I need one . It will get me by till I can afford a more expensive one .  
2	  This camera takes very clear pictures with outstanding quality . In Peru , the quality of shots - both in bright light and at night were outstanding . The only caveat is the fragile nature of the cover lid . After dropping the camera twice , I had to take the cover lid to a repair shop . It 's so expensive to repair ( almost $ 100 ) - the same price as a new camera . If you buy this camera , invest in a protective cover so it can be cushioned during falls ..  
1	  .. in this day and age create a device so ugly ? I don't understand . I looks like it was made in the 70s . When you buy that kind of " toy " , the kind you take with you everywhere and show to everyone , you can expect it to look nice . This is just awful ! Brown ? Ew ! Go figure !

1	  I read the reviews for both the " silent " and non-silent version of this power supply and decided to spend the extra cash for the quiet version . The silent power supply functions fine , but it is by no means silent or even quiet . It 's very loud . I can't imagine how loud the non-silent version is . The stock powersupply that came with my PC 's case was much much quieter than this " silent " coolmax . If I had it to do over again , I would buy something else . I may even shop around for another and just keep the Coolmax as a spare .  
2	  Most of the reviews I read before I bought this case seemed to have been written by men , who tend to be more interested in function than form , so if you 're into aesthetics , this is for you . Initially , I wanted to find a case that was more stylish , but this was the best one I could find , and I really like the way it looks . My husband ( who knows that things can get a little knocked around in my purse ) was leaning toward something a little more heavy duty , but the LCM-THA has done a great job protecting my camera . I like that it 's not too bulky , since , clearly , the DSC-T7 looks cool because it 's so thin . I feel like my camera is safe and secure , but hasn't lost its coolness .  
2	  I have just put in this cartridge , and so far so good . I saved a lot of money - hope it lasts .  
1	  I bought this and it was awesome for about a month and then the switch started messing up I had to have the switch turned just right like between monitor selections in order to get the video signal through . I would steer clear of this switch and spend a little more on a better one .  
1	  The first and so far the only pack of 25 Maxwell DVD-RW 's I have opened contained DVD 's that were unusable . The DVD blanks would not record , over fifteen of them had to be thrown away . I have not contacted the vendor since I no longer have that info handy , but I will research it and contact him ( or her ) . So far the few DVD 's that did record , when played back , the DVD froze ever few minutes , making it unwatchable and so unusable . I have not opened the other three packs of 25 Maxwell DVD 's I purchased , but anticipate the identical thing happening with them . Something is very wrong here . Aren't DVD 's tested before being sent from the factory ? Dr. J.W. Durrah  
2	  This broadband router is great for WAN links of 6Mb or less which makes it perfectly suited for broadband DSL or Cable . If you intend to use it as a firewall on a 10MB network , you will run into intermittent problems of major packet loss . It appears that the internal backplane can't handle above 6Mb / sec . Other than that , the web GUI interface is easy to follow and any simpleton can set it up . It supports PPoE for those of you unfortunate enough forced to log in to your DSL / Cable provider , as well as dynamic and static addressing . The firewall does a good job of port blocking , allows setup of a DMZ via port pass through , but does not do any packet filtering . It does shut down microsoft vulnerabilities when file folder sharing is turned on ( on your local computer ) . It also effectively nullifies DOS ( Denial Of Service ) attacks based on ping-flooding , if enabled . For the average home user / gamer , this will be a perfect fit . For the Business user you may want to seriously consider a higher end firewall with NAT and packet filtering if you want to protect database servers and other important eyes-only data .  
2	  The good : Great pictures , compact ergonomic design - classy . So far I am pleased with the camera . The bad : I am annoyed that Minolta choose not to package an AC adapter with this camera . Further - how about mentioning this little detail in the advertising so those purchasers like myself could order it . Here I am back at the Amazon site and guess what - no sign of the AC adapter - probably another $ 50 when I find one . Minolta even recommends this option ( per their manual ) when connecting to a computer !  
2	  I LOVE my little new toy . I was debating to get this or Canon SD600 , both in the same price range and same megapixel . After doing a lot of research online and seeing the actual models in store , I decided to get this one and I am really glad I did . What I really like about this camera so far : 1 . the optical image stabilization really works wonder ! at least for me who used to get a lot of fuzzy pix from my old fuji . I was able to get a too good to be true pix of my cat yearning in motion ! This may not work for everything ( if there 's a lot of jittering / shaking ) but it sure works for what I was looking for ( without compromising the quality ) . One of the most common probs with compact cameras is jittering / shaking hands , and this certainly takes care that for you ! 2 . GREAT battery life , which is what I really love and care about . I was able to point and shoot over 100 pix so far ( half of them with flash , though not consecutively ) and plus some video clicks and still have full battery signal on . It 's amazing ! I also compared the battery life with the canon sd600 online .. it 's about double according to some standard . 3 . Nice LCD . For those of you who might be worried about missing the viewfinder on this toy , the battery life certainly makes up for it ( plus the viewfinder usually doesn't get you 100 % of the actual picture anyway ) . Some review said that LCD playback quality is not as good , but I find no problem with it . ( from a pair of non-prof / average eyes , that is ) 4 . Very user-friendly . I didn't really need to read manual to figure out most features of the camera . I just got it on the hand for less than 2 days and I am already feeling like a pro with this camera . 5 . fast start-up and little shutter lag ~ which is also important to me . 6 . a lot of features . allow you to quickly change to different scene modes / effects . Some cons that I can think of : 1 . I think maybe some people will think brands like Canon has better image quality ? I don't have a new model Canon to compare with but with the previous models ( in Canon & Fuji ) , I can't tell much difference . ( looks great to me for what I can tell ) 2 . No optical viewfinder ( for the people who really want to have viewfinder ) . 3 . the size of the camera is a little bigger than SD600 ( and cannot compare to credit-card size casio Ex-Z60 . though this can be a pro & con depending on each individual 's preference . I have small / medium hands and the camera feels just fine ( I was able to use one hand to navigate the bottoms / menu and to take pix ) . But I can see probs with bigger hands4 . the control bottoms are kind of small ( which is typical in compact cameras ) . Again , might be problematic with bigger hands . * Over all , for the price in this range , I think this is one of the best value on market right now that has a nice package of what typical people are looking for ( user-friendly , long battery life , anti-shake , great / decent pix quality ) . You usually have to pay for an extra $ 100 to get that optical stabilization feature in other model ( i.e. Canon SD700 ) . No camera is perfect but this camera has definitely come close to that ! I 'd definitely recommend this for anyone . I just hope the magic will last me for the years to come ! have to wait to see about that !  
2	  I own a G2 also , but the ELPH is the one to slide in your pocket everytime . Light and small , but feels as sturdy as a block of steel in your hand . The video mode records 180 seconds per clip in 320 mode , not many other cameras can do this . Very fast cycle time between photos . Cons : None in 3 months  
1	  This player has serious problems with audio going out of sync on non disc video files . I bought THE player exclusively for playing back stuff like AVI and MKV only to realize that 9 out of 10 of my videos had sync problem that do not occur when playing back on the PC . It functions well enough as a DVD / Bluray player , but not much else . Samsung support did not return my email about the issue and the latest firmware doesn't fix the issue . I would not recommend this player .  
1	  I purchased this item last month . After two days of receiving the charger , it was sensitive , meaning I would need to wiggle before the connection would charge . A customer service representative contacted me in attempt to remove or alter my last review . They offered to refund or exchange the charger for removal of my review . After accepting the proposal , I removed my review . Since then , it has been three weeks and I have not received a refund or exchange . Now , the charger does not work at all , regardless of wiggling the insert piece . I would not recommend purchasing this item .  
1	  Cost 12 cost to return 6 so its a lose lose wires wont work to power a freaking light bulb  
2	  My daughter received this photo keychain for Christmas . At first the software kept crashing when I went to transfer the images from my computer ( Mac OS X ) to the keychain . I emailed Coby 's tech support and within a couple of days I received an answer with another driver attached . I installed the new software and it worked effortlessly . I am pleased with both the product and the tech support I received .  
2	  Honestly , I thought it was going to be a piece of crap . But surprisingly it wasn't . :) I lost mine like before December .. The very same model .. so , I had tobuy a new one .. :] i LOVE IT .  
2	  Frankly , with today 's gadgets , I run into the issue where I want to run my MP3 played to a computer , or into a car stereo player . This little cable really works for me ! My cable arrived in great condition , and was shipped with no issues . The cable itself has good insulation , and feels heavier than most light wires used for audio cables like this . What I really like is that it is the solid round cable , and it does not use that cheap , flimsy dual wire to connect the heads . The connectors are a nice and snug fit in all of my audio devices , and I get great sound quality from them . I really found this item to be really useful , and a great buy ! The price was awesome too !  
2	  I read all the reviews before I bought this keyboard 3 months ago . This thing is great , everything I hoped for . I haven't had any of the problems or complaints that I read about except for these two things :( 1 ) The connection was in and out and VERY annoying . This has a simple fix , moving the bluetooth USB thingy away from the computer ( I use it on a desktop ) with a short USB extension cable ( mine 's 2ft ) . Apparently , if it is too close to metal ( or a computer 's power supply ) it has trouble . I used the extension to get it a little further from my computer and it has worked perfectly since - I use my keyboard from my couch about 12ft away . ( 2 ) The keyboard has some fancy lights for shortcuts , volume control , etc . But the keys themselves do not light up , making typing in the dark tricky . For the price tag on this baby , and since there are already lights on the keyboard I think it 's pretty weak to not light up the keys , or at least use glow in the dark paint . That 's it , everything else is fantastic . I think I 've charged the thing once , even though I never turn it off . I don't mind the keyboard layout - it seems normal size to me and not especially weird . Well worth the money .  
1	  I bought this unit not much more than a month ago and everything was great at first .. great quality , great price , what more can you ask for , right ? Then last week it started getting stuck on DVDs , which I figured was just a scratched disc .. until it started doing that to brand new DVDs that had just been opened . I don't know what the defect that 's causing this is , but it 's running the DVDs super hot and causing discoloration to the discs themselves . How weird is that ? Now it 's gotten to the point where it won't load them at all , it just shows the loading screen forever . I 'm taking this back today and after reading other reviews , I 'll be getting another brand . Sidenote : the box and specs say this has a 6-head vcr , but the unit itself says it 's a 4-head , what 's up with that ?  
2	  Don't think its a high speed cable . Which I needshipping was fast . Works fine for TV just not play station in full HD .  
2	  I think the shuffle ipods are great , you can : store music easly , it 's small , I find it easy to controll and it 's quite cheap .  
2	  Apple is quite simply the best and most innovative computer manufacturer . Their various Macintosh computers are very user-friendly : easy to set up and use and ( unlike most PCs ) seldom crash or malfunction . Furthermore , the new iMac computers , although full-featured , are very compact and , thus , take up little desk space . The new iMacs all have adjustable flat-panel displays with exceptionally bright , sharp images . Now Apple has increased the processor speeds of these strikingly-attractive new iMacs and reduced their prices . This model has a big 20 " wide screen display plus a 1.25 GHz G4 processor . Please don't be put off by the fact that the processor clock-speed is " only " 1.25 GHz . The G4 processor accomplishes more than twice as much per clock cycle as Pentium 4s do and , thus , is faster than a 2.5 GHz Pentium 4 . All things considered , this new iMac is a terrific , versatile wide screen computer at a reasonable price . Highly recommended .  
1	  Ordered two of these to replace my aging stock batteries . Neither of them work . Buyer beware on these .  
2	  I 've enjoyed using this wonderful MP3 player while working out and sometimes when I have to walk somewhwere . It 's worked very well for me , but the other day it impressed the hell out of me . I had it in my pocket while I was riding my bike , and I had a little crash . I landed right on top of the thing , and it gave me a big bruise on my leg .. and I don't bruise easily . The MP3 player survived and still works perfectly , though the leather case took some damage and there are some cracks in the face . I 'm very impressed with the fact that this little thing survived the crash and I 'd reccomend this player to any who 's looking for one !  
2	  This audio / video unit is so well designed and capable of providing my every day needs , I would marry it .  
1	  I have had continued problems with this device . When it works , I like it . However , the software that comes loaded on it is not made by Sandisk-it 's a French company called Dmailer with no direct support line-you have to email them . Sandisk tried to refer me to a site to buy software when the device screwed up and refused to read my password . This has happened twice now-each time has created problems that resulted in having to reformat the device , thus losing all my documents . I would not recommend this drive-the software is nice when it works but it is too buggy and the support is awful .  
2	  I am very happy with this product . I also own a Canon EOS Digital camera but there are times when it is too large to carry . I therefore purchased the Canon PowerShot Digital Elph Camera . It is small enough to fit into my handbag ( or a man 's pocket ) yet large enough to manage the controls easily . The camera is very easy to use and takes excellent pictures - clear and true to color . There are also manual settings to allow the photographer more flexibility in composing his pictures . I highly recommend this product .  
1	  I 've gone through two of these and I 'm currently shopping for a new universal remote . One requirement I have at this point is " No Logitech " . The unit worked fine with LNS-4095 40 " Samsung TV other than the following problems : a ) Key contacts would wear out rendering function keys useless ; b ) Keys were so small that my ( average size ) male hands would quite often press two keys at a time ; c ) The contacts would become fouled which required a careful cleaning of the contacts on both the charging base and the contacts on the unit . This was very annoying in that I thought the unit was charging when in fact it was sitting there discharged ; and when I would go to use it I would find out it had no charge . Then I got a new TV . When I went to set up the new TV and remove the old TV ( Samsung LNS-4095 ) for the unit , some timing element or another seemed to hang around from the old TV set codes to the new one ( Sony KDL-52W5100 ) . Consequently the unit would never correctly switch the HDMI correctly either from or to the BD player . Imagine spending a few frustrating hours working the software only to come up blank time and time again . FYI I had the following attached to the machine : TVHD DVD PlayerBD DVD PlayerOppo upscaling DVD playerScientific Atlanta cable DVR . . . and at one point a Monoprice HDMI switch . The first unit went dead while in the warranty period and to Logitech 's credit , they faithfully replaced the faulty unit with a new one . This worked about 8 months and now I need a new unit . Because of the aforementioned problems I do not want a new Logitech unit . I would summarize that the small keys , contact problems , and some sort of programming glitch when clearing out the old TV when installing the new one , and worn-out key contacts rendering the affected key worthless are my major gripes along with the relatively short lifespan of the unit while still costing as much as it does . I do not recommend buying this at all .  
1	  The unit I received was not working properly so returned it to the supplier who was very quick to get necessary information to me for the prepaid return .  
2	  Our HP 4345MFP was beginning to print black streaks down the page , once this kit was installed everything was fine ..  
2	  When I bought this camera , was a little skeptical about Kodak but to my surprise the camera has performed above expectations . The easyshare software is pretty helpful too . I also have a compact Canon SD 1100IS but got to say I find Kodak 712 results far better . The results in low light were a little .. " low " but using this camera with a tripod during night gave better performance .  
2	  Overall this is a great camera . It 's a little overwhelming since I 'm an amateur photographer and new to DSLR 's . It 's a good idea to spend some time reading the manual and fully understanding all the camera 's capabilities & settings . The camera takes wonderful pictures . The only downside is the camera 's tendency to underexpose pictures & make them a little dark . I have found you must have a good flash like the SB-600 ( or SB-800 ) to truly make this camera great .  
2	  I bought this case for my son 's camera . It is the perfect fit and it is nice and slim so he can still put the camera in his pocket . He takes it a lot of places so sometimes it is in his backpack which gets thrown all over the place and sometimes it is in his pocket . I was worried about protecting the camera so bought this case for it . It is very nice , looks great and gives it the extra protection we were looking for . There is no storage space , however , so if you are looking to store extra cards or batteries , this is not the one for you . I did read that someone stored an extra battery in the blet clip . It will fit there , but could fall out if banged around . Otherwise , I would highly recommend this case .  
1	  Boombox was ok right of the box . The problem is the unit is poor quality . My unit has never even moved off my desk since its purchase . Here we are 7 months later and the sound has quit working . Delphi warranties the thing for a year , but its a big hassle . They should just exchange the unit right away . You just can't go turn another radio on when you using satellite .  
2	  Takes great pics and the 3 " screen is REALLY nice . Wall plug in recharger is nice also . I have taken pics outside in sunny , overcast , & rainy conditions . Indoors at sporting events and around the house . In all settings the pics have been truly wonderful . A few instances of blurriness caused by an unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics . However , as Canon 's top of the line Powershot commanding a higher dollar price this camera really should have a higher optical zoom . 3x isnt enough when other , cheaper cameras have 6x optical zoom . Also Image Stabilzation should be included .  
2	  This cleaner is a cleaning machine . It does what it 's designed to do . I clean my discs from Netflix before I watch them & never have a problem . This thing works great ! Highly recommended .  
1	  I bought three of these DVD players and returned all of them . I charged the batteries and then left them for a week . We got on the plane and I was going to put the movies on for my three kids and all of the DVD players wouldn't turn on . I then thought that maybe you need to charge them the night before you are going to use them . When we got to our destination I was going to charge them to make sure they worked . Well .. it wouldn't charge them . A horrible product . I am back now trying to figure out a decent dvd player .  
1	  I received one of these as a fathers day gift . In looking at the box I thought ' how neat ' . I could hardly wait to try it out . I grabbed the memory card out of my 5 mega-pixel camera that had the latest pictures of my twin babies and slapped it into the frame . The disappointment started immediately after fliping the switch to ' on ' . The screen flickered and fluttered as it displayed the firmware version . I could hardly read the combination of numbers and letters . After that its start-up menu showed and I had to check to see if I was wearing my glasses . Yep , I was . I started looking around for a focus button or knob . Nope , no such thing . I thought to myself ' what could be wrong ' . I fumbled through the directories on my memory card and found a picture . It took a few seconds adn then the picture showed on the screen . It looked horible . I knew that it was not a problem with the picture . It was a picture that I had just printed a day or two earlier . My hard copy looks great ! The display on the Royal PF56 was blury and out of focus . I tried a few more pictures and then gave up . The box shows a picture of the frame displaying a great looking picture . A picture nowhere near what it would really look like on the frame . I 'd call it false advertising . Big disappointment .  
2	  1 ) Very light , less ear fatigue than any other I 've used , even less than the lightest mobile phone bluetooth headsets . 2 ) Doesn't make your ear hot . 3 ) Extremely clear sound with volume wheel that can go both much quieter and much louder than desired . 4 ) Paperclip switchable hi and low Microphone gain settings . The high microphone gain setting can be used to boost your outgoing audio volume so people on the other end of the line can hear you well . The best setting hi / low depends on your phone . Overall this is an excellent headset !  
2	  I have had a number of cutting edge DVD players over the years , sadly paying thousands for a picture that is inferior to the Oppo ! This players images are incredible - when hooked up to my Pioneer Kuro TV , the images are very smooth , film-like with incredibly deep blacks and no motion artifacts . It would be hard to come up with a player that is close to this for the money and one could make the argument that this is a superior player to existing HD and Blu-Ray players out there ( I know , I have a blu-ray and have been underwhelmed with the slow response time and software implementation ) .  
1	  I bought my Canon S500 in April 2004 and have not even bothered to look over the reviews since my purchase as a result of my seeming satisfaction with this item . Well , I just returned from London where , of course , I experienced the E18 problem with associated lens retraction issues . Since I carry my camera in my pocket , I assumed that somehow I had inadvertently powered up the camera . It is only now that I realize that this is a consistent problem with the camera occurring almost 18 months to the date noted in prior reviews . Thanfully , I have an extended warranty but would be seriously upset if I had to come up with additional money to repair what is obviously an inherent manufacturer 's technical issue . The seeming lack of concern on the part of Canon to address this issue easily earns this item 1 star review .  
2	  My project is this : Taking the image from my PS3 and splitting it using the " HDMI Splitter Amplifier 1 In to 2 Out Dual Display . " That image would show up on two TVs ( one is a 720p TV the other is a 1080p ) . The same image shows up perfectly on both . As far as audio , I ran a different cable for that , however audio DOES travel through this 25ft HDMI cable perfectly ( if you need that for your project ) . I 'm a little surprised that there 's no image-loss through 25ft of cable .. that 's a long way , especially traveling through my HDMI Splitter . Hope this helps ! - Chevassus StudiosP . s . DO NOT buy the crazy-expensive cables from Best Buy or Radio Shack . This is THE best price I found on the internet . You won't regret getting this cable .  
1	  I recently bought this item only to be greatly disappointed . Terrible item in every respect . Technical problems and cheap construction are my biggest concerns . Save your money and buy a better system , because all this is good for is the trash .  
1	  it was a great price at the time and it works perfectly in the master bedroom .. where it gets about 45 mintues of use a day in the morning .. and occassionally when I am in bed sick or playing insomnia boy . I have not had too many issues , but there are two major problems .. the hum from the speakers is unreal , especially when the volume is turned down . The second issue is that the remote stopped working . It just stopped . I have changed the batteries twice and still nothing . The bad part is , I cannot find ANY universal remotes that will work with it . If anyone knows one that will .. post it please ! For the price of LCD TV 's today , look to one of the major brands .. it is not worth the hassle unless you need a cheap TV .  
1	  I bought this and returned it the same day it arrived . The picture was jumpy and the color kept shifting to purple .  
2	  I bought this cd player for my grandson and one for myself . It 's got a nice sound to it , reasonably price , has a remote and is very portable . Nice looking little player .  
2	  The product works very well once set up but can be a little confusing if you are connecting to a DSL modem .  
2	  getting harder to find and my machine is not that old . Good product and really like the dye sub printers .  
1	  The item that gets all the good reviews must be a different one than the one I received today . No BOX , just a PLASTIC BAG with the unit , the remote and the power supply that you can't use . The power supply will plug fit outlets in Germany ! But will not plug into the outlets in my home in USA . I will not even open the bag . It looks like a returned unit . This is a buyer beware item . No instructions either . I get the feeling that if this unit was sold by Amazon it would be a new in the box unit , but it is sold by a different seller . This gives me even more reason to make sure that what I 'm buying is sold by Amazon !  
1	  This monitor is terrible if you have a baby that tosses and turns at night . The constant " clicking " of the the monitor on the parent unit was bad enough , but I found the baby unit " clicks " on and off , making noise in the nursery too . I was so excited to get this because it looks sleek and modern but after two nights it is going back . Also , the battery on the parent unit makes an awful noise when the battery is low ( not something you want to deal with at 3 second intervals at 2am ) . The walkie talkie is cool , but not worth keeping the unit .  
1	  I have had 2 chargers from US Wireless and both broke for no reason . Go to Ebay and find a charger for much less money .  
1	  Very complicated , not a entry level camera . You need to have prior digital photography experience to master this one . The manual is over 125 pages long ! The mini-cds , which are a major feature of the camera can't be used in a Macintosh CD drive although you still need to finalize the images to mini-disk before you can download them via USB cable to your computer . There 's only OSX support so , if you 're still using OS9 , you 're out of luck .  
2	  When I first thought about buying this mouse , I wasn't impressed by the reviews . Most of them spoke bad about it and pointed a lot of weaknesses . But I decided to buy it anyway , since I had a friend at work who had one and was very pleased with it . The one I bought came with the cradle and I must admit that it 's very useful , since you can charge the batteries when the mouse is not in use and also you can plug the receiver and keep working . The mouse is very accurate and precise , the blue led from the receiver is nice to look at and , to tell you the truth , it doesn't bother me at all or distract me , like some people said it would . My recomendation is : if you want a wireless pointing solution for your laptop , go for this one . It works fine and it 's a lot smaller than some from other brands . I paied 54.90 for the whole pack and must say that I 'm very happy with my purchase ! Great value for money ! The pack comes with : - Mouse unit - RF Receiver ( USB ) - Rechargeable batteries - Battery charger cradle - USB cable extension  
2	  I use these in an office environment for patch cables . Nothing fails more than a homemade network cable , so this fit the bill just perfectly . Easy to jack in and unjack , easy to unravel , and the category 6 to match what we have in the walls . Completely satisfied with performance .

1	  it 's about ok level , slightly below than that . it 's value should be about $ 20 ~ 25 . I 'm a serious music fan . I enjoy from Classical , Country , POP , Rock , all the way towards Death Metals . Find sony branded headphones with red tags in TJ maxx or other stores liquidation carts . THE SOUND IS CHEAP . besides , the cord is not so strong .  
2	  My daughter loves this backpack . Plenty of room for the laptop and books and tons of pockets to keep things from getting lost . Rugged construction makes it a keeper . Several of her friends have asked where she got it so they can get one too . Good Buy .  
2	  I bought the Wolverine Data FlashPac 7-in-1 Memory Card Reader to take with me on a 3 week tour of Italy . The cost was more than offset by the cost of memory cards for my camera that I did not have to buy . It really was a one button operation and the batteries lasted the entire trip without recharging . There was a charger if I needed it . I used only 3 GB of memory and downloaded over 1000 photos . It is a nice compact , efficient machine .  
1	  I bought this little device because the headphone jack on my PC case broke . I wasn't expecting 7.1 DTS quality audio for $ 3 but I WAS expecting them to get stereo right . It 's built very flimsily ( sp ? ) and feels like it 's going to break any time you plug it in or out of the computer . Okay , again , $ 3 . No soldering problems on mine . I use headphones mainly for gaming and noticed the stereo channels were reversed . On further testing , the Windows sound test produces audio in the left ear when testing the right channel and vice versa . I used the new Apple ear buds that are form fit for each ear - and yes , I tried two different pair of different style headphones . This wouldn't be a problem if you are using symmetric style headphones but makes non-symmetric ear buds virtually useless for gaming . Someone failed soldering class in China .  
1	  While the size , shape , and function of this remote is nice I have to say that it is best to stay away from it . HK has horrible support and has taken the programming software off their website and now charges for it ( $ 10 ) . Seeing how Logitech makes frequent and free updates to their software , I feel this is outrageous and warrants a poor rating . Long term you do not get the same programming and software updates as do the Harmonies . You are always behind in firmware and software and now you have to pay to upgrade . Customer Service at HK is a nightmare I had to redial a long distance number ( no 800 # ) for 30 minutes to get past constant busy signals . Once there I had to wait 40 minutes to talk to someone that just passed me to a different dept . which then passed me right back and so on and so forth until a bad transfer disconnected me . Do yourself a favor , get a different remote because if you ever have a problem HK does not stand behind their products without a fight and a charge .  
2	  I wanted to find a way to easily communicate with my grandpa , and I found this " mailbox " by Presto . At first I thought it 'd be for the younger generation of grandparents ( my grandpa 's 86 ) , but I read some reviews and found that many older grandparents liked it . When I first gave it to Grandpa , he had some reservations about it . But in the days that followed , he would tell me how much he enjoyed receiving " e-mails " from me . The best part is that I am easily able to send him pictures as well . While the photos are simply on white computer paper , they are still good enough quality that he can hang them up on his refrigerator to show his friends . Presto 's mailbox has made communicating with my grandpa so simple and quick !  
1	  I got this mouse to use about 4 hours a day when not at my docking station . It has some great features , like the on / off switch , the size ( not to big , not to small ) and the 90 degree swivel receiver . Unfortunately it has been made very cheaply and does not work about 15 % of the time you are trying to use it and about 25 % of the time it will work sporadically so lately I have been opting to use my Touchpad rather than see if it wants to work . I have had mine for about 1-2 months and have replaced 3 sets of batteries ; even with the on / off switch it drains batteries . If it would work I could put up with the battery drain but as it is I would not recommend this mouse .  
1	  purchased from walmart terrible reception . Ordered from mach speed technologies fm transmitter with remote that works great no static like the roadmaster unit . and it was cheaper with remote to boot .  
2	  i have orderer six or eight sets of these radios the cobra 3800 and have had to send only two sets back . they have given us great service . we are doing a joes creek neighbor watch and this radio does a good job we have used other brands in the past but these are the best we have used . thanks amazon . herb adamspikeville ky  
2	  This product works exactly as expected . Amazingly , nowhere in the product description is the color indicated , but by looking at the picture I was able to surmise that it 's black . The item I received is , in fact , black ! It 's described as a " Longitudinally slit , flexible plastic " . It is , in fact , flexible plastic and by golly it does have a cut going all along its length . According to the product bullet points , it 's " perfect for the keyboardist . " I am not a keyboardist , but I found it to be perfect for me too ! So I think the seller should be somewhat more general in describing who this black flexible tube would be perfect for . In all seriousness , this is a simple product and it works fine . The only problems I would expect from something like this is the plastic being too thin so as to kink when bent or the plastic chipping . It has done neither of those things to me . Comparatively , it seems priced well too ( I paid $ 12.26 for 10 feet on September 16 , 2012 . )  
2	  I took my Canon sd800 in the waterproof case WP-DC9 thru the rapids in the Grand Canyon in May of last year . The camera worked flawlessly in spite of banging around in the rapids and camping 6 nights on sand bars . It is still working flawlessly ! Jo  
1	  It has good sound ( which is why I didn't give it one star ) but it starts at max volume every time you turn it on . This is very annoying , but I 've figure out how to deal with it . I just start it on a quite song , hold it facing the floor and begin lowering the volume immediately . Not worth the money for that inconvenience and I will never buy from them again .  
2	  Feels really good on the ears . Come with the battery ( AA ) which is needed to activate the subwoofers . The cushion around the ears is very smooth and comfortable . Gread product . I compared these to my brothers drebeats headphones .. and they come pretty close . Only if these were wireless it would be perfect . I 'd definitely buy again . 5 out of 5 stars !  
1	  I have dealt with many tv tuners that may be quality hardware bundled with crappy software , which is an easy fix . This product matches such crappy software with even worse hardware . Do not buy , this is junk . I have tried several different tuner software packages to no avail . I repeat do not buy !  
1	  I bought the WDT11 and it seemed to work fine except that my computer would no longer perform a RESTART ( W2K ) after installation unless I unplugged the WPC11 from it . Linksys tech support was clueless as to the cause of the problem , and could not help except to exchange the unit . Of course the replacement did not allow a restart either . The downgrade is not necessarily for the unit so much as for the cluelessness of Linksys support . I have Dell hardware , so it 's not as if I am running rogue hardware ! I can SHUTDOWN and reboot normally , however .  
1	  I 've had my Presario for a year and a half now and I 'll provide you with my experiences .. Keyboard - I love the feel of a good crisp keyboard . I type fast and like to know that my finger has clicked on the key it aimed for . The keyboard is average . There are times that I will be typing in a word document and my cursor ends up in a totally different spot . That 's not good planning in my opinion . I don't know if it 's a glitch or poor typing , but I never have the problem on my desktop systems . Mouse Pad - It features a touch sensitive pad as is common with notebooks . This one is average . I 'm not impressed with ease of use nor accuracy and I end up plugging a cord mouse instead as the onboard one drove me nuts . I have big fingers and trying to be detailed with the sensitive tool didn't do much for me . You can set the sensitivity but it 's not very accurate . Mouse Buttons - work fine . No complaints . Weight - This laptop is on the more weightier side than many . At first , I liked that because it game me the illusion of being sturdier . However , I travel a lot and it ends up becoming a burden on my shoulder case , which is excellently padded . If you can afford lighter , do it ! Craftsmanship - I must say that I 'm disappointed with the two fold out legs in the back that elevates your laptop to allow underneath ventilation . The left side cracked after a few months . I now have to prop it up with something when using as Compaq wouldn't sell me the part to replace it with . That is bad business ! Battery - this is one place I don't have many complaints . It 's just above average battery time and I 've not had to replace mine at all . Onboard Software Bundle - Blech .. Compaq brands their name everywhere . Sure , it 's a marketing strategy that is not appreciated by me . Their tools are not fool proof and take up too much valuable space on the HD . In addition , I had to purchase the max extended RAM possible just to run at a fairly decent speed . The laptop is also partitioned into two separate virtual drives , which I do not appreciate . I had to go back and reformat that whole drive to do what I wanted to . I wish the software was non-proprietary ! I still have the laptop . I 'm considering selling it . However , after what I just wrote , who 'd want it ? It 's just below average all-around and I 'll not buy another Compaq anytime soon . Spend a few extra and get something nicer , you 'll be glad you did .  
1	  I have used Adaptec products in the past and did not expect to have problems installing the USB 2.0 2 Port Cardbus Adaptor . The instructions directed me to the Adaptec website for the Windows XP driver which I carefully followed the instructions to install on my Sony Vaio laptop . The result was a locked up computer which could only be resolved by disconnecting the battery as the keyboard and mouse no longer worked . I used System Restore to back out of the corrupted driver . I went through the installation process again and again the system crashed . I will return the product and purchase a different adaptor .  
2	  First of all I like to thank Amazon for not making me wait for my brand new toy . It arrived it seemed like as soon as I confirmed my payment ! Honestly it must have taken all of 2 days ! When I saw the box on the table I just knew it wasnt the printer because I had just placed the order not even 48 hrs earlier . But wait , there 's more . The quality pictures that this printer provides is EXCEPTIONAL ! .. They are literally postcard perfect ! You cant tell the difference . Flawless . I would recommend this to ANYONE who loves to take and print pictures its a must have ..  
1	  Mine jams every once in while . Have reset it by powering it down ( unplugging everything ) . Pain .  
1	  It is too slow to make a DVD .. It was a waste of my money ..  
1	  All I need to say is that the static it produces is too much to bare , your better off getting a cassette transmitter if your car can play tapesThis fm transmitter $ 18 - staticCassette transmitter $ 4- perfectly clear , NO static  
2	  After reading the complaints on this camera , namely , short battery life and slow response time I was a little leary on purchasing this camera . Amazon had a great price of $ 139 so I took a chance . It is truely a wonderful camera . I 've found the battery life to be acceptable . I needed to recharge after two weeks . The response time between pictures is about 5 seconds , which works fine for me . The 4x lens and image stabilization are nice features as well as the face recognition . I find the exposure is right on every time . My local OfficeMax was selling this same camera for $ 199 . Bottom line , I 'm very happy with the camera and feel I got a great value from Amazon .  
1	  I just got one of these on sale . The clock died 1 day after it was placed in the shower . The radio itself works fine . Next time I am going to try and get a digital tuner .  
2	  I have rather sweaty fingers ( I tell ya , this is really annoying ) , so it is essential for me NOT to rely on touch pad too much . This tiny mouse has been a life saver for me . It is rather affordable , and works pretty well with many ( but not all ; occasionally it doen't work on very , very smooth surfaces ) surfaces . There are more expensive chordless models , but in many occasions , I 'll be working on my notebook computer with limited amount of space , so having the " retractable " chord doesn't bother me at all . " Retractable " is indeed the key here . It 's so compact that you don't feel that you are carrying around yet another tiny electronic gadget along with your cell phone , mp3 player , shaver , etc . , etc . Anyways , highly recommended .

2	  Skip any aftermarket lens in similar zoom range and get this , sharp and contrasty , zoom is fairly good best for use with full frame cameras traveling on the light , uses your standard 77mm filter ( probably need a slim filter . ) For APS-C DX cameras , the zoom becomes a 27mm-52mm , which is pretty much a normal than a wide angle , so I 'd suggest get Nikon 10-24mm DX  
2	  I run Vista Ultimate on a home-built PC with an AMD X2 4600 + , 2GB RAM , and a 7600 GS GeForce video card . I connect to my XBOX 360 on a 100MB network and use the XBOX 's media center extender functions to watch television . I receive my TV signal over the air using a CM 4228 roof mounted antenna in the SF Bay Area . This card , with the newest drivers , is QAM capable , but only if you use the packaged TV software , and it might also be QAM compatible with other TV software suites , but not Vista Media Center . The setup using Media Center could not be easier . Install , install drivers , and add your channels . The picture is fantastic , it changes channels quickly , and does not interfere with anything else in my computer . I can't recomment this card more , and I will be buying another so I can have a dual tuner set up , allowing me to watch one channel while recording another .  
2	  I 've been using the product for three weeks and so far I 've had no radio interferrance . It 's been a worthy product so far . If you can get it for less than 60 bucks I say it 's totally worth it .  
1	  I bought this unit mainly for its voice recorder feature , very handy if I want to record myself dyuring music class . As other reviewers have already confirmed , the sound quality on playback is very good , and given that it it it has a mono built-in microphone , recorded sounds also sound good . Also useful at the expense of greater thickness , is its use of AA batteries . The bad is the user interface . The buttons are divided above and below the screen , and depending on how you hold the device , the feature you want is accessed either from the top or from the bottom . Not that accessing the feature is always intuitive , in the beginning I was forever having to re-read the manual to understand how to use it . The iPod this is not .  
2	  I read this reveiw section , and I see lots of folks that : 1 ) don't understand the resolution and aspect differences between SVGA , MPEG2 ( DVD ) , VHS and broadcast TV2 ) don't understand Microsoft operating systems ( doesn't work after UPGRADING 98 to Win2k ? What a surprise ! ) This is a great product . Works on both my XP Pro and Win2K machines , and looks great on my TV ( which I have hooked up to it ) .  
2	  This Canon Toner does the job very reliably . Doesn't streak , smudge , or leave residue . Prints many pages before running out of ink . Good quality at a fair price . We highly recommend this seller , whom we 've used before !  
2	  Well , its a well made CAT6 cables and works perfect . Arrived in great conditions .. Oh and the heads are easy to plug and unplug and their cover protects it from breakage .  
1	  I bought these earbuds in the last 2 months and one of the earbuds has already gone out . They are very cheaply made , I would not recommend buying unless you just need a fix for a few days until you can buy a reliable pair of earphones .  
2	  Does what it says . Provides a nice case to carry around my buds . No complaints .  
1	  I have had the ISqueez Cradle for maybe a couple of weeks , and the thing is already cracked in several places , rendering it pretty much useless . This comes after normal usage , in which I slid the IPod into and out of the cradle each time I entered or exited my car . I wasn't rough or anything .. I slid the IPod gently into and out of its cradle each time . ( Just imagine a new video IPod being handled roughly ? Can't do it ? Good , then you believe me when I tell you I was most careful and gentle about placing the IPod in the cradle .. ) Now , the cradle is pretty much useless . The top part of it has cracked into three pieces , leaving " flaps " of squeezy foam rubber hanging off of the bottom part . The IPod no longer is firmly cradled because of these loose pieces . If the materials were more sturdy , this would be a great product . But given how flimsy it has turned out to be after just a couple of weeks of normal usage , I would recommend you spend a few more bucks for something a little more durable , and of a higher quality .  
2	  .. a review from the disposable " made in china " point of view .. aka realityOrdered a pair and when they arrived one speaker sounded crappy . Price was right and I was altray invested in these ( mounted them in my Catalina 25 sailboat .. didn't really want to drill another set of holes to mount a different set ) so I sucked it up and ordered another pair .. Fast Forward .. I 've been using them for 2 years now , I now have a spare speaker in case one more fails ( still in them for under $ 50 ) , and honestly the Piaudio quality is REALLY good . I 'm no pro , but I like to crank my Foo , Dave Matthews , Jimmy , and Red Hot Chili 's when I sail and these sound almost as good as the BOSE 151 's I had on my Pearson 26 . I do recommend them but I 'd be prepared for the shock of a possible DOA and pony up for another set .. you 'll have spare .. and you don't have to hassle with returns ;) Still 4 stars in my book for the good sound quality at a fraction of the cost .. they are what they are . Here we are .. almost 2013 , these speakers are still sounding awesome on my catalina 25 . Just bumped my mark to 5 stars . Get some now :)  
2	  Wow ! What a VD gift for myself . The HK 3480 matched to Polk speakers . The receiver is plenty powerful enough for smaller listening environments . Multi-inputs and outputs ( yes , one can bi-wire the speakers ) , minimalist front panel features . Remote is ok , not backlit or glow in the dark . I think I 'm going to love the VMax feature . Have tried it on Mannheim Steamroller - " Classical Gas " , Queen Latifah - " Dana Owens Album " really has depth from the crystal clear highs , deep , non-rumbling lows and her voice and the brass-wonderful ! Have tried it with Linda Ronstadt 's " Cry Like a Rainstorm , Howl Like the Wind " , Nina Simone 's " The Blues " sounded like I was in the studio with her . Triple-level lights and panel are appreciated when one doesn't want a big glowing machine in an otherwise darkened room . I 'm looking forward to trying this with a Deadwood DVD or maybe dig out the Matrix . My listening expectations are rising by the minute .  
2	  Great Camera . Love the Cd type Media and it has a great deal of special features . Just don't leave it in a cab in Boston like us dopes . I recomend the Mavica  
1	  I have been burning DVDs for years . I would always read reviews discussing issues with blank media . I have used numerous brands over the years and never had any trouble . I always assumed people had poor hardware or did not know what they were doing . I was wrong . Bad blanks do exist and Verbatim makes them . I would say about 50 or the 100 discs in the spindle were completely useless and did not burn . This is my first time using Verbatim and it will be my last . Buy this at your own huge risk .  
2	  Why in the world would a person pay $ 30-$150 for an HDMI cable at any retail store ? The more cutting question is how those retailers can sleep at night charging those kind of prices . Its digital , not analog . It either works or it doesn't . These cables work . Seem sturdy . Enough said .  
1	  I 've had these for 4 months and have enjoyed them until now . The wires are broken / loose and not working . There is another review with a similar problem at 4.5 months . Not a long lasting product , even with gentle usage .  
2	  Great product as always . Works perfectly with my seven-year-old S9000 . The only problem is that most retail stores like Office Depot sell them for $ 75 + . So I 'm happy to see that Amazon has them for only $ 54 ..  
2	  These headphones have good quality sound . I use them for jogging and there 's not too much to complain about there . They stay on well enough . My only complaint is that the band that goes behind the neck is not adjustable . Not a big deal in terms of function , but the band sticks out a bit in the back and looks a little goofy . All around pleased with the product , and would recommend it .  
1	  Didn't work with MTP AV and Mac OSX . 6 . Motu said it wouldn't either . I wasted my time and money . Might be a great buy for someone who has an older operating system . bah !  
1	  I ordered the Monster THXV100F8WHT but instead received an inferior cable the Monster SV100F-8 WHT . I already had opened the package before realizing I had the wrong cable in hand . Gathering from what I read about Amazon 's return policy I could no longer return it due to already opening the package , however upon contacting them , Amazon refunded my purchase and issued a return label . So I am happy to report Amazon did their best to make things right . Hopefully anyone else ordering the THXV100F8WHT will get what they paid for . The cable I got appears to be Monsters bottom of the line .  
1	  I have been using Verbatim Lightscribe disk for about a year with no problems at all . Unfortunatly that is not the case with this batch . Every disk fails when burning to them unless I burn at 4X speed or slower . When at 4X I only had about a 50 % fail rate . I had purchased a total of 60 disk and had over 40 fail .  
1	  I bought 2 of these units for mothers day .. NEITHER one of them work . COBY basically told me that the only recourse I had was to return them . that the software was not formatted properly on the units . I can't believe that both of them were the same . so , I decided to return them to amazon for a refund .. I am not going to risk trying this again . thank God amazon has a great return policy !  
2	  If you are in any way active in your photography , this is an absolute must-have ! I bought the Gepe Mini on e-bay . They were being sold in the U.K. for $ 7.95 so I bought two for a total of $ 23.00 . I wish I had bought more ! This is small , light , completely tight and safe for your SD cards . I live on the edge of the Great Basin , so moisture is not a problem , but dust is . This holds the cards in complete safety . Putting a lanyard through the eyelet lets me slip it into my pocket , and it is so light that I don't even know it 's there . I like to hike around the hills to find images and am beginning to get weddings and portraits to shoot . I use small ( 2-4 MB ) cards , so it is invaluable to have extras close by without having to instantly edit a full card or run back to the car for more . Overall I would encourage anyone get one of these little gems !  
2	  This DVD player works just fine after 4 years of owning and using quite a bit . My 4 year old spilled water on it , after drying out , it still works . I bought a new portable DVD player for a Christmas gift , not this brand , it doens't work after 2 uses . So , yeah , I would recommned this DVD player .  
2	  I just bought these speakers to replace a 2.1 THX system from cambridge soundworks that I purchased about a year and half ago . That set has never really impressed me ( just ordinary sound quality ) so I started some research and thankfully found this set . It is more than I wanted to spend ( 222 $ from another reliable on-line retailer ) , however I agree w / others .. it is worth the money ( high-end quality / a lot of features ) .. and it does list for 400 $ . PC World recently reviewed 5.1 speakers and this one was ranked first and also considered a " best buy " @ 400 $ . This set has received awesome ( nearly perfect across the board ) reviews everywhere I looked , that should tell you something . Also , I own logitech keyboard / mouse and I have been very satisfied w / their products so far . Now I just have to buy some speaker stands for the rear channels and I 'm golden . I live in an apartment and I 'm sure the neighbors will love the powered 10 " sub :) Yes , I know it 's big-it 's not a 6.5 or 8 " sub , people . You gotta expect it to be big / heavy . This is the quintessential 5.1 PC system in my opinion , at least until 6.1 & 7.1 start taking over and / or if Logitech figures ways to improve upon this set . In closing , you simply can not find a better / higher rated 5.1 system in this price range . Highly recommended .  
2	  great price - works like it should , I use it to connect my acer netbook to an lcd flat screen - works good  
1	  I have a Oregon Scientific 120 and a 121 model , both are lacking in headphone department . They won't stay in while swimming . I tried the Freestyle audio and their head phones get wet and stop working . The only MP3 player that works like it 's suppose to is the product by " Swimman " where they waterproof a Ipod shuffle from the inside , pared with their waterproof headphones that are like using bose ear buds under water this unit is a dream and highly recommended !  
1	  This unit is ok except when you try to do anything extra , like hook up the remote control via rs232 . I wasted a day on that one , as far as I can tell , this function simply does not work . I have a breakout box , understand the voltages , and know how to program - and I have a port monitor showing me I 'm outputing what I want to output . I can see the data going out , can do a break which is easy to see on the breakout box , and still this unit refuses to do anything using this interface . And it tells you nothing , so you can't figure out what 's wrong . Also , the power supply , 19v 2 amps burned out after about 1 year and was not easy to find a replacement . And of all things , I had a 250 gig drive but the connector in this unit is too wide , by what looks like about a 1/64th of an inch . So , I couldn't hook up my maxtor 250 drive . My maxtor 120 would hook up . I have ordered a short extension cable to see if that will fit . The manual is written by someone who does not speak English . I am about to try customer support , but they 're on east coast time so I will have to get up early tomorrow . Overall , it 's not bad if you paid only about $ 200 and are good with installing hardrives . The quality of the recordings is less than I 'd hoped . To get decent resolution , you need to specify multiplex , but then you only get 7.5 frames / sec data rate . And finally , when one camera triggers while another is still triggered ( on motion detect ) it is supposed to continue recording for the full time of the second camera , but it doesn't , so you can lose important video . I wouldn't buy this a second time .  
1	  2 hrs w / tech support & they say the unit is bad - return it . so I am returning it and have ordered the Hawking HWREN1 Hi-Gain Wireless-300N Range Extender .  
1	  There seems to be a disconnect in the Blue Microphone company between the accessories and the actual microphone . Not sure how you can claim this is a Universal Pop Filter when there is no way to get it to work on the Yeti without drilling a hole or ( like I did ) using a twist tie for a seriously poor looking end result . What makes it worse is the company 's " Deal with it " attitude-like it 's cool to be creative . Well , not for me at $ 30 + bucks . Buy something with a clip and buy it cheaper .  
2	  It 's kid-proof . That says something . Does exactly what it 's supposed to do for the hard-to-find iPod Generation 2 Shuffle external speaker ..  
2	  Works great ! And the price is great . $ 20.00 less than Target ! . I have had no problem where ever I drive ! Nothing to set up , just plug in and go .  
1	  The fluid that was supposed to fix the CD came in a hard block all dried out . My guess is that someone got their hands on some cases of really old product and decided to sell them .  
2	  I used these on a computer case that was small and upgraded the video card which generated a little more heat . I put this next to my video card and now my system runs a lot cooler .  
1	  I bought one of the first one of these - and returned it . It 's almost a great book reader , and with the sci-fi e-books at ( .. ) I was looking forward to one of these , however the screen is just too reflective . It 's hard to make out the words , and the backlighting is not near as good as on my palm . I liked it because of its screen size meant that it was a better choice for e-books than a traditional pda . I thought that it worked pretty well for its intended purpose . But in the end , the screen was just too hard to read under varying light conditions . If this is fixed , I 'd be happy to go back to it . I would pay more for the same unit with an upgraded screen with good backlighting .  
1	  For some unkown reason this Adata flash drive broke in 2 weeks on me . This thing is garbage , there a plenty of flash drives out there , I suggest you find a more durable one .  
1	  I bought one of these for my son and to date it has not worked at all . Keeps freezing up . Battery wont charge . Basically its a waste of money . I sent mine back for a refund and wentto Best Buy and bought a Dynex for 150 bucks , a little more than I wanted to spend but it worked right out of the box which right away was na improvement , plus my son can use it easily . Do not buy this item , it is only a headache  
2	  I bought this ball head in conjunction with my 055XPROB tripod and they funtion flawlessly together . Great solid construction , and easy to use . The only thing that took a little white to get used to was shooting with my camera off tripod and having the large tripod shoe attached . It is very thin but still feels a little funny while hand-holding the camera , it can easily be removed with a quarter . This is also not very light , but either is the D300 I use it with , makes for a very solid set up .  
1	  I purchased this battery after triple checking that it was for my computer model . It wasn't and I was stuck with paying to have it replaced . It is better to eat the higher price and go through the vendor ( Toshiba 's ) website . It will save you money and aggravation in the end .  
2	  This item works great and allows the use of legacy keyboards / mice with usb ports .  
1	  This USB serial port sucks . That would be zero stars if I could . It works OK for a while , but - for example - after a few hundred blocks of 1063 ASCII characters , it starts delivering bytes out of order ! The only XP driver I can find for this , from [ .. ] , DriverGuide , aten - [ .. ] , or anyGooglewhere , is the ATEN USB to Serial Bridge , version 2.0.0.18 , dated 2003 . ( Debugged by disconnecting block-ASCII source , attaching PC Hyperterminal , typed in ' x ' , ' x ' , ' y ' , delivered ' L ' , ' M ' , ' N ' - previous characters from now-disconnected source ! Isolated to the adapter by swapping my block-ASCII source cord to the other , " real " COM1 , got hours of flawless I / O. ) What a way to waste a day debugging cables , peripherals , VB . net code , etc . , when the interface was the culprit all along ! I 'm going to try try KeySpan next ; wish me luck .  
2	  it helps keep my phone around my neck so that it doesnt fall to the floor . also helps me find it when its hiding in my purse . great purchase and super sturdy . i use the htc evo 3d phone . works nicely  
1	  I bought this thinking I 'd save [ some money ] compared to the Stowaway . What a mistake ! I eventually gave this away and bought the Stowaway and the difference is like day and night . ( Shows buying cheap costs more in the long run ) . The GoType keys are not the high quality keys found on the Stowaway , which are just like my IBM Thinkpad . They are small ( spcing between keys vertically is really small ) and they rock , and as a fast typist I get occasional errors . It seems sometimes that the keys do not register if I press off center on them , which happens when you type fast . The small size of the Stowaway allows me to carry it everywhere , while I found I left the GoType in the office . So I end up using it so much more . ..  
2	  This is the best Cannon that I have ever bought - high praise in that I 've had five Canons since my AE1 in the 1970s . First off , THE FLASH DELAY IS MINIMAL ! No more blurred pictures of 7 year olds power-opening Christmas presents faster than the flash . I must admit that I had buyer 's remorse when I saw the SD630 and its 3 " screen for only $ 50 more . However , that camera does not have a MANUAL VIEW FINDER . To me this is an essential function if you ever damage the LCD screen as I did in the middle of a scenic trip to New Zealand .  
1	  It doesn't sound as solid as the stocked earbuds that came with my Zen Vision M 30GB ( I did a review of this player ) . I got it and plug it in , as soon as I did , I can hear static sounds as I push it into my Zen . I had a feeling it wasn't going to sound good . I ordered it a month ago and wonder why it didn't ship until I sent an email to amazon and they explained why and had it in two days . The pouch it comes in says Creative Zen Micro . This is the EP-480 for the Micro . Not the EP-480 for the Zen Vision M ( Which would make me think the EP-480 has an upgraded sound board or whatever in it for the ZVM.I 'm looking to order another set of headphone because this isn't doing it for me . It sounds ' ok ' . It will do for awhile . Update 4/29/07These earbuds don't have much bass . The stocked ones did . I used to be able to listen to my music pretty loud and have it sound great , but with these , It jusy sounds like crap in my ears . The only good thins about this is , it sounds ok when listening very low .  
1	  As others have mentioned , this keyboard is excellent in all ways but one - the spacebar . The keys themsleves have a great tactile feel and are very quiet - exaclty what I was looking for . However , the spacebar is massive ( and not split in two as it should have been ) , with the actuator right in the middle . Unfortunately , when your hands are in the natural position your thumbs are at the far left and right of the spacebar . Not only do you have to push pretty hard to get it to go down , it also makes a REALLY LOUD clicking noise because you 're actually forcing the actuator down at an angle . If they redesign this with a split spacebar I would LOVE it !  
1	  I tried to get off cheap with an HDMI cable but I got what I paid for . Picture kept breaking up ( I even switched for one cord to the other to make sure I didn't have a bad jack . ) pixelated my screen , sound was full of static , even lost picture completely several times .  
1	  I hope I save somebody the time and trouble of buying this piece of garbage . As some of the other reviewers have experienced , mine starting acting up after three months . I was told by the manufacturer that for $ 80 I should send it back for a " reconditioned " one . Went to Mail Boxes Etc .. and sent it back . I received the " new " one about three weeks later and I am having the same problem with this one . The kicker of this whole mess was the woman at Mail Boxes Etc .. told me that sometimes the same people send the machine back three to four times ! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS !  
1	  Got this thing all hooked up and nothing . Not a buzz , pop or even a flatline . Power to device-check . Press power button-check . Houston we have a problem .  
1	  i bought 3 fuji waterproof cameras last year for a cruise . i took 2 cameras and used them outside on a tubing excursion and 4 pics half came out ( they were still fuzzy ) I thought it was the place i took the cameras to be developed since people didnt seem to be too knowledgable . so this year i went to a waterpark with my son and took last camera ( went to a different place to develop them ) and none of the pictures came out . so now i have no pics of two vacations-to make matters worse i have contacted fuji several times via e mail and i havent even recieved a response-so i will never buy another fuji product-i want pics of my vacation next time  
2	  Ordered this camera because it seemed like an amazing deal , for the kit with the lens and the dateback body . Package arrived , it 's the standard body in the kit . Be aware of false advertising / very expensive typo ..  
1	  i bought this router and a netgear wireless PCMCIA card . could not get the router to work properly with my motorola surfboard cable modem . spent 2 days on phone with netgear tech support ( in india , difficult to understand them ) gave up . bought linksys . plugged it in and it worked . no configuration . linksys interface is slightly better . still no idea on why the netgear router gave me so much trouble . bottom line : linksys-up and running as soon as i plugged it innetgear-2 days and i gave up , tech support no help  
1	  I have three 580EXII flashes . All three of them have had their external power supply port break and drop into the flash body . This makes the flash almost useless to me because I bounce light for fill on most of my jobs and I need to have the extra power for speed and flash power consistency . I have sent all three flashes back into Canon and paid about $ 180 a piece to have them repaired . At first I thought I was being to hard on the flash when plugging the power supply in . However , now I have been extremely careful when plugging them in , and I have one of my three flashes that has to go back in to Canon for repair . This will be the second time it has been in to Canon in a very short time . If they repaired it correctly ( restoring it to factory quality ) and it broke this easily again , that is a huge problem for me . I now am looking to switch to the Quantum system because I have had so many problems with Canon 's flash systems . On a side note - I could write a short story on their horrible flash consistency . I am constantly having to manage them to keep my results consistent . Even using the the flashes built in light meter ( This method does get me the most consistent results though ) . I wish Canon would dump a ton of time into their flash technology because I have been stuck with flash systems for several years that are getting smoked by Nikon 's flash consistency . ( ( If you do not need to run these flashes with the external power supply , then I would give the construction quality a 5 ) ) .  
2	  If you are looking for a reliable network printer with a fair amount of features for a small office this is it . We currently have 8-10 people that use this printer daily yet we never had we had a problem with it . I added the duplex tray for some heavy duty print jobs . It went in flawlessly and worked perfect . If your doing heavy volume printing you might want something a little more zippy but if your doing your average office workload this is perfect . Did I mention it supports internet printing . So print to it from home .  
2	  I really love what this lens can do . It 's great for baby pictures . I wish it had auto focus . I don't always detect blurriness until I get it onto the computer . I make sure to capture a lot of pictures just in case .  
2	  As far as sound goes , these buds are awesome . Listening to people talk is like having them right next to me . When listening to music , the bass really comes out . The fake-leather carrying case and added accessory baglet is also nice to have while storing or transporting these buds . But the buds hurt my ears . After two hours I have to remove them to give my ears a rest . The cord is also a foot too short and too thin , so using these on anything other than a closely-held iPod or MP3 player is out of the question because the cord is thin and likely to rip apart should the user wear these while doing physical exercise . The thin cord also easily gets tangled in itself . So .. if you are a cautious user , don't wear buds while working or doing physical exercise , these buds are awesome for their audio performance . But are they worth the current price of almost USD 100 ?  
1	  I bought the chill mat when it was on sale .. and yet I still don't feel like I got a deal . The mat IS very loud , but that was of less concern to me than the fact that the USB connector is extremely un-sturdy and became damaged quickly , necessitating the connector to be held down to make the mat work . One handed computing is not my preferred method . Despite these defects , the mat gets the job done , keeping my chronically over heating laptop cool , but I came on Amazon to look for a replacement and ended up leaving this review .  
1	  The VCR does not have good recording quality and when you press the " stop " button , it does not stop right away - you must click several times . The dvd player is okay . Remote is not very easy to use . Very disappointed in the product . I have a Panasonic VCR since 1990 . The recording quality is still excellent and the remote is very easy to use . There is no comparison between the Samsung and the Panasonic .  
1	  Save yourself $ 10 and buy a jar of mayonnaise , you 'll get the same results smearing that all over your screen . Guess I shouldn't be surprised buying a product from a company known for selling ( scamming ) overpriced " premium " audio cables . A one star review is the lowest you can give . It 's also generous for this product .  
1	  For $ 500 ( or $ 600 for the 60GB edition ) you can get a computer . I think its a little to expensive for what you get . The battery life is better , which is a plus but other than that there is no significant improvement on the 4G iPod , except for the color screen / photo viewing which in my opinion is not worth 100 extra dollars . There are much better color screen and photo viewing mp3 player alternatives out there , at a much lower cost . Check out the Archos Gmini 400 ( can play videos also and its the same size as the iPod ) , iRiver iHP-320 ( bundled with FM Radio , In-line recording , voice recording ) , or Cowon iAudio M5 ( same as iRiver IHP-320 only smaller ) . [ .. ]  
2	  I watch tv over my computer screen . Also just upgraded to 32 " . Had been very happy with the Bose Companion speakers that were damaged in moving . This set has the seperate woofer . The sound is even more sharper , crisper and cleaner ! The base is a mixed blessing . It is fantastic most of the time - the sound is MORE life - like . But it is prone it shape " pops " and " thuds " for little things . ie - someone thumps a book . A loud , sharp thud is produced , out of proporation with the action . In action scenes , the sound could not be better . It just is TOO sensitive . There should be a way to moderate the bass .  
1	  Where oh where to start ? I 'll list the good things first , because honestly , the list is shorter . - The screen quality is great-A number of useful programs come factory installedAnd , that 's about it . Now , for the bad : - The Motherboard crashed irrepairably and needed to be replaced after just over a year . - The memory installed was neither enough , nor was long lasting , as it also had to be replaced . - Several keys on the keyboard ( including backspace , all arrow keys and the shift keys ) have broken just beyond the time of the one year warranty . - The Left mouse key also has broken-The speakers fade in and out at will and crackle upon changing the volume . If you turn it up one speaker will kill completely . - The system shuts down / freezes at random intervals-Over time , the battery life will continue to shorten . After one year , disconnecting the battery charger ( which also had to be replaced ! ) will give you a battery life of about 3 minutes . Shall I go on ? There are more replaced parts on my comupter than factory ones ! Both a sibling and myself got the same computer and experienced NUMEROUS serious problems . Never before have I had so much trouble with a computer ! I suggest you RUN AWAY and never look back . I personally spent more FIXING this computer than I did on purchasing it . I wish I could give it negative stars !  
1	  Bought this in 2006 and it was the biggest mistake . April 2008 it started acting up , wont turn on . Called the company they thought it was the remote . $ 75 later , it 's still not working . Had a cable tv rep . out and turns out it was the tv not the remote . So I 'm out $ 700 for the biggest piece of junk I 've ever owned .  
1	  I bought a 5 GB RIO Carbon about 2 years ago . After one year the volume knob broke , so I returned it , paid $ 100 and got a replacement . About 2 months later the replacement died , so I paid another $ 100 and got another replacement . Now the third replacement volume knob broke ( without any dropping etc . ) I wish I never bought a RIO . It has a serious design flaw . Buy an MP3 player with no moving parts . I should have bought an Ipod , as I have now spent far too much money continuously repairing / replacing my RIO . Also not there is no shuffle mode on it either which would have been a nice feature .  
2	  It is a very capable little tv . It works with PS2 , DVD Player , Audio hook up and you can use it in the car !  
1	  Placed the order and was expected to receive within a week . But did not receive the product of weeks . Contacted the customer care , thanks to A to Z claim of Amazon which helped me to get my money back . This sucks on the part of clearav , will be thinking twice before placeing placing order with this vendor .  
1	  I bought my first one used from Amazon back in July and within 2 weeks , the screen died . I ordered another one , only to have the firmware corrupt and whenever I tried to reload the firmware , the player would disconnect from my PC . At first it seemed nice . It had decent sound and a good size of screen , but for all the trouble , it 's not worth the money . Creative doesn't give a long enough warranty . I have a Creative sound card and sound system for my PC which have been wonderful , and my brothers each have a Vision M which has no problems , so I 'm disappointed in the quality . And why is it $ 300 now ? It was only $ 80 when I bought the first two this past summer . There 's no way it 's worth $ 300 , let alone , $ 80 .  
2	  I bought these headphones for my three-year old son during long car rides . He enjoys using them , and they seem to be comfortable . The ear cup is not quite large enough to entirely surround his ears , but it fits over the top and rests on the lobes . The padding is good so I don't think this will be a problem . He has worn them for several hours without complaining , and even fell asleep in his car seat wearing them . The band is very adjustable ( even I can wear these ) but they still fit him snugly . A volume limiting attachment was shipped with the headphones , and works . Although , when using the limiter the device volume has to be turned up very high to be audible . I think the cushion on the ear cup helps reduce road noise , etc . I would like to see sturdier cord , especially where it connects to the ear cups , but it has not been a problem yet .  
2	  These are pretty good earphones . They fit comfortably and sound good . I am using them as a secondary set of earphones for my iPod and they fulfill that job nicely .  
1	  Though I haven't had the leaking issues that some folks have , I would have to whole-heartedly agree that this machine is outrageously loud when on the high setting . Fortunately , the medium is fine for my smallish bedroom . BUT the problem I have is with the light ! Nowhere on the box did I see mention of the horrible , massive , green glowing light . As someone who needs it pitch black to sleep at night , this thing is like putting a giant beacon in the middle of the room . And despite my best efforts at covering the light without covering the vents , it 's impossible to drown it out completely . OH . AND the gurgling . Almost forgot - it periodically gurgles - loudly - while it 's on . Tends to wake one up on and off all night long . If I didn't need a humidifier so badly for my asthma this week during allergy season , I 'd have taken this unit back where I bought it immediately . Unfortunately , I 've been hard-pressed to find one .  
2	  I love this device . It gives me all the functionality I need & more . I only have one major complaint : It comes with a cover that does not give you access to any of the function keys , so every time you want to do something you have to take it out of the cover . They do sell a cover with access to all the ports & function keys , but they want another $ 29 for that . Why not give you that instead of this cover ?  
2	  I bought this drive to use as additional AV Storage . It has been working great as offline storage for my ReplayTV unit and also is fast enough to serve up videos directly to ReplayTV . In addition I use it for digital photos and music and have not had any problems with it . I did reformat the drive to NTFS prior to transfering the data and I am using the USB2 connection instead of the firewire but I like the fact that is has both connections available . Overall a great product for an external drive . But like all external drives data transfer speed is limited by the USB2 or firewire interface speed .  
1	  My HP laptop got very hot while sitting on my lap . I had to put it on a small board to keep from burning my legs . The computer would get so hot after prolonged use it would shut down ! I purchased the Notepal Cooler and what a difference . The temperature of the laptop without Notepal would reach 151F . With Notepal , the laptop now stays in the 127F-133F range with no more shutdowns . The two fans on the Cooler are very quiet . You won't even know they 're running ! If you have a 17 " laptop you might want to get the new Cooler Master NotePal W1 Notebook Cooler ( R9-NBC-AWAK about $ 45 ) . The widescreen laptop fits perfectly .  
2	  I picked up this card for my Garmin Ique 3600 GPS / PDA as I was told a fast speed card would help . I 'm no expert , but I haven't experienced and problems with the card . It is reliable and speedy .  
2	  I 'm just getting into back photography after 25 years . I received this as a gift and was overwhelmed at first . But in no time I was having a ball with this and how easy it was to use . Love the lens !  
2	  works very well  
1	  This did not work in the 5-6 ipods i tried . the one it did , it had lots of static and did not function very well .  
1	  This cable only looks like a dual link , in fact it is only single link , it does not work with a monitor at 2560x1440  
1	  This is nothing more than a very small piece of cotton cloth that is over-priced . The size and usefulness is such that I would only expect to see these as give-aways at a trade show or something . What a joke - there are much better values to be found on Amazon such as the Nikon Micro Fiber cleaning cloth that fits into its ' own pouch . I wish I had found it before I purchased this piece of worthless scrap .  
2	  I bought this for a trip to Alaska . It easily held all of our camera equipment - extra camera , extra lens , etc . It 's very easy to get into to remove equipment as needed . The attached rain jacket was very helpful as it rained every day we were there , so I didn't have to worry about the equipment getting wet . We saw another person with the smaller version and he said it was the best bag he 'd ever had , also .  
2	  I 'm not an audiophile , but after a lot of research , I bought this system . For a little more money than most HTIBs you get a lot more sound . This system can rattle my house and also plays the subtle sounds you expect from a good surround system . The room I set up my system in is 20x30 , and I needed new speaker wires . If you use it in a big room , you 'll need longer wire .  
1	  I would not purchase this product . It was a gift that sadly cost over $ 50 and is not worth the sale price of $ 20 . I could not get the product to play my ipod nano most of the time or my iphone . I would unplug and restart then try again . Sometimes it would work but most the time not . Also I could not charge my nano and play it on the speakers which is a big one for me as it was drained within 2 hours . It looks pretty but that 's about it in my opinion .  
2	  Wow , this is one slick little gadget ! So far it works great , but I can see the battery getting a little weak like some of the other reviewers have described . I normally don't purchase the extended warranty , but I did with this item . With the Apple protection plan they don't just repair the product , they replace it . So I will wait for about two years until enough people complain to Apple , and they manufacture a better battery . Also the Itunes store is pretty good , but they are missing some very popular artists . ( try searching for Dave Matthews Band . I mean they don't have any Dave Matthews ? Get with it ! ) As far as the FM transmitter goes I have tried three of them and finally settled on the Monster brand one . I would stay away from the one that Best Buy sells for $ 99.99 . I can't remember the name of it but it is a white cradle that has all of these extentions to plug into the ciggarette lighter . Just by taking it out of the package ( thats right folks 100 bucks and they sell it in one of those imposible to open plastic packages ! ) I knew that it would break soon , and I was right ! Plus any bump in the road and my Ipod would get jarred out of position . Very angry with this product ! Enough about the accesories , buy an Ipod Mini today ! You will not regret it .  
1	  Overall the AT & T ; 1738 answering machine has good functional qualities . However , the prompt voice is a little insulting in that it talks to you like you have never touched a piece of electronics in your life and will never understand the technology . As for the voice quality , I was going to replace my 15 + year old Code-A-Phone tape-based machine with my new AT & T ; machine until I heard the announce voice quality from the new device . It sounded as if you were trying to talk through a pillow ! Needless to say , my old Code-A-Phone machine will be seeing a lot more service until I can find a solid-state machine with voice quality worthy of my use . For some reason , the transition from the earlier Lucent machines ( I also have a Lucent A560 with excellent voice quality ) to the more recent AT & T ; machines has caused a degadation in the voice quality . It probably has something to do with profits .  
2	  I bought this for my 5G iPod video , and it works great . They must have redesigned the cut-out for the headphones because mine is cut out to the right .. exactly where it 's supposed to be . I can fit headphones , iTalk , and dock connector in the pouch , and with the iPod inside , it stills closes well . I have my iPod in the leather case , and it is great . It doesn't get 5 stars because the plastic protector sheet for the face is too thick . The thickness affected the touch sensitivity . I bought the thinner protector sheets that Apple offers , and it works much better ! The case fits great in my backpack , or purse , and I have had no problems with damage . It may be a bit too bulky for some people , but I love this thing , and it comes with almost everything you would need to protect your iPod . I would recommend this .  
2	  So far I am very happy with the printer . The prints look like they were done at a professional lab . The only thing I wish is that I could buy the ink and the paper separately .  
1	  My iPod 40GB died within TWO MONTHS of its initial use as Christmas present . The hard drive quit working and just makes little clicking sounds . My husband 's 20GB iPod died within SIX months of purchase . His locks up his computer and won't hold files or play music . He has been sent to " email support " but reformatting the hard drive and reinstalling the operating system hasn't helped , so we don't expect much good from that . Our father in law went through 3 iPods within a year . Similar issues . These are lovely and useful devices , but TERRIBLE PRODUCT RELIABILITY . None of us used the product while jogging or doing anything else strenuous to the devices . Two of these iPods were refurbished by HP . That was a terrible product support experience , too . A tech industry insider suggested that we replace our iPods with the disposable Shuffle - not much functionality , but at least it 's just $ 100 down the drain every year or so - rather than $ 200 to $ 500 ! We 'll also look into the extended warranty .. unless we switch away from Apple entirely and re-scan our entire music inventory . ( Another recommendation : don't use the Apple proprietary music format in case you experience what we did and don't want to give Apple a second chance afterward . Buyer beware . These are disposable devices . Handle like glass and don't expect them to last .  
1	  I thought my unit was broken when I firsthooked it up , because switched to VCR it stillshowed the " blue greeter " screen for DVD . Iheard somebody else had this experience withthe S-Video , so I tried Composite Video ( yellow RCA ) - same story . Only when Ihooked up the RF-out jack ( yuck ! ) could Isee the VCR video . Oddly , I could hearthe audio on Line-Out , I just couldn't useeither of the Video jacks for Line-Out . Ithought my unit might be broken , so Icalled their customer support . After hanging up on me several times , theyeventually said you can only view the VCRon RF-out . Since I have Tivo , I don't needto hook up my Cable to the VCR - I just wantto watch tapes . So my cable is alreadyhooked up to my TV / Tivo . I could hook upthe RF-out to a 2nd RF-in on my TV , but whowants to switch back and forth betweenRF-in jacks on my TV , and maybe leave itin the wrong state and mess up a Tivorecording ? Time to send it back . Note theUser manual mentions nothing of this . Itmakes it sound like S-Video should work foreverything . I 'm still not certain my unit isn't simply broken ormisconfigured . Why would Line Out switch the Audioif it can't supply the video ? But their Tech Support won't listen or help , and tells me thisis how it 's supposed to work . Sheesh . If somebody has a different experience , please share it , becauseif it actually * worked * I 'd give this unit 5 stars .  
2	  It is a bit pricey , however I have found over the years that sometimes paying a few buck more for something is well worth the agrivation . I remember spending hours trying to get a similar low cost unit to fit my Nikon F-2 for the same purpose , and it never did work very well . My use for this little gem is for work with ' astrophotography ' and I have to reley on repeatability and very low light situations to focus . Although I have not tested it against other similar , less expensive units like the Seagull or Photodiox Pro-1 , I can say the Nikon DR-6 seems to give me eactly what I wanted . It fits very well on my D300 and the 2x feature is a very big plus .  
2	  I bought this unique little item because I was always finding myself without my Ipod whenever I needed it . It is a great and sturdy item , not too big to actually put on my key chain , and the bottle opener was a nice addition . It even looks sleek and stylish , and is a great conversation piece as well . The only flaw I found is not so much a flaw , but a comment , or suggestion . I now always have my Ipod on me , but I am always forgetting my earbuds . Sure it shows a place to wind your earbuds around the item , but they do not travel well like this , and their bulky on the unit , and they are always coming loose or falling off . Plus aftermarket earbuds don't fit well at all . Overall I think this is a great item , and a great accessory to my Ipod Shuffle .  
2	  I happen to get Nikon SB600 used flash recently , Nikon discounted this model . This amazing little flash , I use it with diffuser or minisoft box for direct shots . Pros : 90 degree vertical bounce , 180 degree horizontal bounce . Nikon TTL auto mdoe identify zoom used by you and adjusts the light accordingly . Can also be used in manual mode . Light weight compared to Nikon sb900 / sb700 and less costly than them . Better light than sb400 , I do not have sb700 ( Also great flash ) , online reviews says , sb600 and sb700 has almost same light power ( guide number ) . Can be used as slave flash . NikonD7000 has in built master flash . I have used sb600 as remote flash with out any cables , it works great . In order to use sb600 as slave with Nikon D7000 , you should use built flash also , however you have option to avoid the built in flash light , it uses very minimum light needed to fire the sb600 . Built in master flash feature may or may not available for all nikon models , check out user guide . It 's good step up from sb400 flash , Light varies based on zoom with ttl mode . Can be used for continues shots , less lag between shots . Uses 4 AA batteries . Conbigger flash for entry level dslr users , check out sb400Discontinued model , check out sb700 , little bigger than this . How to use NikonD7000 in built flash as master flash and sb600 as slave flash ? = Go to custom setting menu ( pencil picture ) ->e Bracketing / flash->e3 Falsh cntrl for built in flash -> Commander mode . Inside commander mode , go to built-in flash , set mode as " - " ( This setting will fire built flash with minimum light needed for sb600 to fire ) . If would like to fire built in flash also , leave the Built-in flash setting as TTL . go to group A , set the mode to TTL . you can also choose group B. let 's say we are using group A.Go to channel set it to either 1 or 2 or 3 , press ok , note down what you number you used for channel . Let 's say 3 . Switch on sb600 , make sure it is in TTL mode , if not press mode button , until it display TTLHold on zoom and minus button for few seconds , it will show remote symbol , with OFF setting , press the mode button to switch on remote mode to ON setting . Press on button , it will show remote symbol , channel number and group name . Make sure group A and channel 3 set ( or you choice of selection used on camera settings ) . If not , use mode and plus or minus buttons to set them to group name and channel number as set in NikonD7000 . You are all set to use sb600 as slave on NikonD7000 in built flash . Note : Since sb600 fire based on light from nikon d7000 , sb600 should be in position to receive light from camera built in flash . It may not work behind the walls where light can not reach from camera to sb600 flash .  
1	  How I wish I consulted this forum BEFORE wasting my money ! Everyone agrees you need to buy new batteries every time you turn the camera on .. but besides that .. The software is terrible ! Not user friendly and as SLOW as molasses ! It takes almost a minute to download EACH PHOTO meaning for 30 photos , your computer is tied up for AT LEAST a half hour ! And you can't even go to another program while your waiting ! It 's locked on your screen ! ( It 's quicker to take your regular film to the One-hour photo and probably cheaper with the money you spend on batteries ! ) Now let 's talk about my red-eyed children with fuzzy faces .. aarrgghh .. don't get me started ! Don't do it ! There has got to be better ..  
1	  I got the WRT54GS to replace the earlier WRT54G model after it suddenly died at a modestly respectable age . After wasting two days trying to get it configured so that it would work with two laptops and two desktops , with security enabled , I gave up and switched brands to the D-Link DI-634M . At various times I got the Linksys working with each of the computers , but then when I would get another one set up , the previous one might become unreliable . The last straw was when my newest laptop would connect to the WRT54GS router and then lose its connection and reconnect repeatedly , at some regular interval between five and ten seconds , like clockwork . If you 're lucky , it is conceivable that this unreliable box could work for you , but I 've had much better luck ( and good speed and coverage ) after switching to the D-Link .  
2	  Got the camera based on the price and reviews on [ .. ] . Very portable and easily fits in your pocket / palm . Pictures taken with the auto settings were fine except in low light situations . There is not many manual settings to play around with , but this was expected even before the camera was purchased . Battery life is pretty good , on a trip to DC for 3 days had to re-charge the camera only once . Also purchased a1GB Xd Picture Card Type Halong with the camera . It is a must if you want to take more than 4-5 pictures at a time ( with the 16MB card provided with the camera ) .  
1	  I can't imagine why an ergonomic product , designed to ease physical effort / strain would require greater effort / strain in the most frequently pressed key , the space bar . I won't regurgitate the design flaw , since others on this board have mentioned ( which I regret having accessed only after receiving the keyboard ) , but I have put it back into the box to return . I usually try to avoid the hassle of returning things , but this keyboard is just too seriously flawed to overlook . Kudos to those of you who aren't bothered by it .  
1	  This player is a complete piece of garbage . Not ready for prime-time , but it was still rushed to the market . While the picture quality is excellent ( when it successfully plays DVDs ) as you would expect with the HD-DVD format , it takes up to * 2 minutes * to load up a DVD and start playing it . Just performing a power-up boot takes at least a minute . In addition it does not play DVD + R discs . In many cases it would not play any disc you insert into it and required several reboots to play it correctly . I returned mine immediately and instead got a Denon 1080p-upconverting player and am happy with the picture quality . Bottom line : Toshiba 's HD DVD players are not yet ready for prime-time . Besides , with the annoying fact that there are 2 competing formats for hi-def DVD ( VHS vs Betamax all over again ) I am going to wait until HD-DVD or Blu-Ray is declared the winner .  
2	  The outside of this case is beautiful . Still getting used to the squeaking that the handles make but hopefully that will stop once the material " breaks in " . The problem is with the inside . There is no room for your power cord , or any other accessories . My Intel MacBook Pro fits just right , with no eccess room for it to wiggle around , but once I added my external slim hard drive and the power cord , there was a noticable bulge and the zippers seem to be about to break . The fruit " person " pattern on the inside is also a little annoying . For the outside of the case , the inside could hae been anything other than whatever this fruit person is supposed to be .  
2	  I really love my Ipod I dont know how I lived without it before . It is great for working out . Not having to have a big floppy cd is great . The sound is awesome . Another thing that is great is some of my cd 's skip but you can download them on the ipod and the song is perfect again . 1,00 soungs is perfect for me I only have 200 songs so far and thats too many too listen too in one day . You can delete them if you want to also . This is a great buy for what you recieve . I love it !  
2	  This laser toner cartridge works great , no problems at all . Quality product at a price within my budget !  
2	  I 've been using Targus bags for years . My last one was the 17 " CityGear bag which i 've had since 2007 for my 17 " macbook pro . As I recently purchased a 15 " MBP , the 17 " was just too big ! I landed on the CityLite 15 " and I have to say that i 'm pleased with it . I has enough space for the laptop , charger , mouse , iPad ( in an otterbox defender case , which is impressive ! ) , and other ' ditties ' that I carry around with me . The quality of the bag is pretty good , but i am concerned about how long the shoulder loops will last . I have a lot of stuff in the bag and the last thing I need is for them to break .  
1	  I bought this through amazon and used to connect it to my PS3 DVD and TV ( all Sony products . After a month the picture became snowy and it no longer switches automatically . I had to send it back to Audiovox through UPS ( $ 14 ) because they will not accept it through regular mail . ( Audiovox owns Terk . They recieved the switch Jan 22 , 2008 and untill now they have not sent me a replacement . Called them several times , first they don't know why I have not received a replacement , 2nd they cannot find in their system if the replacement was sent , 3rd they said it was on back order and will send it in April . It 's been 2 months ! DON'T BUY ANY AUDIOVOX PRODUCTS , THEY ARE WORTHLESS !  
2	  This little camera seems ok for the limited use for which I purchased it . The one drawback is that I use it with my laptop , which has a slight curve to the top of the screen . The cam has a hard time staying level , and holding tight enough to stay in place . In addition , the wire that goes into the back of the camera prevents me from tilting it up to the best angle for my sitting position . Therefore I am always looking down at the camera , instead of looking at it straight on . My issues are not with the camera itself as you can see , but rather with the little stand .  
1	  I purchased this printer in Dec 2004 and in August 2005 it started printing blank pages . I thought Epson had a good reputation for reliable , good quality printers but I was mistaken . I called tech support with the issue ( I tried emailing and received no response ) , and was told they don't know of this as a widespread issue with this model ( I guess they never searched the web ) . They sent me a replacement printer , and only after I received it , they told me I 'd need to include the proof of purchase when I sent the old model back . The model itself is still under a year old . I am waiting to see what will happen with that . When the replacment model arrived , I put printer ink I purchased from Epson in this replacement model but the printer is telling me those cartridges are out of ink . Great , so I wasted another $ 80 on printer ink that doesn't work . I 've heard varying reports that if you don't use the printer a lot the problem will occur or as soon as you change the ink the problem occurs . Epson tech support told me don't use cartridges after 6 months because they " expire " - great another money making scheme from Epson . The implication is that using " expired " ink could cause problems with the printer . This is not a solid product and I will not buy any more Epson products in the future .  
2	  The Yamaha RX-497 AM / FM Stereo Receiver is an elegant piece of electronics . It produces high fidelity sound with lots of power . The front panel is intuitive and easy to use . The FM antenna is better than some add-on antennas I 'd purchased previously . In addition to the radio , I count seven auxiliary inputs on the back ( including XM radio ) and two sets of speaker jacks so the amplifier has lots of flexibility . Remember to check the dimensions , the receiver is big .  
1	  I bought this router so I wouldn't monopolize the DSL line in our house when playing Everquest . The problem is that when I use this router Everquest always disconnects within 5 minutes . I made three calls to tech support without resolving the problem , though we did eventually narrow it down : the router seems to insist on holding onto a few port addresses that Everquest expects to use for itself . After several long waits for short and unsuccessful conversations with tech support I tried using their web site to reach a resolution . I posted my case in July . Now it 's October . I can still see my posting on the site , but I never received anything other than an automatic acknowledgement of the problem report . The box won't do the one thing I need . The phone support is ineffective . The web support is non-existent . Money wasted .  
1	  I have had this all in one and have really really liked it , however it uses 460w when starting up or copying or doing just about anything and that is too much for my house wiring . We got constant light flickering and if it was printing and you ran another power hog then it would trip the breaker . Brother would not help .. it is really a shame since this unit really does everything it says and fast ( the fuser takes all that power to heat up ) . If you have a new house then you should have no problem , I am afraid I had to return mine .  
1	  Why spend more for a top-quality optical cable with a brand name like Monster ? In the digital realm , the bits are either getting to your amplifier , or they 're not . It 's hard to imagine how one optical interconnect could be better than another . Better cables matter when you are connecting speakers , but I can't see how they would matter here . So , buy something cheaper . Or , write another review , if you can explain to us consumers why this might be better .  
1	  If Call Waiting matters to you .. I bought this and used it for a couple of hours before realizing that it did not support Call Waiting AT ALL ( unless you consider hanging up on your current call acceptable ) . The omission of such a commonplace phone system feature should have been stated up front - it was not . The " workaround " suggested by the Plantronics support staff is simply absurd and involves a five step process to " flash " over to the incoming call . As conveyed by the Plantronics support personnel : 1 . Pick up your phone / press Talk on your phoneNote : The step above may require a short sprint if you don't carry your phone around with you . 2 . Hang up the headset ( this is NOT OPTIONAL , see below ) 3 . Flash over to the incoming call using your phone 's Flash / Talk buttonYou are now talking to your new party on your PHONE4 . Click the headset button to turn the headset back on5 . Hang up your phone . You must repeat steps 1 - 5 to return to your original call . The Plantronics web site FAQ states the following : = Can I switch between calls ( " Flash " feature ) using the headset ? If the user is on a call using the headset and receives another incoming all , pressing the headset button will simply hang up the current call but will not transfer to the new incoming call . * Important note : The " Flash " feature is deactivated when the CS55H headset is turned on . In other words , if the user turns the phone back on during an incoming call in order to view incoming Caller ID , pressing the " Flash " button on the handset will not switch to the other call . = That said , the call quality and range of the headset was excellent and if call waiting / switching between calls is not important to you then you 'll probably be very happy with it .  
2	  I got these headphones because my friend recommended me them . For 16.99 , they are probably the best pair of headphones you can get . The sound quality is just excellent and it is very mobile and comfortable . PROS : - Excellent sound quality for under $ 20 * Good bass , a good amount , though not too much * Crisp , clear sound - Comfortable fit even for a big head like mine - Long Cord , if youre at home , it 's a benefit - Lightweight - FlexibleCONS : - Need to position correctly in order to exprience full quality - Long Cord , if you 're outside it 's a disadvantage ( but just rubber band part of the cord to shorter it ) - Cheap PlasticNot made of the best materialClearly the pros outweigh the cons ( some of which are negligible ) So get it !  
1	  System looks great . It probably sounds great too . Package comes with 5 speakers , 1 subwoofer , a large assortment of wires and cables , AND NO INSTRUCTIONS ! I studied medicine , not acoustic engineering . I called AMAZON , and they told me that I either had to send the system back , at a cost of about $ 80.00 , or contact the manufacturer . None of the websites for " Genius Home theater " are active , so I can't reach them . If anyone out there knows how to hook one of these up , please let me know . Finally got this configured properly . Was actually pretty simple . Guess I 'm just dense . Sounds fabulous , and that 's really all that counts .  
2	  This is a great buy for anyone at all . The sound is absolutely amazing ! I could not believe that such a big sound was coming from such a small machine ! The only downside for me , a technology lover , was the missing Audio Cable Input so that you can plug in your electronic device ( such as an iPod or a CD Player ) through its headphone jack . But still , this thing is amazing !  
1	  This worked the day I received it , but now 2 months later when T-storm season has started and I actually need it , it doesn't work at all ! It 's hard to imagine that a power surge got it since it has been sitting unplugged on a shelf . Terrible .  
1	  these are some of the worse headphones i have tested the sound is horrible and tiny using an ipod touch no bass what so ever . i guess i have not learnt my lesson sony seems to have the best sounding headsets for this price range .  
1	  Ok the thing is is that they really do fit well . BUT ! The sound is reversed , the instromentals ( spelling ? ) are put louder and the vocals are bearly there . and i know that the tape was working so .. don't get it though it 's not very good at all .  
2	  I give it a 4 out 5 stars . Pro : Cheap , does its job , easy to screw on / off . Con : Annoying reflection . It also saved my lens from destruction . My little cousin accidentally knocked down my tripod with my Nikon on it , and the next thing I know my filter is shattered and in a horrible condition . However , my lens was unharmed & good to go :)  
1	  We bought this for our teenage son for Xmas and it was busted by March , although it had not received unusual use . We wrote the company and got some help that was not helpful . It seems that it is too fragile for real use .  
2	  The Epson Pervection V750 Pro is a good scanner . What I can't figure out is the instructions for the software are generic so they may be talking about features that are not included in the paticular software purchased . For example they talk about how easy it is to calibrate the scanner 's color . They refer to a bar code printed on the 4x5 transparency included . The 4x5 included with my scanner did not have a bar code . I had to go to a web site and down load the calibration file . As usual I think the owners manual was written by and engineer and never test driven by someone unfamilar with the operation of the software . I 'm no dummy and have been using PhotoShop for 15 years but their directions definately have room for improvement . The users forum I found worthless . Hardware is good but suport and software directions stink .  
1	  I bought the Coolpix 4300 and had nothing but problems . When I contacted Nikon they gave me such a run-around that I finally gave up in frustration and threw it away . It was , by far , the worst camera I ever had . I wouldn't buy another Nikon product unless you are ready to throw your money away . They have cheapened their cameras and minimized their customer support . And this is from someone who has attened the Nikon School and has an F2 with many extra lenses and features . I am listing them on E-Bay and unloading everything Nikon . They used to have a good reputation .  
2	  Well my hubby can't hear even with hearing aides and this Sennheiser is great , We don't have to blow the neighbors off the walls with the sound he had on 25-30 and me I have excellent hearing ..  
1	  I bought one of these disks for backup . It worked finefor a few weeks , and then failed . I had it replacedunder warranty , but the replacement disk also failedafter a couple of weeks . I had that one replaced too , and the THIRD disk has now failed after a few weeks . Definitely not worth considering this product . Thecasings get very hot and there is no fan - possibly acooling problem is responsible for the repeatedfailures .  
2	  I bought this item today . I have 2 laptops ( Windows XP , Vista ) . First connected the router followed the instructions by the CD and switched on the router the software was not deducting the router and said error 322 router not found . Tried several times , same result in both the laptops with different operating systems . Reset the modem , router still same issues . The software still could not go beyond detecting the router . Finally gave up and called the customer service . Like a reviewer earlier said it was frustrating , I had to drop off the call and try myself . Unsuccessful I called again and this time a lady walked me through the set up . They basically make you ping your local host via the IE and setup the rest of the installation for you . Overall it took me 2.5 hours to set up the router . The performance of the router is very good . That 's why 4 stars . But I am not sure why the software would not deduct the router in first place . When router is deducted , setup is a breeze in 5 mts . The firmware says v7.2 . Update : 11/02/2008 . The wireless is dying 3 - 4 times everyday . The ethernet is connected to my work VPN so cannot reboot when I am working just because wireless is not working . At best this product is only an ethernet adaptor . I wish i revert my 4 stars to 1 star . Bought a new NETGEAR RangeMAX wireless N router . This is way better than the linksys . Setup was so easy just quietly followed the instructions and I am seeing a speed of 117mbps in wireless . At best the Linksys shows 54mbps briefly before going down to annoying 5 mbps just 30 feet away .  
2	  I bought this router to replace a Netgear 802.11b router that I 've used for a couple of years . This one worked from the time I plugged it in . The DSL service I use required some changes to the MTU setting to pass along secure webpages , but the customer support solved it easily and it 's described ( a little obscurely ) in the online documentation from Linksys . com . It provides good distance ( > 100 feet at highest speeds ) and solid connections .  
1	  I bought this adapter a few days ago only to find out that is is not compatible with my PC running on Windows 7 . review the compatibility with your current operating system before buying it because it seems that only works correctly with windows xp . I even called belkin and they dont take responsibility for issues of compatibility . The worst of all , it does not say anywhere in their website that this device does not work with windows 7 . Be alert before buying it !  
1	  Product failed after 4 months of very light use . Canon was initially responsive and sent a replacement print head , but that failed to resolve the problem . Canon refused to replace or give a refund . Was convinced by top Consumer Reports ratings that Canon was top notch manufacturer . Don't be fooled . Buy an HP .  
1	  It appearred esy to setup . The docs said " requires an IDE drive " so I plugged one in ( an old one ) . It didn't work and I found this in the help : " If the green LED blinks 4 times at 1 ~ 2 second intervals , there is an ATA5 or older IDE hard disk plugged to SC101 that is not supported . SC101 works only with ATA6 or newer IDE hard disks . "  
2	  The Arkon stand gets high marks for almost all attributes , though it could hold my Xoom tablet at little higher angle in portrait orientation . ( I 'll play with it to find a configuration that does this . ) The compact fold-up form factor makes it easy to slip into the side pocket of my $ 15 HP sleeve along with data and audio cables . It looks like at Tootsie-Roll . ( That said , the $ 2 wire mesh business card holder I got at Office Max ( Item # 21196830 ) works perfectly in landscape mode on my desk . The gel skin on my Xoom protects it from any scratches and the card holder puts the screen at a perfect angle . It 's not so hot for portrait mode - a little unbalanced - but hey , I have the Arkon too ! )  
1	  I purchased 13 sets of headphones for my computer lab at school in the end of November ( or beginning of December perhaps ) , and never received them .  
1	  I knew from the beginning I did not want an ipod because everyone had one . My sister owns a Sony NW-E507 Mp3 Flash player and she enjoys it a lot . So , I thought I would try the Sony Walkman Bean because I thought since the NW-E507 worked so well and we already had SonicStage installed on our computer ( I also did not want the same Mp3 player as my sister ) . Well , when I got the " bean " I thought it was pretty cool . It had a built in flash drive which was very handy , however the flimsy cover did not impress my very much . I was almost positive that within a week it was going to break .. and I was right . Another thing I did not like about the bean was that the control buttons were small and it was difficult for me to turn up the volume without stopping the song or changing albums . I am usually adept when it comes to technology but this Mp3 player is a little bit tricky . I must say one positive thing about it and that is changing the time and date settings was easier than on the NW-E507 ( plus , the name is cooler . ha ha )  
2	  I bought this bag to hold my Asus ee pc 8gb laptop . It has a 7-inch screen . This is the perfect sized bag for it , and there 's enough room for a little mouse and my flash drive case in the second pocket . There 's plenty of padding . I have dropped it once ( about 2 feet onto a wood floor ) , and my ee pc is just fine . Very good product . Well worth it .  
1	  The main problem regarding the compatibility issue with Vista and the fact it was not made known , but prominently so , is an extreme omission and misleading . I purchased it for the two reasons previously mentioned : to transfer data from my XP to my Vista PCs and keep them connected without the expense of having to set up a network ! Add my comments to those who previously reported these important issues regarding the above mentioned product . My advice : pay the extra money for the Belkin or check ALL reviews , not just the top 3 or so . Additionally , don't rely on the average rating as a guide before purchase as it can be misleading , depending on how many people who purchased the item and gave their opinions . Two people could be very happy and rate it five stars which would give the average a perfect five . Depending solely on that , you may be disappointed . Had four people given opinions : two high and two low , the rating could change approximately 50 % depending on how low the two low ones were . I don't know how often Amazon updates the average rate . It could be either they don't update it often or I don't know the hypothesis they use to arrive at the rating ( I worked as a statistician ) but it appears to make this product more highly rated than I believe it is . I should run my own analysis on this product to see how close it is . Very unhappy .  
1	  I have had this stand for about a year now . The height and adjustability are perfect . But the plastic material is flimsy , and it didn't take long for the little plastic pieces in the back that hold the stand in its desired position to break . So I 've been using it with major tape slapped across the back of the stand to keep it from collapsing ( which it still periodically does ) . I am now shopping for a new stand , one preferably made of aluminum .  
1	  We are having trouble getting it to download to computer . Not as easy as the instructions say . The first day she used it it froze several times . We had to replace the batteries , which was not a big deal . But it froze again and we had to take batteries out and reinsert them . When it is working she really enjoys it . We are unable to save any of the videos as it is not working with our new computer .  
1	  I purchased this item last week and it is already breaking . The little knob / bolt that latches into the clip is coming off already . Yes , I know it can unscrew , but that 's not what I 'm referring to . The plastic is breaking , which means that I will not be able to use this case anymore . I have not been rough with it , it has not caught on things . I simply wear it at work and I 'm very careful of it . I would not recommend anyone purchase this if they want to use the clip .  
2	  What can I say ? It works as advertised in my home-office environment .. which is maybe a huge compliment these days . I have an 8-port Linksys BEFSR81 router that I 've used for many years but needed more ports and wireless for laptops . One caveat .. If you are adding it as a second router like I did , there isn't a lot of documentation on the web ( and none included with the product ) for how to hook them in so everything can see everything else . The fundamental secret is to do something that is not really intuitive to non-experts .. plug the connecting ethernet cable into a regular , numbered , LAN port on ON BOTH routers . Plug your cable or DSL modem into the " Internet " port on the WRT54GL . This leaves the " Internet " port on the old router unused . By doing this , you haved " bridged " the two units and bypassed the " routing " functionality thus making all of the computers connected to both routers appear as if they were connected to one large one ( they are on the same " LAN segment " ) .  
1	  I have recently purchased several small iPod speakers . I was looking for a unit with good sound , bass , and access to my iPod controls . In all honesty , this item has medium sound quality ( at best ) , absolutely no bass , and no external iPod control . It 's very difficult to use considering that I have to unzip the unit to operate most of the iPod features ( view the iPod playlist , watch videos , use most controls and functions , etc . ) . This basically defeats the primary features and benefits of owning an iPod . Poor sound and lack of functionality translates to a 1 star rating .  
1	  The memory button rubber cover fell off when I took it out the box and it took a couple of minutes to come alive . Sold it to a friend and got a Kenko . Looked really nice too .  
2	  One word .. WOW . No buyer remorse at all . Colors are vivid and bright . Great purchase .  
2	  We love our GPS system however does have some hiccups with the directions . There are some places for what is around you that have gone out of business for years and have not been updated . New businesses are not updated either . At times it does take you a longer way instead of the shortest . But all in all good product . Easy to use . Love the bluetooth feature .  
1	  Purchased two frames as a Christmas gifts . Could not load pictures via usb cable . Tried loading off a memory card , but the frame would only display a few pictures available to load from the card . Went out and purchased a flash drive , loaded it , attempted to load pictures from flash drive to frame . Frame did not display anything from the flash drive , as if there was nothing plugged into it .  
1	  This is probably my first negative review , but my experience with this product was very bad . First , the PowerPanel software did not install , I was getting the Java class error . Contacted tech support several times - they couldn't help me . So I had to configure the automatic shutdown in Windows . When we had the power outages , this UPS didn't do the job . I set it to shut down my PC in 5 minutes , but it was shutting it down in about 5 seconds . I contacted the tech support again , and they told me that the problem was in my PC , that it had some kind of too short response time and recommended me to buy a different unit for $ 550 . Even if this was the case , there should be some kind of warning about this , telling the buyers that this unit doesn't work with all computers , otherwise people would buy useless thing . I have a very common Dell PC , so this should be a common issue . But this wasn't even a case . Luckily , I puchased this UPS from Costco , so I could return it at any time . I did this , bought a different brand for about the same price , and had no problems since . The software installed instantly , and the unit was shutting down my PC during the power outages as it should . The only reason I 'm giving this unit two stars instead of one is because the tech support was quite quick and responsive , although not really helpful .  
2	  I stayed up until 5:30 this morning reading this book - literally could not put it down . Like many readers , when I finally turned that last page and saw the acknowledgments , I was stunned at all the loose ends left all over . But that was it , so I turned off the light to finally get some sleep . Only I couldn't , because I was as disturbed by the story as my schedule was disrupted by it . I started thinking about the characters , about the good and the bad in them , about the things we do to our children , the many ways we get it wrong , even when we 're trying hard as we can to get it right . Poor Gam , for instance - probably low-intelligence and certainly ignorant and abused , who damaged her children and grandchildren by giving them all the guidance she knew and all the love she had . The adult characters got their adult relationships so wrong too , between relatives , races , employers & employees . . . . So much damage . What happens next ? Maybe the adults will finally look at the children and realize that whether or not Harriet is epileptic , Allison certainly is , and maybe Allison and her mother will get some badly needed counselling , esp . since Allison is getting close to remembering some things . Maybe one or both of Harriet 's parents will finally come through for her and start parenting her . Maybe she will be fine whether or not they do . But I don't think so , not in this novel 's world . I do think that Harriet may grow up to treat other adults and her own children better than her parents did , and that would be an accomplishment .  
2	  I selected this camera based on DV ( of course ) , the 18x zoom , and " Analog In . " Additional , " nice to have " features include IR shooting , and still camera mode . Be advised that while video performance is excellent , this unit is only an adequate still camera , and a low resolution one at that . Low-light performance is average - the inclusion of a small light is a nice touch . While feature packed , the menu system is a triffle cumbersome . Minor annoyances - No tape included with the camera , no svideo cable , and a remote control is an additional purchase .  
2	  I bought this along with the & # 34 ; Cable Matters Gold Plated Premium iPhone 4/4S , iPad 1/2/3 and iTouch Dock to HDMI Adapter w / Built-in Charger Cable & # 34 ; . It 's performed very well , I 've used it on a variety of LCDs and Plasmas and it 's done the job every time .  
1	  Using a Canon S45 and GE Card reader / writer . I bought two of these cards . They worked fine for a year or more , but both have failed within the last month and I 've lost some pictures that I 'd rather not have . I 'm not buying this brand again even it if is a lot of memory for the money .  
1	  This HD radio is not what I expected at all . The reception is terrible even with the antennas that were included . I 've had a chance to hear other HD radios and this one is very below standards . After 6 months use , my remote has buttons that no longer work . I 'd return it but it 's not worth the trouble . Live and learn . I give it a rare , " DON'T BUY THIS ITEM " !  
1	  It has been 11 days since I ordered the camera . I have not seen it yet . I cannot find a phone number to contact the store or obtain any customer service . It is not a good deal or a good product when you do not receive any service or the product .  
1	  I 'll cut to the chase : the materials used on this flashlight are too cheap for this thing to last . Case in point , the crank broke after just 10 days . 10 days ! Maybe a total of 25 minutes cranking max and now it is broken . Wish my experience was different as I love the idea . And now I wish the manufacturer had spent a little bit more on the materials .. I would have paid 10 more bucks to get something that would last . Alas , it is not much more than a paperweight now . Strongly advise you , the reader , to look elsewhere .  
1	  I bought this printer to replace my HP PSC 2175 that broke . Before that I had an HP 882C . My level of satisfaction has gone down with both purchases . I bought the C3180 and took it home , hooked it up , and it won't print magenta .. strange . I took it back and exchanged for another one . The second one won't print magenta . Very strange . I tried making 10 copies of a red book to see if it just needed to warm up .. I got 10 copies of a yellow book . Very frustrating ? Then I checked the ink level with the toolbox and the HP software reported that I had used 20 % of the color cartridge .. with 10 full color pages ? That is absurd . Even if I get this fixed , it will cost me a fortune to keep this printer full of ink . It 's going back to the store and I 'm coming home with a different brand . I used to be a loyal HP customer , but the quality of the printers seems to have degraded quite a bit .  
1	  I received a pair of Koss KSC75 earphones as a holiday gift ( from my wish list ! ) . I soon realized I need a case to protect the earpieces from snapping off and to keep the cord from getting tangled with all the other cords I have to carry . I must thank all of you who reviewed this case , since I learned from most of you that it 's rather large . I don't want it taking up too much space in my bag since I travel a lot and try to keep the bulk to a minimum . I looked at the smaller Koss case ( size " D " ) and a reviewer there said he had tried them for his KSC75s and that case is too small for them . Then I researched on Amazon and via Google for more than an hour , trying to find a case these would fit into but would not be unnecessarily large . So hard to tell ; often no dimensions are given . I found people posting picks of soap cases ( ! seriously ! a soap case by Mary Kay ! ) in which they were carrying their KSC75s , because * they * couldn't find a good case either . Then I just took a look around my house and found a Burberry sunglass case that fits these headphones perfectly . Done . So once again , thank you to all those who noted that this case is a bit too roomy for a pair of KSC75 earphones .  
1	  The device is unstable , and SanDisk support is incompetent . I 've gone through the RMA process with them about 7 times now . I would have loved to give up and get a refund from Amazon after the second new unit failed to work properly , but SanDisk took so long with the first RMA that I ended up outside the 30 day return for a full refund window . I am still playing the RMA tango with them 3 and a half months later .  
2	  I fit 3 light stands , 3 umbrellas , a disc holder , and assortment of flash and umbrella mounts , flexi-arms , mini-tripod , collapsible reflectors , and clamps . Fully loaded it weighs nearly a ton , but it 's super strong and looks like it will last for years . It keeps everything in one place and ready to travel . It 's exactly what I hoped for .  
2	  I can't speak for those people who have had problems with this card . All I can speak to is my own experience . Installation on my Compaq Presario was a snap . It worked with no problems except that sometime the connection can't be detected and then the computer has to be reset , but I can't prove this is the computer 's fault . Jason  
1	  Don't buy any Gateway monitor . They look good to start and get great reviews . But it will go out and Gateway will not stand behind it nor help you resolve the situation . Their monitors are known for dying within two years . I 'm still searching for a better monitor . Mine just went out .  
2	  I bought this backpack to replace a worn out , inexpensive model of another wheeled bag . This bag is head shoulders above the other one in quality . The wheels are large and sturdy , and the front has feet that are the right height to tip the bag backwards just a bit , so that when you 're filling it up , there is no worry about it tipping over forward . I have used the laptop sleeve for my 15 " laptop , it fits fine . It has a good number of pockets , and a useful water bottle holder on the outside . The construction of the handle feels very sturdy too . After a few weeks of use , I 'm very happy with this bag . Time will tell how sturdy it is , but I 'm hopeful that I 'll get at least a couple of years of use out of this . Plus , the animal print is kinda funky in a way I like . A co-worker of mine was grimacing at the print as we rode the elevator together . I looked at him and said , " Can you believe it , it was on sale ? " Haha .. I like it , to each their own !  
1	  Its OK as a product . It took way long to get here . Karin in Castle Rock  
1	  It works , barely . The headphone volume is very weak , but usable . However , the person at the other end cannot understand me unless I scream . The mic is not sensitive enough , and the headphone isn't much better .  
1	  Iron is charged on base .. takes about 3-4 minutes to get hot . Once removed from the base , the iron did not stay hot long enough to iron a pair of pants ( and I am very quick at ironing ) .. You have to place the iron back on the base to charge all over for 3-4 minutes . The iron base has a very short cord so it is not convenient to have to keep placing the iron on the base to charge for 3-4 minutes for every item of clothing you need to iron . The steam does not work like described . It leaked water as it cooled . The size of the iron is equivalent to a small travel iron . I am returning this . Normally I would keep it and just deal with it , but this one is really that bad .  
2	  Not sure what some of the problems were with the negative reviews but I highly suspect they did not know what they were doing . I 've burned over a twety DVDs with this brand , everything from backups , picture storage to my daughters home videos . Never had a problem with a single one of them . Only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I found a cheaper brand that also hasn't given me problems .  
2	  I bought my Linksys router three months ago , so my router 's been kicked around a little , and I have to say the router has been an incredibly worthwhile purchase . Being a starving student I had to shop around for the best and cheapest router . I did a lot of research on - and offline and after a lucky break at Best Buy that prevented me from getting the inferior WRT54G-my credit card was rejected-I discovered the superior WRT54GL here at Amazon and bought it ( The credit card went through this time ) . What puts the WRT54GL over the top of all the other dozens of routers I researched and other Linksys models was that it has twice as much Flash ( 8MB ) and RAM ( 16MB ) as the WRT54G and the WRT54GS and that it gets third party support . The third party firmware , DD-WRT , manages to not only improve the router but also compliment it with new features that the default firmware doesn't have while still being accessable to a moderately skilled computer user like myself . Setup was a breeze and once the router is connected it stays connected . In the three months I 've had it I haven't had the connection drop once and I 've used it daily with my laptop and to play video games online on my PSP and DS . I haven't noticed any difference in Web speed from being wireless or being connected right to the router and I download music and movies from iTunes quite a bit so I 'd certainly notice slowdown . I couldn't be happier with the Linksys WRT54GL . I feel I made the best possible purchase at the best price .  
2	  Purchased for a friend who loves music and takes her iPod everywhere so now she can listen to her music in her car .  
1	  OK .. first off , I am comparing these to another set of noise canceling earbuds that I own . I am comparing these to the Audio-Technica ATH ANC3BK ( gen1 ) . But here 's the lowdown .. Bad : Design : They are not very ergonomic and are not comfortableDesign : There is no clip for the very large battery / electronics sectionSound Quality : Horrible . No Bass , no matter how far you can manage to cram them in your earNow the good : Price : They are cheap . Overall : I 'm not going to return them because they were only like $ 17 and I spend more than that on coffee everyday . The sound quality is horrible and they are not comfortable . I only bought these because I was curious if cheaper earbuds were starting to become as good as the more expensive ones like my Audio-Technica ATH ANC3BK . I have come to the conclusion that cheap is still cheap and even though the technology is a rather simple technology , the companies that make the cheaper buds haven't quite figured it out yet . If you like music and if you like canceling annoying noises around you , these buds will disappoint you .  
1	  i managed to connect this " adapter " to my 3 1/2 " drive , but when i went to place the expanded drive into my 5 1/4 " bay , it was about 1/4 " shy . maybe it would work with some other bay , but not mine . useless .  
2	  I love this little player - it weights almost nothing , fits in the tiny coin pocket of a pair of jeans , and is really simple to use . My only complaint is that it hold very little music ( I think about 20 songs ) , and I can't figure out if you can buy another flash drive without buying the whole player , too ..  
1	  I read previous reviews on this item that said it doesn't work with their HP printer . I ignored the review and after ordering the ink cartridges , found out that it doesn't work on either of my hp printers ( Photosmart 7350 and hp 1200 all in one ) . Please don't make the same mistake that I made . Your just wasting your money .  
1	  Even with toner savings mode turned off and dark turned up all the way , it 's still too light . Yes , I 've tried 1 2nd cartridge , namebrand . Just having to turn the toner saver off and select dark means every single printout you have to click-click-click . The paper just hangs out , bent , and over time gets permanently bent . The plastic holders are exposed and break easily .  
2	  I worried about this DVD player because of some complaint . Ok . I 'll say " this has just 3.5 inch screen , and there is no speaker , and you have to use its own bettery which make this twice thicker . " So what ? I still love this . I knew those , and I can see what 's going on in the movie exactly , so that doesn't bother at all . If you lower your expectation level , you 'll have the perfect product . I shaked and tilt a little , but it was ok . I have another DVD Player from Samsung , and this is better in shock , at least , by now . My point is that what I got was not fragile . I love this .  
1	  This the worst netgear product ever , very difficult to connect . After connecting , error with IP assignment . The signal strength was also very bad . My old router has better signal strength ( MR614 ) than this 3 .. 4 generation of router .  
2	  I bought mine factory refurbed : came with auto bundle . About the battery 's short life : there 's an after market battery upgrade that I found listed here in amazon . com link : $U$ ad says 1500 mAh @ 3.7V so that 's triple the OEM bayyery ! The battery cost about $ 25 and comes with two screwdrivers and instructions on taking the iQue3600 apart . WARNING : taking the Garmin will void your garmin warranty .. SO BE WARNED ! All in all , I am having a great time with the GPS on my travels . around the USA .  
1	  When I received the cable the pins and connectors were pretty beat up . I wasn't able to plug either end into a DVI port . Had to take needle nose pliers and unbend a lot of metal . Cable works fine though now that I fixed the pins .  
1	  Widely advertised as the firste PocketPC PDA with integrated 802.11b wireless , the e740 looked like a great opportunity to synch with my PC over my company 's pervasive wireless net . Unfortunately , our IS department hasn't been able to figure it out , and Toshiba technical support won't ( " We don't provide support for active synchronization over a wireless network .. " ) or can't help . The e740 may just have a problem handling VPN , which provides security for the corporate network , but Toshiba support doesn't want to talk about it . Additionally , great expandability in a very thin package is offset by a dim ( compared to iPAQ ) display and an awkward-to-hold rectangular design . There are also some hiccups with ActiveSynch .. still , if I could get a wireless connection at work , I 'd consider it a good investment . Maybe it works for surfing the web at Starbucks , but if you need it to work at the office , make sure that somebody else already has one that works with your wireless network .  
2	  PNY Memory-always a good choice . Takes only a few minutes to install , and have never had any trouble with PNY .  
1	  This blu-ray worked fine for a couple months . Now it is the most frustrating piece of crap I own . I would have expected a knock-off brand to perform like this . Samsung took a big hit on credibilty with me by making such a piece of junk . The blu-ray freezes at some point during the movie , every time , even with brand new movies . You have to completely reboot the machine and fast forward to get back where you were . Do yourself a favor and do not buy this . I will probably not buy a Samsung blu-ray again because of how aweful this one is ..  
2	  I got one of these at work a few months ago ( I 'm a full-time programmer ) . I like it a lot . It has good action , is quiet , has standard placement for the cursor control keys between the numeric keypad and the regular keys ( 2 rows of 3 , not 3 rows of 2 like many others ) . I didn't install the drivers from the CD , but many of the functions still work ( XP pro ) , like volume , mute , email , browser . I don't use them that much , but now that I 'm buying one for home , maybe I 'll get more used to them . I like the fact that there aren't a zillion buttons to choose from like some others , so you don't get overwhelmed and don't have to look for what you want . I really don't think you can beat it for the price ( usually under $ 15 ) . The only bad thing is that when you reboot , you need to press a button to enable the standard function keys at the top ( there 's a light that tells you when it 's enabled ) . I often forget , but the first time it doesn't work , I remember . I don't really use them that much anyway - mainly just F5 for refresh .  
1	  I started having problems within a week of purchasing this item . The fans would just randomly stop working . I would have to tap on it and set it a certain way on the table for them to start working then , in the middle of a game / work / email etc I would shut down due to overheating because the fans stopped working . I realized if I maneuvered the cord a certain way the fans would come back on so this is how I used it for about a month and it not only stopped working 70 % of the time but after about 2 months I could no longer plug it in , the little metal thing that you plug the cord into was gone .. if I shook it I could hear it rattling around inside . I did not save the packaging and do not have my receipt but I know I paid over $ 30.00 for this piece of crap . Please , I am begging you , donate the money to charity before you throw it away on this product ! I couldn't choose less than 1 star .  
1	  After using for over a month the priter , - for reasons unknown - fails to print - advances 1 label & shows printer errors thereafter  
1	  Bought for my daughter in Sept but display began fading after a couple months and finally died in December . Annoying that it lasted just past the 30 day Amazon return , but not much more . Per Creative the cost is $ 25 non-refundable for " labor " diagnosing returns . That is outrageous ! Over % 25 of product cost for them to make it right ( assuming they honor the warranty ) . Due to the lack of medium term reliability with the added insult of paying for warranty service , I will never buy another Creative product .  
2	  I bought this DVD player as a backup / additional DVD player to my existing Sampo , mainly because my Sampo has a problem with playing some copied DVD 's . I wasn't planning on spending a lot of money , but I did want it to have some " basic " features . What I got for the price ( about 40 bucks after rebates ) was a lot more than I hoped for . This thing will play everything you throw at it . And I mean Everything . Virtually all formats are supported , including PAL / NTSC conversion , which allows you to play DVD 's from other countries ( a simple multi-region remote control hack is required for that ) . I 've heard some complaints about reliability and support , but I have never experienced any problems myself in over 2 years that I 've used this player . Also , I think the problems are only existent on 300 series models , as this is a higher end model , and Cyberhome might have addressed previous issues . The bottom line is I 'm very happy with it and would highly recommend it to other people .  
2	  The Slingbox AV is small and easy to install . I wish I got it sooner .  
1	  Software that runs this printer makes MSDOS look like Apple Snow Leopard . I 'm presently trying to print one lousy paragraph from Text Edit . The printer has a 10 minute Hissy Fit Light Show , spits out 20 sheets of blank paper , then jams halfway through the paragraph . An absolutely Epic Failure of a machine .  
2	  This filter is for me just a lens protection . I feel more comfortable when using this filter on my expensive lenses and it do not degrade the quality of my pictures .  
2	  This case is very well made . It is very durable and holds ALOT ! The only drawback is thte disks tend to slide out of the holders if you aren't careful . I have bought 3 so far , and will continue to buy this particular case .  
2	  These radios work well . You just have to take the advertised distance with a grain of salt . In real life conditions , the range is nothing close to 26 miles . It is more like a few miles .  
1	  Overall this product has been so-so at best . For the money I was expecting a lot more . A much cheaper point and shoot camera would have been better . The image stabilizer doesn't work well . Anything past 4x seems like you should have a tripod . Many shots come out blurry . I always had to take a few shots with the flash and with out to see which would turn out best . I could probably keep an average of 1 out of 4 shots taken . When I did use the flash , if i was closer than a few feet away i would get a shadow from the lense blocking the flash on the subject . And the kicker : 2 weeks after the year warranty and my camera is unusable . Worked fine on Halloween most of the day , take it back out of the bag and I get a message that says to " Remove Lens Cap and Press > Button " . Normally you would see this if the lens cap is on . It isn't . I can now only view pictues is playback mode , the lens doesn't move at all . If you want a higher end camera , spend the money and buy a high end one . This one is too bulky to be something you can stick in a pocket . I decided to forgoe the convenient size for the features which weren't worth the extra cost . This is the second panasonic product that has died on me in the last 2 months .. no more panasonic for me  
1	  I could not get this product to work on my ' 99 Ford Explorer . I may have just bought a bad one . I didn't bother sending it back . I ended up buying one that you insert a key into the electronic circuit , and it works great .  
1	  I have had my m125 for over 1 year now . Really I have loved it and what I have been able to do with it . What I hate is the unreliability with the batteries and whether I will face a total data loss when I swap batteries every 2 weeks or so ( we have also faced a hot sync problem with multiple users ) . When I called to ask Palm if this was a recurring problem with m125s the man tried to charge me $ 25 to get the question answered . Then when I refused to pay $ 25 for the question , the rep actually laughed at me . So I took it took the next step and submitted an e-mail asking the same question and requesting the company 's complaint process . PalmOne did respond , however not to any of my questions . Apparently they do not resolve complaints . Oh but they 'll give me a 20 % upgrade discount on select models online - whatever . The most information I received was actually reading the other reviewers here at Amazon and their problems with batteries .  
1	  This is the second non-workable COBY radio I purchased from Amazon this month . The clock and the display do not function , at all . COBY radios are total junk and selling them is cheating consumers . I will not return either radio ( too much trouble ) as a lesson to myself . DO NOT BUY COBY>Shame on Amazon for selling this kind of cheating Junk .  
2	  I 've researched and purchased a number of cameras for our school . The Olympus line tends to be the most durable and trouble proof .. and the Olympus 510 providing the most bang for the buck . Don't bother with the included software . Go ahead and download the USB driver ( available from the Olympus website ) if you 're using Windows 98 and use the camera 's drag and drop recognition . Invest about $ 25 in a NiHi set of AA batteries and charger ( any Radio Shack carries them ) and you have a great , rechargable system . I usually purchase several SmartMedia cards and swap them out like rolls of film until I can get to a computer to download my photos . The resolution is excellent and when printed on regular photographic paper , is indisguishable from photos taken with a mid range 35mm camera .  
2	  Tiffen , always being my number 1 choice . At larger f-stops and wide angle ( 18mm or so ) I get some vignetting - although it is stacked on top of a Tiffen UV filter . Wishing I would have purchased the ' lower profile ' filter .  
1	  Featurewise this is a nce machine and lcd screen although very small but you can view video very well . But it is poorly built and equally bad is Archos customer service . One of the buon my juke box dislodged after a month of use and it is not workig now and I can not access features controled by this button ( F2 ) n . If I have to do this again I won't spend money on this piee of junk .  
2	  I purchased this switch because my Airport Extreme didn't have enough ports for my home . It is reliable and has excellent speeds . It 's truly plug-n-play .  
2	  This is a great lightweight product that does everything it says it does . I like to travel compact when I go out shooting . This thing is only a little fatter and larger than a CF card and is virtually hollow so it carries like a little chunk of plastic . All you need is the simple USB to mini USB cable to connect it to either mac or pc . Simple , but great product .  
1	  I got this as a gift i had it for one day and it broke . I gues it couldnt handel the music on it all i played on it was Dazed and cunfused from in thru the out dorr album ( led Zepplin ) it started it started to act up when the earphone port was making my speakers all staticky and then i treid putting a new set of ear phones in it but still static then i turned it off and it wouldnt turn back on i charged it for 6 hours still didnt turn on . Well i dont think i would recomend this product i only had it for a day and it broke . but i can still rely on my trusty creative muvo slim mp3 player ..  
1	  having the wires protrude from the end of the connector is a great idea . It makes the connection very tight with minimal untwisted wire . It also reduces errors by being able to see which wires are where . The problem with this connector is the position of the clip that keeps the connector in the socket . The position of the clip is such that when the wires are crimped ( using a regular crimp tool ) , it causes the clip to be pressed against the connector thereby rendering it usesless . The resultng connector is fine , but will not stay put in the socket . If using the Platnum Tools crimp tool is a must then it should be clearly stated so . Queries to the company regarding this yielded no response whatsoever . The strain relief sleeve is very fragile and can easily be torn off the solid part .  
1	  There was no problem in its installation , and I was enjoying the net surfing for 4 months . Suddenly it drops the connection to DSL modem ( SBC pac-bell is a provider ) , and I have to give it a cool down . It works next two days , but it drops again .. , Their support line is always busy . I will buy another router from Netgear .  
1	  My Ipod mini was given to me for my birthday in May , 2004 . Almost one month and two returns to AppleCare , I still do not have a properly functioning mini . I have heard the warnings about the problems that are typical to the mini yet I thought it wouldn't happen to me . When I first got it , it seemed to work fine , however it froze after the first ten minutes of use . My friends who also have iPods told me that this was normal . Then it happened every time I used it . AppleCare suggested that I reset the device when that happens . The problem was that I was resetting it constantly ( and losing the music in the device ) . Other problems soon followed . My unit could not recognize being charged or the music in my Itunes library . I was getting strange icons on the screen that weren't in the User 's Guide ( and only one iPod expert out of the twelve I dealt with knew what the icon meant ) . I sent it back to Apple once and they said it was fine , apparently looking for a problem unrelated to my unit . I really had to struggle with AppleCare to have them look at it again . They had me reload and update versions of software that didn't help and constantly tried to sell me expensive consumer protection plans . I spent hours on the phone with them . I guess the good people at Apple have a hard time admitting that they too are capable of making a dud , or as I now call my device , an iDud . Now I am waiting for my Ipod to come back from service again . I realize that this is an exception and there are many of you out there who I love your iPods , but if you do get a faulty unit it will be a long and difficult struggle to remedy your situation . In the end , it wasn't worth it . I now just want my device to simply work and the giver of this generous gift to feel happy that he didn't waste his money . Hopefully by my next birthday it will be functioning .  
2	  This camera is great ! I find that the pictures are studio quality . Just have to get used to all the different settings . Definitely recommend this to everyone .  
2	  I use this filter on my 50mm 1.4 cannon lens . It works what more can I say . I shoot allot of video with that lens and I have had nothing but success with the filter .  
2	  This piece of equipment is a piece of pleasure . Took me a total of 15 minutes to set up the router and install the card on my laptop . The 802.11g range is much more better than the 802.11b , Speed is amazing , Nice Security features . Definitely recommended A + .  
1	  Logitech offers no support for OS X. If you think you 'll be able to program this mouse for even simple stuff , think again . Also really noisy ! I gave mine away to a windows user . A bit misleading in advertising it 's Mac compatibility .  
1	  This device does not work nearly as well as advertized . It took a long time to set up and program properly with the base unit , it frequently drops the signal , and we have to reboot it . It beats not having a signal repeating component , but it certainly has flaws . The set-up can , if it does not go flawlessly , bring tears to your eyes .  
2	  awesome product . even better with a speck case . i got one and it had a loose click wheel . apple replaced it and its awesome .  
1	  The connector did not meet expectations : simply put , the sound coming from the headphones with the connector used , is extremely low , whereas with the same headphones without a connector , the sound is decent . Look elsewhere .  
1	  its alot cheapter at Best Buy and you do not have to pay shipping , nor do you have to wait months .  
2	  so when i order i feel ok that its not a fake orderhard to put it onyes to my frends  
1	  I bought this camera after owning an Olympus digital camera for years . I was extremely happy with my Olympus , but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since I 'm expecting . This camera was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT . Just about every single picture I took had huge white blobs all over it . ( This only happened when using the flash . I must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash . ) Plus , if you used the zoom at all , the pictures came out fuzzy . The first digital camera I ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! The store I bought the camera from wouldn't take it back because I waited two days past the 14-day return policy . So , I sold the camera and took a $ 100 loss . I 'd much rather lose $ [ .. ] than keep this camera .  
2	  I have bought 30 of these for my company . They work flawlessly as long as your computer is properly maintaned . Do all the updates and don't put a lot of junk on it . I do Desktop support and highly recommend this product .  
1	  I have owned HP all-in-one products for years and years . This ink eater wont even let you finish using the ink in the cartridges ! I take a cartridge out and shake it only to find there is still a noise of a solution ( ink ) left in it BUT the software says you are out of ink , only use HP ink ( very expensive ) and you cannot refil because a software setting . If you don't replace the " empty " ink cartridge , then the printer will shut down on you and be rendered inoperable .. The software actually tells you that in a message on your screen . Makes you feel so glad you bought the horrible thing . Purchasing this printer is nothing more that supporting a recurring expensive cost of ink . I HATE MINE and will sell it real cheap but not to anyone I know .. I 'll never buy HP again ! Jerks !  
2	  100 % satisfied . Product works great and is easy to use . Sound is excellent and it 's a wonderful thing to have in the car ! Great value and great quality . You will be pleased if you purchase this item .  
1	  I have been a faithful SONY customer all my life ( TV , Computer , Laptop , Camera , Home Theatre , etc ) until I bought my latest KDL-46S2000 ; then things changed . For starter , it has only one HDMI port ; which means , you can either get HD reception from your Cable or Satellite antenna , or your DVD player , or Camcorder . To get around it , you have to unhook one , and hook the other one , every time ; it is very inconviniant and unpleasant . The picture quality is OK , but I compare that to my Sony Tube TV , and not with similar LCD HD TV 's in the same price range ; if compared with others , Panasonic and Samsung provide much better quality , brightness , and speed . Speed ? Yes , speed . When you watch an action movie , sports , or any fast moving TV program , the TV freezes ; or a big portion of screen turns into Chess type squares with fuzzy colors . I know I have been a loyal customer of SONY , but looking at this product , I know I would have had a much better TV if I were looking at other brands . And that 's what I will do the next time I buy any electronic product .  
2	  This new version of ergonomic keyboard is SWEET ! I poured coffee into my original one ( 5-8 years old ? ) and was hesitant to order this model . The reviews were mixed . Don't let any negativity prevent you from buying this model ! I have one small request .. wish it had a printed owner 's manual . There are so many improved keys but it would be nice to have the function and possibilities of each spelled out in print for reference . Other than that one little request , this one 's a keeper !  
2	  I have been putting systems together for 10 years now and this case is pure joy . Its not too large and not too small . The airflow is excellent and with all the included fans set to low I can only hear the one on my 8800GT . ( thinking of replacing vga cooling now ! ) Simply moving my rig into this case from a no-name mid tower resulted in my cpu load temps dropping from 50-55c to 45-47c max after hours of gaming . Ambient temps followed suit with 5c or so off mobo temps and another 7-10c drop on my 8800 . The packaging was robust and arrived in excellent condition despite UPS shipping . The included case hardware is fantastic with plenty of motherboard standoffs and assorted screws etc . Also , all of the drive bays are outfitted with thumbscrews which is a great combination of true ' tooless ' designs and the security of screws . No plastic snap in drive mounting and pci slot retainers here . One con is well known with the 900 and that is cable management but that can be addressed with clever positioning of the hard drive racks and some zip ties . My PSU is not modular so I had to spend the extra time to reduce clutter . Also , if you run crossfire or sli setups you may have to be more creative with the drive racks to make sure modern vid cards will fit . However it can be done . The top mountd USB , 1394 , and audio ports are great and easy to connect . All and all oustanding purchase . Rig : AMD phenom II 720 Black Edition , 4gb Mushkin ddr800 , corsair 550 PSU , LiteOn DVD burner , 2 Sata HDD , XFX 4850 , Gigabyte GA-MA790X-DS4 mobo .  
1	  The dock worked OK with my Denon 2808 for about 1 month and then just stopped working at all . The receiver can not communicate with the dock and does not get the signal from the iPod . Piece of junk .  
1	  I would have rated it NO star if I could . I bought new battery and it still does not work . I read the instruction from the manual carefully and change my camera setting correctly . It does not work . I was too late to get a refund because I found out too late ( 30 days return policy ) DON'T BUY IT !  
1	  The Emerson Large Display Caller id product was defective . The number display showed only " parts " of the numbers , and the actual display was cut off at the left and unreadable . The vendor via email seemed fine and Maxi-aids agreed to processing a return but I had to provide my own return labelling and postage . I actually didn't know before this that Amazon doesn't cooridnate returns with outside vendors listed on the site , and as a result of my experience on this purchase , will never buy anything that lists a vendor as the purchase agent . It was a complete rip off . I 've never had a problem with " Amazon " backed purchases , but with this product via this vendor , no refund was ever processed . I lost not only the product cost and shipping , but also return shipping to send the defective item back . Costly . Awful . Don't buy this product . Also , this vendor is not recommended .  
2	  works really well . i messed up the stickers a little so it gets caught when i try and take the screen off . make sure you put the stickers as far out as possible on the edge of the screen .  
2	  best carmera i have you most pixel for your bucks . the color application are cool too . would make a great gift  
1	  This camera stopped working only after 6 months . The optical zoom lense got stuck often . The display screen went blank , and now it is completely useless .  
2	  I bought this to use on Skype . I installed it using the enclosed disc . When I used it with Skype , the microphone sound worked , but I couldn't get the video to work with Skype ( " Not Skype compatible , use an updated driver " ) . I downloaded another driver from Microsoft . Still didn't work . Finally , I uninstalled the webcam , and simply plugged it in , opened Skype , and it worked just fine ! Good product for the money .  
2	  This little fella does everything well . The operating system is intuitive and the help prompts are clear and written for the novice . I purchased the base model from Apple for $ 499.00 and was pleasantly surprised to learn that the processor had been upgraded to a 1.33 GHz G4 unit and had 512 MB of RAM . With the addition of a refurbished LaCie DVD / CD burner for $ 62.00 , and my internet connection , I have been archiving a friend 's 3000 piece , courtesy of Hurricane Katrina , inundated CD collection . Itunes is able to convert the CD 's at an essentialy lossless level to Mp3 's which I have archived to DVD 's . The CD 's of a lifetime collection have been saved . The music now resides on a seagate firewire hardrive more convenient , searchable and portable than 3000 CD 's . If a mac mini is only used to hold your music collection it is well worth the price . With an Apple Airport Express $ 129.00 you can play your audio files over your home stereo . This little puppy doesn't come with a monitor , keyboard or mouse . If you don't have an extra keyboard and mouse check out Amazon listed " Microsoft Business Hardware Pack " - $ 30.89 . You can buy a 17 in Samsung CRT Monitor at Sam 's for $ 99.00 . And what about the internet - at least for now - the Mac OS has been immune to almost every internet virus or spyware compromise . When I was forced to evacuate the gulf coast for hurricane Katrina and Rita - the space in my car was at a premium . My mac mini was in the back seat - all my records , contacts , and personal information escaped with me . Recently upgraded ram from 512 to a full GB . It 's an easy do-it-yourself and was kind of fun . caslo  
1	  once again I thought cheap would win and it didnt - ate the very first CD and never spit it out - fm reception not good - if it didnt have the aux in and the usb in , it would be on display up on hiway 280  
2	  Since Lenovo no longer includes options for which type of trackpoint cap you get this package is very helpful if you don't find the ( appearant current default ) " Soft Dome " cap to your liking . This pack contains one of each of three styles , the " classic dome " ( small textured dome , relatively hard , the classic trackpoint cap ) , the " soft dome " ( softer , with a wider top ( mushroom shaped ) and studded to provide traction , the current default style on newer Lenovo products ) and the " soft rim " cap ( similar to the ' soft dome ' cap but a smooth top with a thick raised edge ) . I find that while the soft dome and soft rim caps a quick and comfortable they don't offer the precision of the classic dome and , due to their overhanging shape , sometimes interfere with my typing ( my fingers will catch the edge of the cap instead of striking the keys immediately surrounding it ) . Also useful if your current cap is accumulating dirt or has been worn down . Installation is exceedingly simple , just pull the current cap upwards until it pops off and then press the new one on ( just turn it so that the square shaped cutout in the base is roughly oriented to match the stud that it is supposed to fit on ) .  
1	  Please do not buy from this seller . Even though I have not bought anything from them , the price they have put up for this One600 Ultra Instant Camera is shocking ! I do own this camera , but I got it brand new at Target for around $ 40 . Here they are asking for $ 128.09 ? ! ? ! That 's clearly insane . Why pay for that much when it 's available for so much cheaper . This seller is clearly greedy and hoping to benefit from an unsuspecting soul by bleeding them dry ! DO NOT BE FOOL AND DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN $ 40 . And that goes for all the greedy sellers over at Ebay selling this same camera for crazy amounts ! Purchase wisely and shop around for the best price before you commit to buying anything ! I 'm rating this solely on the seller 's price and not on the product itself .  
2	  I 've had mine for two years now and it is an outstanding case . The humidification sponge in the case leaves a lot to be desired . I have sacrificed one of the cigar slots and put aDrymistat Humidifier Tubein its place and it keeps my cigars perfectly for months between refills . I carry my with me everywhere .  
1	  Looking on here it seems many of us are having the same problem , that this card works initially then just drops the internet for no particular reason , the strange thing is windows 7 says that there is a internet connection , but the browser doesn't work , I thought it might be my router ( Linksys ) but my laptop doesn't drop connection so I guess it must be this card . Btw I am connected at the moment fine , this is the problem I get on for a while then it will just drop out , hard to know what the cause is and very stressful if ones needs to use the internet . I actually came on here to look for a new card and by the sounds of it I need one , what a bummer .  
2	  I liked this device at first sight . A very nice design which goes very well with my Rio MP3 player . The reception is cranky at times and I think it could be better . But overall I am satisfied with this unit .  
1	  I purchased this system because of the wireless capabilities , well right out of the box the wireless tower does not work . Not a good start ! I will be calling support today . To be continued . Well strike two and I 'm done . I sent the first one back because the wireless tower did not work right out of the box . They sent me another one , and guess what ? It didn't work either . When I talked to Samsung support they sounded as if this was happening a lot ? I think they need to work the bugs out before they ship the product out .  
2	  The headset is very confortable , the microphone is very fine . The seller on time and the package very well . Five stars for all .  
1	  I got this as a gift from my uncle a year ago . After 3 months the right side broke . I sent it in for warranty and they shipped me new ones about 3 months later . I received them not too long ago and the headphones are broken yet again . Def not worth the headache even as a gift . I think the sound signature is also very poor . I appreciate bass and I can say that headphones with little bass bother me a bit but these headphones are nothing but rattling in your ear . Heavy on bass and everything else is kind of muffled in comparison with other headphones . Other headphones Ive had ranged from 20 dollar headphones to 160 dollar headphones . If I could recommend a headphone , I would go with the Klipsh s4 , their a better build and are more durable . Ive had those for a year now and no problems what so ever .  
1	  Don't buy this GPS as there are no updates available and Jensen says none will be issued in the future . If you can't update it , it is of no use after a year or so when new roads or streets are created . I have had mine for two years and it is totally unusable because of not being able to update it .  
2	  I bought this as a 9 " digital picture frame and was disappointed and surprised that it measures only 8 " diagonally . I 'm surprised Amazon doesn't note that in the description . Once I got this thing going , I realized that it was a higher quality product than the other frame I have by Pandigital . Although there is no remote , the controls are very easy to operate and intuitive . Probably the best feature is the ability to make albums on your memory card . I 'm using a 2GB card and have made several albums for dogs , kids , vacation home , family etc . Depending on my mood , I can choose a slide show or still to suit . The internal memory stores about 75 pictures but I find I don't even use that . One of the best features , in my opinion , is the built in rechargeable battery . You can move the frame to different spots or pass it around in a group . As far as I can tell the battery lasts about 1 1/2 hours to 2 hrs when doing slide shows . It gives a five minute warning before the battery is exhausted and recharges in a few hours . This frame will not accept SDHC cards and will not play video . I knew that going in but some might be disappointed . The frame 's appearance is impressive . The brushed aluminum has a very rich modern look to it . As far as I can tell , Philips doesn't say what their resolution is but the picture is bright and sharp . My next frame will also be a Philips since I like the built in battery , the build quality , and the album features . This frame may be a tad pricey but I think the battery adds extra value .  
2	  I 've been using this product for a couple of weeks now . I throw it in my gym bag and charge my iPod at work before I go to the gym or charge it on the bathroom sink so I don't forget to take the iPod with me in the morning . Handy little charger and you can't beat the price .  
1	  I have the v5 of this router . I put the latest firmware on it . None of this made any difference to all the tests I discuss below . I am a very experienced software engineer . I just want you to know who was doing these tests . Since my initial testing about 2 weeks ago , I must correct myinitial assessment that the router 's throughput is bad . Actually , it 's very very good . I was having problems with a wireless notebook card . However , the rest of my negativeopinion stands , and I 'd still say " get another router " . If all you want to do is surf the web and read email , this router will work . If you want to do ANYTHING ELSE , run , do not walk , to the store , and get yourself a different router . I 'm in a lab , with perfect Ethernet connections on both the WAN and LAN sides of this router ( no ISP involved ) , and my wirelessly connected computer is sitting feet from the thing , so there 's no " bad signal " issues . Here 's what 's wrong with this thing : 1 . Discovery is awful . Using it in wireless mode : now you see it , now you don't . Discovery by the Windows wireless manager fails a lot . 2 . UPnP doesn't . It times out , locks up , and loses UPnP entries at the drop of a hat . So you can forget chat , messenger , videoconferencing , and any other tools that use the handy UPnP setup to open the port forwarding entries . 3 . Every setting you change in the web interface requires the router to restart and it takes FOREVER ( like 30 seconds ) . 4 . Out of the box , the wireless doesn't work , BY DESIGN . You have to use some obnoxious " configuration " program they include on a CD , or , connect with the WIRED side , and go to the main config web page . 5 . Change the wireless SSID from the default " NETGEAR " and it 's goodbye wireless LAN . You won't be able to connect to it every again , until you connect using the wired side , change the name BACK to " NETGEAR " , reboot , and then change it again to what you want . Then it finally works . 6 . When you change " some " configuration settings , it will spontaneously lose other ones . When you change settings , " sometimes " after it saves them and reboots , you won't be able to find the router again until you power it off and on . You might think it 's just a defective unit . But don't bet on it . Like I said , if you just set it up and use the web and email , it never hiccups - very unlikely if it had a hardware problem . But if you do anything else to it , it 's a total piece of junk . My experience a week ago with support for their older MR814 router led me to NetGear 's useless tech support call center in India ( no , this isn't racist , it 's really in India ) . And what do you get ? 1 ) You have to go through an arduous web page " registration " process before the call center will even help you . 2 ) The web page registration would not work , insisting that the " purchase date " I entered was invalid , even though it 's not . 3 ) The call center person told me they would register my router for me , and that I would have to call back in 20 minutes after the registration had time to get into their database . In short , their tech support is such agony , that I am not going to call them on THIS router . It 's going in the dumpster . I am in the process of reviewing routers for a videoconferencing software product my company sells . Specifically , I 'm looking for ones that support UPnP well , because I want to set up the ports on the router to let video get in without making the user setup the router themself . As a result , I have a big pile of different routers here , and I can tell you that this one is the worst , bar none . Stay away from the D-Link DI-624 too , while you 're at it . The Linksys models I 've tried work the best , by far .  
1	  I used this device for several months . It would randomly drop its connection back to the wireless router it was connecting with . Sure the signal was stronger after i installed the Range Expander , but it was less reliable do to all the dropped connections . And yes , I was using latest firmwarebit the bullet and ran wire directly to the room with the week signal and do not regret the effort . This product is not worth the time or money  
1	  This was my first experience with Amazon . com ; it is misfortunate that my experience was not good one . January of 2010 I bought from you a HP inkjet print cartridge # 15 black . Receiving the cartridge the expiration date was April of 2004 . I am returning the cartridge to you unopened . I want a complete refund including shipping cost .  
2	  Sennheiser RS 140 Wireless Balanced HeadphonesThis product does exactly what they are supposed to do . The audio quality is excellent and have not experienced any interference when moving around . The RS 140 was purchased because of a slight hearing loss and now the TV can be enjoyed at a normal volume without disturbing my husband and I can adjust the headphone volume independently of the TV volume . 2 to 3 hours of TV viewing is not uncomfortable with these headphones .  
2	  I like : 1 . multiple openings for even the kids BIG pencils2 . Doesn't " burn out " after sharpening at least 50 pencils3 . large cup for pencil shavings4 . Can sharpen colored pencilsBummer : It started making a strange sound after about a month . No decrease in performance yet , but maybe it 's coming ?  
2	  when i found this i was amazed it was so cheap . when i got it ( two days later ) and confirmed this awesome find i ordered a couple more ..  
2	  I bought the 1600 Microsoft Points , which ended up being $ 1 cheaper than if I bought them from my Xbox 360 . The code showed up immediately , so in no extra time I saved $ 1 . Plus I didn't have to give my credit card information to Microsoft . Well worth the buy , if you are in need of some Microsoft points .  
1	  Junk . Doesn't work . Get what you pay for and we got nothing for this . Please send us our money back !  
2	  I keep having to buy these because my cat chews through the wire if I leave them out . So , then one pair always turns into a bed-pillow version ( using only 1 ear ) while I watch something laying in bed . Great bass and tidy highs . A noticable difference from the twenty something dollar buds and therefore worth the price difference . I use these mainly for workouts at the gym and riding my motorbike . They fit well under the helmet as their " height " is minimal allowing the helmet to be put on without them getting pushed out of place . Can you please make them without dipping them in catnip please ?  
1	  I really was looking forward to reading this book , however , by page 250 or so , I just wanted it to get to the point so I could put it behind me . The author 's style of writing is intricate and delicate , making for long and eloquent sentences that wound their way into to paragraphs full of promise and drama . The disappointment , however , is how the author failed to make any of these paragraphs tie into anything even resembling a plot . What is sold to the reader on the back of the book as a mystery , is in actuality a muddle of characters , plots and subplots that have absolutely nothing to do with one another and failed to fully mature . I wasted so much time on plodding through this morass , that by the time I finally reached the wretched , anti-climatic end , I immediately threw the book away in frustration and disappointment . I didn't even feel it was worth of inclusion into my personal library . What a shame .  
1	  I purchased 3 cartridges for samsung 2010 and 2 of them worked just fine . The 3rd one is still sitting in my room as it would not pull the paper through the machine . I contacted Plex Supply and they told me to deal with Amazon and whatever their return policy was . PlexSupply could care less that their product did not work .. So , the product works fine .. when it works . I just purchased two more from another company and I will let you know what i find out .  
1	  As my title says , " You pay for what you get . " The case can carry my ipod , but I cannot do anything on my ipod touch while in the case , so each time I need to select a song or adjust the volume I have to remove it from the case every time . ( very hassling indeed ) Did I say you pay for what you get ?  
2	  I really like this little remote control that gives you opportunity to lock your Vibez and still have the access to manipulate sound , forward and backward , going to the next song etc . You just need to select either album or playlist with several records so you can go thru them . It 's especcially useful for workout . It 's really small ( see description ) and it has a little clip so it can be attached to whatever you have on you . Having two earphone outputs will be helpful on a long flight or anywere if you want to share your music . The reason for 4 stars is that the cord is a little bit too thin so I 'm afraid that it will not last for too long . But I wll try to be careful . Also when you plug into your Vibez you have to wiggle sometimes a little to get the sound working . Still I recommend it because of the usefullness . BTY , I tried it with IPOD Nano - didn't work !  
1	  I would not buy this if you are looking for a belt clip when you exercise . It came with no directions on how to put on the skin or the belt clip . There is no protector for the screen if it falls . Belt clip fell off first time when I went to use it . ( Never able to use again since it was white and I was snowshoeing ) . I am looking into other products that Sansa recommends for thisplayer . The skin is fine for just sitting and listening to player .  
1	  This is a very useful product - if you like making $ 3 coasters . I was in need of an external DVD writer , and purchased this product in part based on Iomega 's experience and reputation in the portable device space . I am a network engineer by trade , so needless to say I am somewhat resourceful in troubleshooting P.C. hardware and O / S issues . I have try have tried to create NTSC DVDs from projects created using the Sonic MyDVD software that is bundled with the device , as well as Intervideo WinDVD Creator , using several different PCs running both Windows 2000 and XP ( fully patched ) . So far I have been able to create exactly ONE usable DVD in approximately 15 attempts . The problem is roughly the same each time - the software locks at the end of the burn phase . And , in typical device with bundled software fashion , neither Iomega or Sonic 's online tech support offers advice or even recognition of an issue . If you still want to roll the dice with this thing , my advice would be to purchase from somewhere where you have had good experience with the return policy .  
2	  I 'm almost positive I could have used a less intense form of SD card for my digital camera and been quite happy , but with the great reputation of SanDisk , the quick write time , and the unbelievable price ( $ 30 ) , buying this card was an easy choice .  
2	  I would highly recoomend this product . My dell e1505 had some serious issues when it came to running vista with 1 gb of ram , but the second I upgraded it started running a hundred times better with just the extra gb of ram . Ya ! No more white screen of death !  
1	  My husband spent over $ 200 on this frame as a gift for me less than 2 years ago . Unfortunately the warranty is only 1 year . The screen started going black - it will power on but shut off after several seconds . I did the online troubleshooting and also called tech support . Kodak will give you 25 % off of a new one , or you can pay $ 150 to have this one repaired . You have to register with them and give them your email to receive the 25 % off coupon , and you must give them a physical address . No PO Boxes . Kind of a pain for those of us who have no mail to our homes ( rural ) - and must go to a PO Box . I gave them my physical address - hoping that the email works . It was a nice digital frame - larger than others at the time , but over the last few years much larger ones have come out that were considerably less expensive . Totally not worth the price of this item considering the features and functionality ! The Kodak brand name is not worth it on this item . Perhaps they have upgraded and upped their quality on their newer frames . I got the wireless to work - it showed up as a separate item on my network and I was able to view it as another drive . HOWEVER - this feature is totally useless if you don't want to keep your computer on all the time . It 's ok though if you are having a dinner party and want to showcase certain folders or photo 's during a specific event or function at your home . We ended up just running it off of a card the whole time and not switching the photo 's very often - so that was kind of lame . I also liked that it had a remote . Too bad it has to go in the trash . Over $ 200 down the tube !  
1	  This item was a " deal " with the purchase of a ROKU . Poor quality cable not worth the money . Not shielded , lots of interference on equipment .  
1	  From the 10 burns , 6 of the disc were bad . Must have been a bad batch of blanks .  
2	  I ordered P362 and the seller shipped P363 , which is functionally the same but with a full-faced black grill giving it a more conservation look . Fine for me . These speakers replaced a pair of basic Klipsch Synergy F-10 's as the front pair on a 7.1 system . They deliver balanced sound with more accurate highs ( not as shrill ) and stronger mid-range than the Klipsch . Bass seems about the same . Dialogues in movies are clearer and mid-range is less strained on high volume . Bass is good but for movies , they do not replace a sub . I mistakenly watched Tron Legacy on two-channel and the bass was badly distorted out of the P363 's . Switching back to surround sound made me realize how much the sub was necessary . Overall , I would recommend these speakers to anyone of a budget , as I am . From my limited experience and reading many reviews , I think there are no finer sounder speakers at this price .  
2	  I did the trade-in after my 3.0 mp Kodak [ can't remember the model ] got damaged in my bag . This was 2005 . The trade-in got me 2 more mp and worked the same way . I have the same complaint about the rotating switch-very easily turned on by mistake . Rechargeable AA 's were my choice from the start , and I typically carried 6 batteries with me and several SD cards on excursions . I have been very pleased with the quality of the pictures . I recently uploaded several videos of a luna moth my daughter found . The stills yielded many nice close-ups , but I think for this quality of camera , they were above and beyond what it is capable of , as far as very close pictures . The manual said something like arm 's length for the flower setting . For a 4- to 5- inch moth , pretty good ! The videos are not as high resolution as the close-up pix were [ you can see them on the DanniStories Channel on YouTube ] . But , they are VGA .. adequate for YouTube . The battery door is easy for my daughter to open and hard for my arthritic hands , but you don't want it popping open . Changing sets of batteries and SD cards was a breeze . I take a lot of video , but hundreds of stills daily on trips . I don't travel often , but I like to have a camera ready . My camera has always had the problem detecting the batteries .. sometimes I have to rotate the switch on and off several times before it is ready to shoot , and at first , it fooled me into thinking I just had dead rechargeables . Now it is having the problem more and more frequently . I have no experience with SLR 's and a bit of experience with 35mm simple cameras before I went digital in 2000 . Since going digital , I take as many pictures as my hard drive will hold . This camera has been a good experience , despite the problems . I have missed some shots , but had very good timing mostly , to get the shots I want for the family album . Kodak overall outdid my little HP C200 , but the tech was better . HP is a bit on the blue side still with the webcams on my computers . Kodak color is fantastic . My first Kodak got a dent in the lens outer casing and would not retract any more . I should have put it in a case . This Kodak , despite the problems , gave me pictures that I liked . But , I would like to get higher resolution for close ups and better tech . I don't know if I will go Kodak or Canon this time . I am amazed at how far the tech has come , and I am hoping I can find a camera that will last this long . I think it is pretty unusual from the other years-later reviews that mine lasted , and I would not recommend buying it used . Kodak Easyshare C340 5 MP Digital Camera with 3xOptical Zoom  
2	  I don't think this ink requires any comments . Its genuine from Epson , period . It 's perfect for the Epson printer it 's designed for . I don't have a problem using third-party inks on my cheap everyday printers . But for professional quality jobs on a pretty expensive ( at least when we bought it a few years ago ) Epson Photo R1800 - genuine ink is the only way to go .  
1	  If you are looking for an IPod alarm system this is your machine . The reviewer comments about good sound quality are on the mark . But it has one serious design flaw at least for how I wanted to use it and I 'm returning mine . I thought it was a dual IPod / Radio alarm system , as advertised . It is not . The radio alarm is only a second alarm , apparently for a second sleeper . You cannot select between the two options . Tried the work around of setting the second alarm to go off first but you can't not set Ipod alarm so when it ( or the buzzer ) goes off it shuts down the radio . Can't understand why they couldn't have worked around this issue but beware if you want choice and flexibility in what you wake to .  
2	  First of all , i don't own this camera-i have the nikon d80-but a friend of mine does and i 've been able to compare both side to side . no , the E500 isn't a better camera than the d80 ( wishful thinking ) , but it 's one of the best values in the entry-level dslr market . if you 're thinking about it , consider the following : - do you want something more advanced than a point and shoot , but less than a professional DSLR ? - are you a " prosumer " who will be happy with kit lenses , and is not likely to outlay thousands of dollars on pro glass , at least initially ? - is your budget between $ 500 and $ 1000 ? if the answer is yes , definitely consider this olympus . Compared directly to the d80 , the e500 didn't embarrass itself ( which is saying something ) , and outfitted with the 50mm zuiko prime , takes just as sharp flicks as the Nikon . interestingly , oly 's color system favors yellows and greens , while nikon is big on reds and blues . thus , the same shot taken with the e500 and the d80 looked different . this comes down to personal preference , although i believe you can tweak these settings a bit in menu if it 's a major concern . the plusses to this camera are : - good-to-excellent picture quality . - full manual controls , plus Aperture , Shutter , and Program modes , and various scene options ( landscape , night shot , sports ) - bulb setting for long exposures . - SLR-like feel and ergonomics ; the E500 looks like a " real " SLR , not a toy , and has a nice , solid heft without being too heavy . -a wealth of advanced menu options ( which might be overwhelming for newbies ) . - comes with a 2 lens kit covering 28-300mm film equivalent ( due to 2x conversion factor ) . - more megapixels than nikon d40 / d50 ( 8mp is plenty of pixels for large prints ) ; same MPs as rebel XT ( although MPs don't necessarily equal image quality , despite the fact that that 's what consumers are led to believe ) - takes CF and x-D cards . - has a hot shoe for external flash . - dust reduction system ( which nikon lacks ) . - extremely low noise at ISOs up to 400 ; has auto ISO feature ; can shoot at 1600 ISO if necessary , although you can expect more grain than fine detail at that setting . - 2x conversion factor a boon to telephoto enthusiasts and wildlife shooters , since it effectively doubles your range . pair this with a long telezoom and you 'll be seeing the whites of bird 's eyes . - if you have manual-focus oly film lenses , a digital adapter is available . - the price . it 's already $ 150 less than what my friend paid six months ago , and the price can only drop further . definitely a deal , considering what you 'd spend for a similar body / 2-lens kit from other manufacturers . the minuses are : - not as user friendly as nikon d-series ; complicated menu means steep learning curve for first-time DSLR users and P & S ; converts . reading the manual is a must ! - average burst rate for a DSLR ( Oly claims 2.5 fps , faster than most P & S ; ' s but not as speedy as the nikon D80 or the canon xt 's ) . - at high ISOs-800 and up-superiority of nikon is evident . - only one jog wheel dial ( a sure sign of an entry-level dslr ) . - many functions require fiddling with menu settings ( rather than external controls ) , which can be frustrating when you 're trying to get " the shot . " - no image stabilization feature ( which pentax and sony have , as well as many high-end P & S ; digitals ) . - built-in flash isn't great ( strongly recommend external flash , like Oly FL-36 ) . - kit lenses deliver mediocre low-light performance ; the 14-45 's aperture is a sloth-like 6.3 on the long end , far worse than the 40-150 which is 5.6 maximum fully zoomed out even though it covers a longer range . - 2x mag . factor adversely affects wide-angle capabilities . if you want to go wider than 14mm ( 28mm film equivalent ) , you 're looking at outlaying the price of the camera or more for a wide prime or zoom . here 's the catch : if you want comparable DSLR performance from the oly , you 'll have to pay a pretty penny for higher-quality lenses , which really depends on your faith in oly 's 4/3rds system , which it shares with panasonic and leica . at first , the 4/3rds selection was sparse , but as of 3/10/2007 , olympus has just announced several new zuiko zoom lenses to go with their aftermarket offerings : a 12-60 ( 24-120 equiv . ) , 50-200 ( 100-400 equiv ) and 14-35 ( 28-70 equiv . ) , all with an ultra-quiet motor oly calls " SWD " ( basically serves the same function as sigma 's USM or nikon 's SWM ) and a 70-300 ( 140-600 ( ! ) equiv . ) . this shows they are serious about playing in the dslr arena and should inspire confidence among entry-level users that oly 's commited to its product line . these new lenses aren't cheap , but with wider apertures ( as wide as f / 2.0 ) and quick internal motors , they could rival canon and nikon 's offerings . there 's still no IS / VR equivalent offered , but the pot just got sweeter , especialy for those who don't want to jump on the canikon bandwagon . lens options aside , the E500 is aimed more at the casual user who wants to look like a pro without spending pro dough . More to the point , to really unlock the full potential of this camera , you 're going to have to take some time really learning the functions ( and maybe researching terms like aperture , shutter speed , and iso ) . and of course , by the time you figure out the manual , there will probably be a lot more lenses available . for a P & S ; user who wants to take exhibition-quality shots right out of the box without having to adjust every setting , this isn't the camera for you ( that camera may not exist ) . For a film shooter converting to DSLR , the E500 will deliver adequate-to-very good performance without breaking the bank . for the majority of users who want a high-quality , if not super high-end , camera , with some flexibility as far as options , at a value price , the E500 deserves a long look . However , if budget is your primary concern , i 'd also check out some fixed-lens superzooms , like the Canon S3 IS Pro ( 6mp / 12x zoom ) , and the Panasonic DMC FZ50 ( 10mp / 12x zoom ) , which both have image stabilization , deliver near-DSLR performance , and have most ( but not all ) of the same functionality as the E500 at a lower price - hundreds less , in fact . But if faster frames per second rates and having options like super wide-angle , long telephoto , and lower aperture numbers appeals to you , then you 'll want to go DSLR . if you do get this camera , make sure you get at least a 2GB card with a fast writing speed , which will improve performance and decrease lag time between shots . also , if you have the loot , definitely consider buying the body only , and starting off with one or two of the premium lenses . with the 12-60 and the 70-300 , for instance , it 's possible to cover a focal range from 24-600 with only two lenses .  
1	  This item was suggested for the SeaGate Expansion ( 750GB ) External Drive and it doesn't fit ( too small ) . So if you 're like me , and would like to buy a case for your external .. Make sure it fits !  
2	  No problems , works great ! I love not feeling the pull of a cord while using my mouse .  
1	  I just bought the 14 ' , 25 ' and 50 ' versions of Belkin Cat6 ethernet cable . BUYER BEWARE , they must have recently changed the size of the connector . I 've tried plugging these into computers , switches , routers , and bluray players , and all just barely accept the connector . It appears twice as thick as " normal " , and is so thick that the unlocking tab will not unlock . I had to use a screwdriver to pull the connectors back out . I have Ativa and Cables To Go Cat6 cables , all of which have normal connectors . Hope this review will allow you to avoid equipment damage ! Update : I just bought a blue 75 ' Belkin Cat6 , and connector size is normal . The only bad cables have been yellow - if that has any significance .  
1	  No longer turns on after only 3 years of light use . When it does turn on , the disc drive won't open . Don't waste your money .  
1	  I would have given this TV 4 stars until a few days ago , when the DVD player failed , 10 months after purchase . Sharp will pay for replacement parts but I will have to pay for labor - basically a blank check . It is really rare to find an electronic product nowadays that fails so quickly , and consumer magazines always say to reject extended warranties . I thought I could rely on that famous Japanese quality but now that everything is made in China , I guess not . I think all-in-ones are great space savers and clutter avoiders , but if you get one you sort of have to live in fear of taking the entire thing in for one component failure , and that is what has now happened . I agree with everyone who said the delay between switching channels is annoying . Also , sometimes when switching channels the TV goes completely black , and I have to turn it off and turn it on again . These are not HUGE problems but over time they do make the TV less fun to have around .  
1	  1 . ) run out of battery too fast2 . ) only worked for 1 month .  
2	  The cable was easy to install . It 's what comes after that that gets complicated . All the adjustments for using the cable . But well worth it .  
2	  finally a product that is well thought out , handles all those electric bricks without giving up a socket . I bought two and will buy more . John  
1	  Update : After 6 Months of UseI run my PC about 18 hours / day everyday . It has been running for about 6 month with the fan and it started to make a mild rattling noise after about 5 months of use . It wasn't loud , but definitely audible enough that it was annoying . After 7 months , the rattling has stopped . I 'm not sure if that means it 's about to die , but it definitely is not a good sign of quality control . I 've had cheap sleeve fans run longer then this without making a noise at 2x the RPM . If I had a choice , I would not buy these again . The amount of air blowing is also extremely low as you can actually see the fan blades spinning and barely feel the air on hand when it 's right on top . -I bought it to replace a dead fan in my Thermaltake power supply , which seemed to be a sleeve fan that dried up got stuck . I purchased 3 of them from a seller on here called dealbarn that had it for a good price with low shipping price costing me $ 9.20 / fan . This was a deal for a maglev bearing fan . Pros : The fan has clear fins and looks like it is well made . It comes with screws and an optional 4 pin molex adapter , so if you don't have the 3 pin motherboard connector , you can use the adapter . According to the box , it has 40,000 MTBF , which is lower then what i expected from a maglev bearing . I expected higher MTBF since it only spins at 1000 rpm . The nose level according to the box is 17 dBA . At 1000 + - 10 % , it runs silent and i don't even hear any noise when my ears are next to it . Cons : Because the fan runs so slow , u can almost see the fans rather then it being a blur if it ran at above 1500 rpm . It does not feel like it pushes 44 cfm . i can barely feel the air blowing on my hand next to the fan . I 'm a bit concerned that the fan will not blow enough air on my power supply . I 'll probably replace it with higher rpm fan later . If u need a super quiet PC for audio recording or other audio visual use , then this is probably a good choice . However , if you need something for a gaming rig , even for an avg build , this is probably going to be too slow for rear or front fan . I recommend that you purchase a 1500 rpm or higher fan for most avg build PCs . I don't know how long it will last in the long run , but for my use , if i had to do it again , i probably would not have bought it . The air flow is just too low .  
1	  I bought this cooler among several others , and I found it to be the worst of 5 different coolers in my performance testing . I found that this product resulted in a thermal resistance of approximately 1 Kelvin / Watt . Typical values for coolers in the same price range are . 4 to . 6 K / w , depending on the technology used . Despite the product description , this will not effectively cool your components . There are better budget VGA coolers out there , and if you are looking to overclock , don't even think about buying this product .  
1	  This is extremely hard to set-up ! I still have not been able to use it ( had it for several weeks ) . Charged it as per instructions , but when I try to set it up , it says it can't find the program ( I have Windows XP ) . Have tried many times with no luck . I do not recommend this product . Instructions with it do not work when you follow them .  
1	  Steer away from this unreliable hard drive . Mine lasted about 8 months and was replaced under warranty with a reconditioned drive . That one lasted about 3 month . I was difficult navigating the website and finding an email address to correspond with . When there was a response , I was told too bad , sorry . Never again will I deal with Iomega .  
2	  I 've had this player for a few months now . Overall , I am pleased with it . The software has a few bugs in it but , you figure them out pretty quickly and figure out how to work around them . The player itself has only one problem I 've found . Sometimes if you 're playing a song and decide to switch to another song from your library it won't play it . You just have to press play one more time and it will work . Really not a big deal at all . Also , it transfers songs very quickly . It is definately bigger than an ipod but , the price isn't . I figure it is still very small compared to the books of 600 CD 's I used to carry around . It is definately a good buy any way you look at it .  
1	  For a while it worked okay , same as any other card reader I guess . Then the XD slot started not accepting the card until 9 or 10 retries . Then the Compact Flash slot starting doing the same thing . Now the XD slot has stopped working altogether and the Compact Flash slot only works if I physically hold the card in , applying a fair bit of pressure .  
1	  excited to see small package here and ordered it . after got it , I tried two disc on three different computers , none works on any computer . I am going to return it .  
1	  AD SAY NOTHING ABOUT FOR USE IN AUTO . IF THEYCAME WITH A ( IR ) INFERRED TRANSMITTER THEY WOULD WORKFINE I GUESS . BUT THEY DON'T . SO IF YOU DON'T HAVEA INFERRED UNIT FOR GET THIS ONE . BY THE WAY WE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IR MEANT .  
2	  I 'm an amateur photographer and thought this was great for the price . Had a tiny scratch near the edge . Was just small enough for me to not want to deal with returning it . My dad , who is much more experienced than I am , tells me that it 's a decent filter , though he notes that there are much better ones on the market ( albeit for a higher price ) .  
2	  I 've waited for a year to finally review this lens . I have not had any problems with the focus . I have conducted some focus tests and it 's right on ( I did own another sigma lens with some of the focus issues ) . The lens is very sharp . It 's the perfect focal length for 1.6 type sensors ( as it is designed for ) , if you want that " old 50mm prime feel " . It is my primary prime lens ( I also own the canon 85 1.8 ) . I 've taken thousands of pictures with it and I 'm ready to weigh in . I can compare it to the build and quality of the canon 85 , which I would say is superior to the sigma in terms of overall quality . That said , I love this lens . It comes with an excellent case and hood , and it is very solid ( maybe even too heavy ? ) . If you 're looking for that narrow depth of field , low light crisp , blurry background picture - this is it . Turn your camera to " Av " setting and kiss your flash goodbye ! The sigma 30mm is a solid , crisp , all around winner . Well worth the $ .  
2	  I found these earbuds to be well worth the money that I paid . The sound is of good quality , and the bass response is even better than that . I 've purchased two sets of these buds with no problems as of yet . They are on the delicate side , so don't go throwing ' em around , or doing heavy labor while wearing them . But , if you 're just looking for a good set of earbuds to enjoy some tunes , these will definitely fill the bill .  
2	  For years I 've been trying to take decent photos of my work . This portable light box is so simple and has everything you could need . The price is amazing . Upon ordering , I wasn't sure if it really included the lights and such because it was so inexpensive but it did ! It has the perfect amount of light and the best part of it all is that after my photos are taken , I can pack the whole package up and put it away in my studio . I can't remember when I 've been so pleased with a purchase - I just wish I 'd done it sooner .  
2	  I bought this for a custom computer that I was putting a media card reader in the front drive bay . Card reader fit in to this adapter just fine , and adapter fit perfectly in to my case . It was an NZXT Gamma case . Color and texture fit perfectly and it looks OEM .  
2	  It would be helpful if you included " What 's in the box " as you do in other cameras . It would be helpful if I knew that a battery charger , for instance was included with the camera and what ever else is included . Thanks , - WJH PS I also notice that the S410 is sold at Staples for $ 229.50 .  
1	  If you are trying to connect your laptop or computer to a TV that only has component inputs and no VGA inputs , this cable WILL NOT WORK . I should have read the reviews before I wasted my money on this . You have to buy a transcoder or converter box instead , which will convert the VGA signal to a component signal . Repeat , under almost NO circumstance will this cable let you view your PC or Laptop on a TV screen . SAVE YOUR MONEY ( Or spend $ 150 + on a transcoder / converter box )  
2	  I bought this elsewhere and paid a lot more for it . The unit is very well designed ; fit and finish are excellent ; and it performs well . At higher volumes , there is distortion . If not for that , I 'd rate it 5 stars .  
2	  i got it much lower than the listed price here . ( do a search for hanns-g rebate ) . I got my lcd delievered to me within 2 days . i was at first nervous about the product as i have never heard of this brand before . but this brand surprised me as my haier tv did . first thing first : from me and 100 of other customers who got in on this lcd monitor , none of us had a single dead pixel . high quality control . the lcd does not remotely look goofy as the picture here . the viewing angel on this monitor was better than my viewsonic vx922 , which was 200 bucks more expensive . the text and the color are very truethis thing is bright . i had to turn down the brighnessthis lcd is thinner than any sony or viewsonic lcd . this lcd have speakers . very low level speakers as loud speaker will have magnetic influences but the speaker is perfectly fine for any office lcd to product the exclamation noise from windows xpthings hanns-g needs to improve : stand : if you tap the lcd it will rock back and force . a better stand is needed  
2	  Having owned a Sony remote circa 2000 , I hoped the Harmony would be much better , but I was blown away by how well it works . I installed the software on my laptop , did an inventory of manufactures and model numbers , went online to Logitech 's website and input that info and voila , it 's programed . I use it to do 2 simple things ( simple now ) , watch my Comcast PVR or watch DVD 's . Sounds simple doesn't it . But it wasn't ! To watch the PVR I would have to turn my Panasonic 42PX60 Plasma on with it 's remote , select the input ( HDMI 1 or 2 ) , select the aspect ratio . Then pick up the Comcast remote to turn the PVR on and use it most to change channels . Pick up the remote for my Yamaha surround sound reciever and use it to adjust volume and switch input modes if need . To watch a DVD I would pick up the 4th remote to my Sony DVD player , then the Panasonic and the Yamaha to change inputs . Sound crazy ! Now I simple press either PVR or DVD on my Harmony . That 's it ! Every feature of the individual remotes are available from it . The view screen is large and well lit . It 's very intuitive to move through the menu screens . This the most satisfying piece of techno gear I 've ever had .  
1	  I work in the IT industry and am familiar with the use of and handling of PC hardware and accessories . The 4GB Gigabank was my first experience with mini hard drives , prior to the Gigabank I used flash RAM devices . Pros : Came with a nice little sturdy ballistic nylon keychain case and backup software . The USB plug is adjustable and rotatable for hard to reach USB ports . Cons : Would get extremely hot after sustained hard drive access . Inoperable after only 5.5 months of use ! I am glad that I did not store any vital data on my Gigabank . I took very good care of my Gigabank drive , even went as far as disconnecting it from my system when I did not need it to avoid overheating . One day it worked fine the following week it was dead , used three different PCs and none could " see " the Gigabank anymore . I had no warning , no errors , no odd behavior leading up to the day it gave up the ghost . From now on it 's strictly flash RAM devices for me .  
1	  I received the flash card about two weeks ago . I used it in my canon XSI , which worked as expected initially . After taking about 500 photos , I decided to copy the picture over to my desktop . I 'm not sure what happened , but when I tried to copy the photos to my computer , the files were not readable . I could only retrieved 20 pictures out of the 500 photos I took . I brought this from ChiTek , hopefully they 'll exchange for a new one . Anyhow , relability is questionable for this flash card . I never had a flash card broke on me before .  
1	  This is my first time rating a product I 've purchased on Amazon , and also the first product that just didn't work . This was one of the higher-rated iPod docking stations available , so I invested the $ 70 and got it for Mom for Christmas . The only thing that worked was the radio , and that stopped abruptly after a week . I figure a working radio was worth one star . If I had to do it over , I 'd buy from a physical store so I could return it more easily .  
1	  This combo inkjet fax , copier , scanner has some great features but the print quality underminds them all . Because it has USB connectivity , you can fax from your computer programs . It 's easy to send a fax from a text editor . The copy and scanner features work well for general usage . The problem with the one I purchased is that the print degrades after a very , very short time . Extensive horizontal lines appear in the prints making detailed faxes almost impossible to read . It requires repeat cleanings to clear up this problem , which you can do from the menu if you have 10 minutes and several sheets of paper to spare . For me it 's a major pain to have to clean it as often as it requires . Using the cleaning feature wastes my time . I have also had to request faxes to be resent because the quality was so bad . I seldom have many faxes , so I have no idea how it performs with constant incoming faxes . I suspect it would be a nightmare . This printer needs to be recalled , or at least the ones that work like the one I bought .

2	  Although I haven't purchased a HDTV yet , I needed a combo unit that would fit my current enclosure , function well with my current 32 " Mitsubishi TV and have all the features I 'll need when I do get the new LCD HDTV . Although I 've only watched one DVD and part of a video , I 've been very impressed with this unit . After reading some reviews at Amazon regarding other combo units , I was hesitant to buy one . However , further review of the capabilities of this unit at Panasonic . com really helped . Setup was easier than described in the manual . I had downloaded a . PDF format of the manual at Panasonic . com last week , however I really didn't need to . Setup was that easy . I purchased a Full Screen version DVD I wanted , in order to test the DVD player . Picture and sound were crystal clear . The video I tried was older , but the VCR played it as well as my existing Mitsubishi ( self-cleaning 4-head ) unit . I can't ask for more . I 'll have to try a more current movie next . A note to those with older TV sets . After reading the downloaded manual information , prior to purchase , I had a feeling that this unit might not be completely compatible with my not quite seven year old TV . I was correct . Even after trying both Mitsubishi codes provided , it has most but not all functions . Although it 's a little disappointing , I would gladly buy this unit again just because of all the great things it does do !  
2	  I am using this arm on a 22 inch lcd monitor mounted through a hole on my desk . You can move the monitor up and down and side to side . It works great for my purposes .  
1	  I just wanted to add to the negativity of those who have written before and perhaps save some poor soul the aggro of buying and attempting to use Sony CD-R 's . In a word , they stink . I purchased several spindles , and they have been uniformly bad , with many bad discs in each spindle . Avoid them . A better alternative are the Memorex CD-R 's which contain only one or two bad discs per spindle . Be kind to yourself and don't buy this brand until Sony makes some attempt at quality control .  
2	  I now own several of these lil guys to use on my personal desktop , two personal laptops as well as purchased one for the office and one for my work laptop that goes with me everywhere . In the past I 've usually gone with a Targus model and had done well with those until some recent troubles and even replaced one that ended up failing on me within two months . So , went back to my Microsoft mouse and purchased another . Then another . Now it 's all I have and I couldn't be happier . Fits well in your hand , works flawlessly every time and easy to move and transport as well . I like the freedom of no wires and this lil guy seems to work seemlessly on any surface I 've ever tried . If you are looking for a mouse I would definitely recommend this one to anyone !  
2	  This past Christmas , my wife and I purchased a set of Monster Beats by Dre Solo HD 's for our son . Shortly after he lost his iPod , and he allowed me to borrow them . While in my possession , they broke . I replaced them with another set , but a friend of mine had the Bose TP-1A , and let me listen to them . The sound was absolutely remarkable . I later purchased them from him , and listen to them as much as possible . I have compared them to the Monster Beats , and the beats do not even come close . COMPLETELY SATISFIED !  
1	  I have purchased this model for my company for the last 6 years . The last 6 calculators I have bought have jammed any kind of paper , and broke the calculator in the process . DO NOT BUY THESE ! I assume the quality of parts for these has gone down and the parts are of poor quality and break easily . Take advice from my experience , this calculator will not last .  
2	  My son put this memory card in a full Sansa Fuze and got an error message . I learned that it shouldn't be added to the devise when completely full . After searching online using the error message " Not enough space for music DB , Free 90 MB " , I found the following solution " right click on it in Windows Explorer , and choose Format " . I connected it to my computer , opened the file and did that . It erased the whole devise , and he had to just reload the songs , and now works fine .  
1	  I bought this camera for my husband 2 years ago . Worked fine until recently would not download pictures . I ordered a new battery and it still didn't work . A real dissapointment . Would never recommend it . Sorry  
1	  The advertisement for this detector was that it could filter out traffic Radar . This damn thing goes off my entire drive to work ! I have learned to somewhat ignore it , but one day I am going to ignore it and it 's going to cost me !  
1	  This extender cable plain does not work in true USB 2.0 mode . It is too slow to be used as an interface to a WinRadio . Really too bad that it does not work as advertised .  
2	  The hard drive has great downloading speed - I downloaded 40 GB of songs in just one hour . It 's a great product , and could be hooked up to any computer in no time , however if you 're planning on carrying the hard drive around with you - then this is the wrong hard drive to buy ! It needs its own power supply , as well as it is extremely bulky to put in a bag / briefcase / laptop case ! For portability , buy the ' Freeagent Go ' series .  
2	  So here is my little tale . I began my whole Palm expedition several years ago with a Palm Professional ( yes , back in the day ) . That worked out just fine for the time , but being a gadget junkie , I had to get the Palm V when it came out . And can I say how much better it was ? ! ? Not only did you not have to deal with batteries , but you didn't have the bulk that the Palm Pro had . A few other cool things - the cradle that has a place for your stylus . This may not seem like a big thing until you leave you stylus on your desk and go home and realize that you need it . And I never had any problems with the software . So , as it was I was completely happy with my little , stylish Palm V.Then Handspring came out . And I had to have that - for the MP3 player . So I got rid of the Palm and got on the waiting list for a little iMac colored Handspring . I was super excited - more memory and the cool Springboard feature seemed like it would be nice . What a disappointment I was in for after having owned the Palm V. First of all , my stupid Handspring crashed all the time . Second , it ate batteries like a hog - where the Palm V didn't need batteries because it has the recharable Lithium Ion battery . Third , it is the same bulkiness as the Palm Pro . Fourth , there was no place for the stylus . And last , but definetely not least , the springboard module 's turned out to be a joke - the release dates on them kept slipping . I guess part of my problem is being an early adopter - but I sure did miss my Palm . So I gave in and did what any gadget junkie would do . I sold the Handspring and upgraded to a Palm Vx . And happy happy happy am I.  
2	  Great product with excellent quality and crisp framing . The image quality is very high and possibly better than the SIGMA brother that works at 180mm . Macro photography gets a real improvement through this lens especially when insects are concerned . Actually , the focusing distance is usually more than adequate to keep the photographer rather away from the framed insect so to avoid any disturbances or unwanted interactions . I love it ! Sigma 120-400mm f / 4.5-5.6 AF APO DG OS HSM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras  
1	  My son bought this item and it broke after four months . He sent it in for repairs with no external damage , they sent it back with a couple of dents in the case . With that , they said their damage was not covered by the warranty . NEVER AGAIN WILL I PURCHASE FROM APPLE .  
1	  Sound was great but did not last any longer than cheep ear plugs . The wire connection cut out after only a few weeks of using .  
2	  What can I say ? It 's Jack Bauer 's monocular .. Well , have on con , needed stay still to use it , and this is a little difficult to do , besides that , it 's great monocular .  
1	  I bought this back in FEB ( 7 months ago ) and liked it since it was a spacesaver / combo . I mostly used it for the DVD player since I have been burning my own , but do believe that it is a good VCR also . It has worked great until recently when it started having a problem reading the DVDs . It starts reading a DVD normally but within a minute starts to hesitate and after about another minute ' jumps ' to a new area a minute or so further into the DVD . I can rewind back to almost the point where it jumped , to see what was missed but this happens somewhat frequently and is not a solution . I cleaned the DVD player but this didn't change anything . I haven't had much cooperation from Daewoo support either .. even though I only had 3 months labor on the combo there is a 1 year warrentee on parts , and after speaking to someone about this I understand that Daewoo will replace the unit if they can't fix it . Only problem is I have been unable to speak with a tech except for the 1st call - I 've called back 3 times to the support center and they say someone will call me within 48 hours .. but don't . Good luck .  
1	  I bought these from a local retail store . They sound great . Except when my downstairs neighbor uses her cell phone . A very loud buzzing / beeping occurs at seemingly random intervals . This happens even when the power is off ! I suspect that the cable between the controls and the subwoofer is picking up some kind of interferance .. and that the stupid subwoofer is always powered on . Tired of crawling under the desk a few times a day to unplug these things , I smashed them with a hammer and called it even .  
2	  We own 3 pairs of these speakers ! One pair is above our patio deck for when we sit out for dinner or cocktails . We have one pair aimed out to the backyard for our pool parties . We also have one pair over the driveway for late nite basketball games and the firepit ! They look great and sound AWESOME !  
2	  I bought this thing last year during Thanksgiving . One day I forgot to check my pockets and dropped my jeans with the Cruzer mini inside into the laundry . While moving clothes to the drier , it fell down . I was scared that I had lost all my documents inside . I cleaned it with a towel and plugged it in .. voila .. all documents were intact .. Certainly a great product because of all the transfers we could make without using CDs and for presentations . - Mohan  
1	  I am only writing this review because anyone who buys this particular laptop do so at your own peril . I bought this laptop in 2005 . After a few months it ran so hot it melted my dsl connector . The plastic shriveled up around whatever was inside . I called tech service and they suggested it was somehow my dsl jack . However my power connector was hot enough that it would burn you if you touched it . I called again alerting tech service I considered it a fire hazard .. another oh well . The laptop itself was setting on a cooling pad otherwise it could not sit on your lap . Just after a year I started getting vertical lines on my screen . One at a time . I called again . Now the warranty was up and another OH WELL . Then I started a search only to find out this was a fairly common problem . The solution offered by HP Service was you could buy another monitor $ 200.00 but oh gosh since the problem apparently was the heating up problem those also went belly up because the real issue was not admitted to or ever resolved by HP . People with the problem determined it was the heat melting the chips loose on the video card which caused either the vertical or horizontal lines on the monitor . Had I not had the screen issue the computer itself was kick ass and I loved it . That was the last HP product I purchased because the service was so lousy . That computer when new cost me close to $ 2200 . I bought nothing but HP before that . To bad their loss . Dell is now my product of choice . Today I am connecting that laptop up to make my HDTV internet connected . Hooked to a 46 " HDTV that now will be a DVR back up as well allow me to watch internet programing on my TV . Nice to find something I can help recover the cost of a lousy HP product :)  
2	  Can't go wrong with the best . I tried the cheap stuff last time and I will never use anything but the recommended again . The print quality was not even close to what you get when you use canon ink .  
2	  I am amazed that this player is going for $ 59.99 . Ed Brantley of the DVDBuyingGuide . com gave this a rave review whch can be read at $U$ I will quote Mr. brantly as saying that this DVD player is " a very solid player " That has loads of great features . Well , the DVD drawer is a little weedy for my taste , but the unit still a value for the money , especially in this price range . For an idea of my experience with region free players , my other region free DVD players are the Momitsu DVD-880 and the JVC XV-N310B , which are very good units but cost much more than this player . I want to spread the word that JSK / H & B produces excellent product at fantastic prices .  
2	  Other than the headpiece fitting a little tight , these are a quality set of headphones . Sennheisers are tough to top . I haven't found a worthy adversary yet . If the price is right , you won't be disappointed !  
2	  This product shipped very quickly and it was a great buy . I have not had any problems with this item since my purchase .  
2	  For the price , you cant do any better .. Perfect for low or mid draw amp installs .. Literally everything you need , and fair quality ( great for the price , though ) . Highly recommended for the smaller install and budget minded individual . " Smaller " meaning I probably wouldn't use it for more than 300 watts ( RMS , not peak ) because of the 8 guage power wire . But that goes for any 8 guage wire , not just this product ..  
2	  I got my HipZip a month ago , and I love it . The reasons : 1 ) First & foremost , the PocketZip disc concept is a quantum leap forward for the MP3 market . I would have been very unlikely to buy any MP3 player if I had to shell out [ $ ] for each new memory card . These guys cost [ $ ] apiece . 2 ) Transfers from computer to player are a breeze ; on my Mac it 's just drag-and-drop , and it takes about 5 seconds per song . 3 ) Despite the fact that it has moving parts , it is completely skip-proof . The number one reason I bought this player is for workouts . I leave it on my hip while I run , and it never misses a beat . I 've tried shaking it hard while it 's loading , and I still can't get it to skip . 4 ) Iomega thought of all the little things : nice case ( you never have to take it out ! ) , belt clip , slick-looking design , one-handed controls , nice display screen , equalizer options , lock switch to prevent accidental button-pushing , rechargable battery , auto-off feature . 5 ) If that 's not enough , it even acts as a little PocketZip drive ! Store word processor or spreadsheet files or anything else you want , even on the same disc with a bunch of songs . Good for transfering files between work & home . 6 ) Sound quality is extremely good ( with good headphones ) . Only complaint is that I wish the discs held a little more . However , I 've found that if you rip your CDs at 96K ( considered " near-CD-quality " , but to my ears , the difference from 128K is very slight ) you can get about 53 minutes of music on a disc - enough for most albums ( especially if you cut out the inevitable couple of bad songs ) . As to size , this is one of the larger player on the market , but hey , it still weighs less than 6 ounces - not a problem even for exercising . It 's still about 30 % smaller than my tape Walkman . In the end , which player you buy should depend on what you 're going to do with it & how you use it . For me , it was vital to be able to change music rapidly ; with the HipZip , I just pull out a new disc every time I go to the gym , and I have fresh tunes ! For most uses , this thing should take over the MP3 market .  
1	  I have two of the 605 30gb and the dvr recorder . They work great except if you wish to use the dvr recorder in combination with a motorola cable box - then the dvr does not work as described . This is a known problem discussed on other sites .  
2	  The difference is the ultra low reflection multi-coating used in this filter . It has a very deep " look " to it . Far better than the Sunpak SUN 77 UV - ANA filter I had been using and well worth the extra cost , in my opinion . I do most of my shooting in available light . I got it to protect the front element of my Sigma 50mm F1.4 EX DG HSM lens . The two of them work very very well together !  
2	  i wouldn't compare it with 580ex , ofcouse , but overall , that flash beats any aftermarket flashes .  
1	  I ordered three batteries since the byline says & # 34 ; by Uniden & # 34 ; : & # 34 ; Uniden BT-446 Cordless Phone Battery for Uniden by Uniden & # 34 ; . What I received says & # 34 ; Uniden BT-446 Cordless Phone Battery for Uniden & # 34 ; . The labelling on the batteries is printed on a stuck-on paper label , and each battery pack is packaged in a Saran-Wrap type of material . These batteries appear to be fake . I had ordered two BT-446 batteries in the previous week which were sold by a different Seller . I am totally satisfied with them .. had printing diredtly on the shrink-wrapped plastic encasing the battery pack , and each battery pack was packaged in a sealed static-free plastic bag .  
2	  This All-in-one may be the perfect device for the home , providing excellent print quality , copy speeds that , although aren't blazing , are more than adequate for light-duty copying , an excellent scanner ( with HP 's own , very good scanner software ) and a fax that can send document from the computer , sheet feeder or both . So far we 've been completely impressed by the quality of the machine and the ease-of-use . With its USB interface , hooking it up to our Win XP system was a piece of cake ( and , yes , although other reviewers have mentioned problems with XP , it appears HP has resolved those issues and now provides full XP compatibility with the out of the box drivers ) . I would highly recommend this machine to anyone who needs all of the all-in-one 's capabilities for the home or home office .  
2	  Pros : relatively inexpensive comparativelysounds greatcomfortable even with my big headKeeps outside noise out pretty wellCons : velour earpads can make your head HOToutside of headphones has no noise dampening - anyone nearby can hear what you are listening toI 'm happy with the headphones in spite of the cons - because at pretty much any volume the headphones put out sound through the back of the earpads and anyone nearby can hear . I wish the velour earpads didn't turn my head into a furnace , but all over the ear headphones are bad to some extent , and the velour is more comfortable . People complain about the long cord but I 've come to expect that with high quality headphones and it 's actually beneficial in one scenario so I 'll live with it . If you want great sound at a reasonable price and don't care if anyone else would get bothered by the noise , then these are a great buy .  
2	  The Mega View 566 does alot of great things . I purchased it primarily because it has direct A / V recording capabilities meaning you don't have to necessarily convert videos on your computer and do alot of file fiddling . If you plug this unit directly into a television or tivo , it is exactly as advertisted . You just plug it in , hit record and you 're good to go . DVDs , downloaded DivX movies and even VHS prerecorded flicks can be a different story . Copy protection on DVDs and prerecorded VHS tapes can really get in the way . As stated in an earlier review , though , you can buy the DVD2Go unit to bypass copy protection . I 'll probably be purchasing one of these in the near future . I 'm not a technophobe by any means , but I have had problems with downloaded DivX movies and DVD content that has been ripped to a computer . I haven't been able to figure out how to get the audio and video to sync . Certainly , there is a way to do this effectively . I just haven't wanted to spend the time to learn to do it properly . For me , ripping / downloading files and then spending time converting them is just too much work . My guess is that Personal Video Players will make some strides in the future to make this process easier , but if you really have an itch to get something now , I think the Mega View 566 is as good as any unit out there . Concerning the MP3 player , it 's true that the unit has problems with copy protected songs . All of my songs are ripped directly from CD , though , and it works flawlessly . The audio sounds good and while it may not have some of the snazzy playlist features of an iPod , for general use it 's a great unit with plenty of storage space . I have played around with the FM tuner a little bit and it seems to me that if FM radio is really what you want , just go buy a walkman . The unit does what it says it does , but it 's really just an add on feature . Video quality has been knocked by some reviewers , but if you think about it , you 're watching personal video on a very small screen . Yes , you can see the individual pixels if you look for them , but it 's really not an issue unless you are a videophile . I would think , for most folks , watch it for a couple of minutes and you won't even notice the pixels . Overall , I 'm very pleased with the unit and I would buy it again . I like to watch TV when I 'm going to sleep , but my wife hates having the TV on . I can put in the headphones , use the mini tripod to sit the unit on the night stand and watch whatever I feel like without interrupting her . I primarily use the Mega View as a portable tivo . I tivo all of my favorite sitcoms , movies , etc . and then record them onto the portable unit to watch later . I know this isn't Mega View 's fault , but if there was a built in way to get around the copy protection I would give it 5 stars . It burns a little bit to have to buy another piece of equipment to copy my DVDs over , but that 's what pirates have brought us to . As a side note , I 've noticed that some of my cheap-o DVD 's ( like the ones you buy at Wal Mart for $ 3 of really old movies ) don't have copy protection and work just fine .  
1	  the reviews on here are probably from people who like to pay hundreds of dollars for ink and then have no problem with a broken printer ( or the Canon PR people - they seem to have high ratings on their site too ) . just google all the issues with this thing , if the ink is low it wont print , copy , or scan . Then , when you try all the troubleshooting techniques , Canon basically acknowledges their design flaws . Seriously , I 've never been so upset with a product before . Unless all 5 of your ink cartridges are full , it WILL NOT PRINT , SCAN , FAX , or COPY . If you are low on ink , tough luck . I have a giant paper weight , and I 'm not too enthusiastic about the irony in that .  
1	  Try buying a Delkin RCR-V3 lithium-ion charger and battery . So far , I 've taken about 40 pictures with my Coolpix 3200 , many with flash , and I see no sign of low battery . Lithium-ion batteries do not have a " memory " and also keep a charge and will take more pictures . And , right now , it costs less than the Nikon battery and charger kit . One warning : Technically , if Nikon decides that the battery causes a problem with your camera , it would invalidate the warranty .  
1	  Installed GCS1732 switch with one new HP pavillion p7-1010 usb mouse / keyboard windows 7 home premium and an older computer with XP service pack 3 , MSI mainboard and intel 2.4 ghz processor and ps2 keyboard / mouse . The result is a mouse that works very irratic with both systems . I have had to unplug the usb mouse from the switch and plug a mouse seperatly into each computer . Iogear Technical support seems to be non existant .  
1	  Purchased for my wife about 2.5 years ago . Not a bad little computer-save for about one year after purchasing the speakers quit working-which Sony fixed quickly as it was still under warranty . Then about 6 months ago the DVD combo-drive began to fail . Most recently , ( two weeks ago ) the hard drive has failed completely . ( with some warning , but I was unable to back up some of the data before complete failure ) Bottom line : Wife loved the computer-it was light , small , and had great battery life . However , ours had its share of problems and there are many people who seem to have similar problems with hard drive .  
2	  I just love this little camera . I 've always loved things in miniature and this lovely little thing takes wonderful pics .  
2	  If you are reading this review , you may have already spent hours looking for a mysteriously elusive product : the decent clock radio . Look no further . I spent months searching for clock radio that would fit my ( seemingly simple ) needs . I finally found this one , put it to the test and am impressed with the results . The product is so good that I 'm writing my first-ever review . I hope you find it helpful . Product pros : - numbers are big enough to read without glasses - soft green doesn't illuminate the whole bedroom - dimmer switch available - grad-u-wake feature : the only buzzer I 've experienced that isn't jarring / ugly - small footprint on the nightstand - programmable nap & snooze durations - dual alarms can both be set to radio or buzzer - adequate radio quality - simple , easy , inexpensiveProduct cons : - noneFinally someone got all the features right . See for yourself ! Bonsoir .  
1	  and don't get involved with the Sirius S-50 . It 's a really good concept .. but badly implemented . If you get one , you will be hooked and spend countless hours on the phone with customer service and surfing the internet trying to find solutions to the ultimate problem .. a bad product with bad software . Maybe over time they will have the bugs worked out .. or maybe they will go bankrupt .. but my advice is to wait .  
2	  I got this for photos and video in my Canon 60D . It works great , and the card is fast enough for 1080p 24fps . It 's cheap on Amazon , too ( as usual ) .  
2	  This is my first digital camera bought after researching the web reviews . I took 16 pictures at a 4th of July parade and the results were fantastic . It 's easy to use the default mode and just point and shoot with excellent results of clarity and color saturation . I made 2 4x6 prints on my HP 932 and people couldn't believe these weren't photo lab quality . I tried the software on a Windows 95 computer and couldn't get it to work ( possibly no Windows 95 driver on the disk ) but my Windows ME with USB had no problem with fast downloads .  
2	  THE PRICE IS RIGHT for the value , price and performance . Go to purchase it somewhere else and you will pay more than 10 times the amount for the same thing . The cable works as advertised and I 'm very happy with it . I recommend it to anyone .  
1	  I purchased a FVS 318 on March 2004 . FVS 318 's administrative interface allowed me to change HTTP port forwarded traffic from web server ` A ' to web server ` B ' . However , FVS 318 never implemented these changes I made within the administrative port forwarding interface . FVS 318 continued to forward traffic to web server ` A ' . Nothing short of resetting factory settings would allow me to reconfigure HTTP port forwarding . Not acceptable for a small business . Netgear technical support ( located in India ) was ineffectual . Both support technicians were clueless regarding Web Services , HTTP Headers , and DNS . After 45 minutes I was told the firmware on my recently purchased FVS 318 router was two versions behind the latest 2.4 version . Neither support technician could confirm a firmware upgrade would resolve bugs regarding reconfiguration changes to HTTP port forwarding . Fortunately , once FVS 318 was operating the latest 2.4 version firmware , HTTP port forwarding could easily be modified . I have lost faith in Netgear . Netgear appears to sell products which are not fully quality tested . Given my difficulty with port forwarding , I can only imagine the bugs awaiting my implementation of VPN and / or Network Printing . I choose to spend my money on a Cisco SOHO 90 series router . In the future I will give greater credence ti other customer reviews . ( reviews not written by Netgear representatives )  
2	  I was very pleased with my Belkin purchase . I was focused on a few things , 1 . length to go behind my sofa . 2 . plenty of transformer plug ins and it met both .. I am VERY PLEASED !  
1	  it broke and camera was ruined after about 3 uses ! Sony reimbused camera and gave us money back for cover because it was a known problem .  
2	  This was a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loves it ! Very high quality . Best price on the web .  
2	  I bought this cartridge because black was the first to deplete in my 5 cartridge system . The swap was easy and fast and the printer immediately responded with better quality black printing .  
2	  Love the stereo , plus it has front panel auxiliary and USB ports . the sound and equalizer is also a plus . and for the price its a nice deal !  
1	  But the build quality does not meet my expectations . Firstly , I do like the style ; objects with corners tend to be easier to manipulate when you 're not looking at it . I am far less concerned about style than build quality , however . It feels lighter than you would expect of a box-like design as well . The silver part of the casing is some kind of metal because it conducts heat / cold more than plastic ( metal > plastic ) . It behaves as a pure data flash drive as well as MP3 player ; in fact , I didn't bother to install any software and on my WinXP computer could just drag and drop and use the player immediately . It does not have a case or a holder that prevents it from flapping around if you prefer to run with it ; the combined necklace-earbuds with magnets are brilliant , but the length is not adjustable at all . You could switch to your own headphones and just drop it into a pocket , though . Being able to charge from the same USB transfer cable is convenient and not wasteful-as long as you have regular access to a computer . Under those conditions , I would still be satisfied with it , but the first MP100 I got from Amazon was defective in that the joystick button would not register to the right side ( there should be a tactile ' click ' ) . I have my second MP100 right now from Amazon , but the joystick button only half-registers to the top . While there is still a ' click ' when I raise the volume , I have to gently push the button back downward to center it again . I 'm worried that eventually the joystick will cease to function to the top side now . If you get an MP100 with a perfectly working joystick button , it could be fine for a while . Perhaps I 'm unlucky , but it does seem the main button is the MP100 's primary point of weakness .  
2	  Excellent replacement for laptop . As good as the OEM that was on the laptop . If you need a replacement this one should be perfect .  
1	  I have had this printer for a couple of years . For a while it produced nice prints , although it did have some trouble feeding paper . However the print heads are now clogged and won't print properly even after loading brand new ink cartridges and running multiple cleaning cycles . All printouts have streaks and gaps and I have to print three or four pages just to get one good copy . And get this - every time you run a cleaning cycle on this printer it uses up about 10 % of the ink in EVERY cartridge . It costs about $ 100 to replace all the cartridges , so every time you do a cleaning cycle it costs you $ 10 ! Maybe you will have better luck than I did , but I do not recommend this printer .  
1	  The body is capable of producing great quality , razor sharp images . Sadly the same quality does not extend to the standard 18-55 kit lens , either mechanically or optically . For example .. - The inner lens tube wobbles all over the place , which makes you wonder what is actually holding it in position . - Accurate manual focusing is impossible due to the amazingly poor design and build . - The lens mount is plastic . - The optics are shockingly poor . Don't expect sharp images , esp at the tele end . If you compare the optical performance of this lens to the Nikon std 18-55 kit lens , you could be forgiven for thinking that Canon are having a bit of a laugh . You can make up your own mind if you check out the " Reviews " section of the Photozone site ( comes up via any of the search engines ) . Try opening two web browser sessions and size them down width ways so you can compare the two lenses side by side . I think you 'll be shocked at what you see . So why does Canon ship such a poor lens as standard with this body ? Beats me - its reputation is widely reported in mags and online . The sooner Canon discontinue the std 18-55 lens the better - it 's absolute pap and has no place on a current day DSLR . My recommendation to anyone thinking of buying this camera is to buy the body and choose the lens separately . If you must have a Canon lens then the IS version of the 18-55 is infinitely better than the std ( non-IS ) 18-55 kit lens ( in terms of the image quality it delivers anyway - mechanically it 's not much better ) . Or , if you don't mind going down the third party lens route , you could opt for the Tamron 17-50 F2.8 - a cracking lens that really does justice to the superb quality and design of the body . Which to choose ? The Canon IS 18-55 is cheaper , while the Tamron 17-50 is faster and significantly better in terms of image quality ( sharper into the image corners and sharper at the tele end too ) . Happy hunting . :-)  
1	  Bought in March , Wireless is now cutting in and out . Direct connections work fine-but come on-90 days before the wireless goes . I haven't tried customer support-not sure it 's worth it , last time I had a similar issue took forever for them to tell me to reset the router , update the firmware-and still had the same issues . No more D-LInk for me-I 'll be buying NetGear .  
1	  I had the same problems as everyone else who used this product . I had Version 1 for just under 90 days and worked with Level 1 tech support numerous times to get the thing steady . Tech support seemed to try to keep me trying things until I got to the 90 day point , at which time they seemed like they weren't going to help me . They kept asking me for the date that I bought it . I didn't want to get to the 90-day point , so I demanded a new router at about day 89 . They complied quickly ( no CC needed ) so at least they have that going for them . The original router 's problem wasn't that it rebooted , as other users reported . In my case , it simply didn't allow you to connect to the Internet by either not giving you a DHCP address when you started up or by just bombing out and freezing up at random times . The problem really could happen at any time . Sometimes it worked for 24 hours , sometimes for 2 minutes . You never knew when it was going to freeze up on you . If you power-cycled the router , all was well again . I quickly got a new unit from Netgear ( another V. 1 ) and the same problems quickly appeared . I followed hrd2k 's simple instructions ( set the preamble to long preamble vice automatic ) and now the system is stable for weeks at a time , which is as long as I 've tested it . I 'm satisfied with unit , but they definitely sold it with bugs . Auto 108-mode wouldn't work until a recent s / w update . That meant that the unit would only work in a mixed B and G environment at 54 Megabits . Also , the logs only monitor port 80 and only monitor outbound connections . If someone is using AOL IM or telnet on your system , you can't tell . Hey , if it 's a firewall , I would like to see what 's going out and trying to come in . The log only holds about 40 recent outbound connections , so it you surf for 5 to 10 minutes , the logs are overwritten . You can mail yourself the logs if you want before they 're overwritten , but most people won't care about this . If you want to see what your kids surfed today , they had better have been using port 80 and doing whatever within the past 5 minutes . So , with these kinds of problems and these limitations , why did I rate it a 2 instead of a 1 ? I like the fact that you can restrict access to certain MAC addresses and that the wireless range is better than the MR314 that it replaced . I also like the fact that you can reserve a DHCP address for a particular machine . This is handy for me because one of my machines shares a printer and I have the other network machines find that one by IP address . Anyhow , it 's now a nice unit thanks to hrd2k . I wish Netgear support knew about this fix . Hey , who would have suspected that changing something from automatic would fix it ? Good find , hrd2k , and thanks for publicizing it . You saved me some money by not having to purchase a Linksys or D-Link to replace it .  
1	  The reason I 'm giving this tablet two stars is to call attention to this model 's design flaw , which is the USB cable / port . Although tablets are a great addition to the graphics professional , and one you really can't work w / o , the Intuous USB cable will eventually fail internally ( This happens on the Intuous 4 also ) . It 's simply lacking in quality control . Mine started failing after 2 years and now has completely failed . The Intuous 4 USB port has a similar quality control issue . Everything else about this tablet is 5 stars , but you can't use it w / o the cable . And for quality control issues , it gets a three star reduction . When you buy an Intuous , just be aware that you may be replacing it after a couple of years , and according to searches for " Intuous 4 USB port " , perhaps a year before failure . Edit : 11/24/2011After first writing this review , I disassembled the tablet and resoldered the USB connection . It worked fine until just a few weeks ago . My Intuos 3 has now failed completely as Windows can no longer identify the tablet , even with the Windows 7 generic drivers ( without the Wacom drivers installed ) . I think I got around 2 1/2 years of use out of it . I was just expecting something more quality oriented for an initial cost of around 400 USD .  
2	  Ok , so I was skeptical to say the least , but I have to tell you that this little gadget is by far the easiest , quickest way to make some really good popcorn . My wife and I have been having popcorn pretty much every night since we received it last week . I guess every microwave oven is different , but for us , it takes 1:30 to get the whole thing popped to perfection , though there are like 10 kernels left unpopped , I have found that if I leave it for longer than that , some of the popcorn tends to taste burned or something which is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 . As for the little disks that are needed , we have used 2 so far . The first one I used various combinations of oil , water ( to get the salt to stick ) hot sauce and what not and that disck only lasted like 8 uses , but the other disk has easily been used 15 or so times , and even though it looks dirty , its still working so results will vary . Overall though , a very , very wise choice .  
1	  it worked once then that was it , never to be recharged again went back to original battery that still worked but only for a half hour . took much hassel to return .  
1	  I purchased my SE210s six months ago , sure I was going to get a pair of reasonably high quality earphones . The headphones I got were actually very good . Sound was studio quality crystal but with minimal bass , something I hadn't realised would be missing from the earphones . I put up with the inflexible heavy cable around my neck because it was worth listening to . Six months down the line the production quality is suffering . The plastic casing around the wires have split in numerous areas ( including right next to the earbud itself which leads to uncomfortable listening ) and all the copper wire is now exposed . I should have just bought another pair of $ 40 Sennheisers , would have got a huge bass kick , great clarity and a headphone that lasts longer than six months . If you do not need bass , and are unlikely to use these on a daily basis , I would recommend these . However , if you are planning to listen to an eclectic range of music where bass is important every day , these are not the headphones for you .  
1	  The quality of this sound product is TERRIBLE ! The bass speaker might as well not even be attached because the first volume level pretty much blows it out . I would rather not have sound than use these speakers .  
1	  6 1/2 months and it stopped working completely . I used it about once a month so I got 6 or 7 good uses out of it . I guess that 's not bad for a disposable dvd player that was only $ 40 .. wait .. it doesn't say disposable anywhere on the packaging . Well , it 's been 4 months since I e-mailed customer support but maybe they 're still getting back to me ..  
1	  Pro : Fabulous screen , great form factorCon : Unbelievably annoying fan , unreliable , mediocre build quality ( note : I have the VGN-S260P - same notebook w / Pentium 735 , smaller HD and only DVD-ROM ) Sony is the closest thing the Windows world has to Apple level product design . Unfortunately they always seem to screw it up with a few major flaws . This is the second slim VAIO notebook I have purchased ( 1st was a Z505 ) and it certainly will be the last . The screen is truly awesome , brilliant and high contrast ( although skin tones are not very natural for digital photo editing ) . As a side note , small bright letterbox format screens are surprisingly great for those of us with post 40 year old eyes that need bifocals - you get a lot of real estate yet you don't have to tilt your head back so far to read it . The overall size and weight are great and I find the keyboard and touchpad to be excellent - although I really wish it had an IBM style pointing device . Unfortunately the quality leaves a lot to be desired . The plastic surrounding the keyboard bows up around the power button . I would have returned it for that but every one I looked at had the same problem and one look at the design makes it obvious that warping will occur . Mine also has a bad pixel ( red one always on ) . Worse is the fact that after only a few uses I was on a business trip and needed to get some work done in the hotel - just as I was plugging a USB cable in it clicked off and went completely , totally dead . Sony service told me that they have had a lot of problems with motherboards dying on these . They also told me they had to wipe my disk clean losing all my data - why a dead motherboard requires that is beyond me . To add insult to injury , despite packing it very carefully and inserting a note to please be careful , it returned with a big scratch on the lid . All of that would be forgivable if it wasn't for the most unbelievably annoying fan I have ever experienced . If it is on AC power there is NOTHING you can do to make the fan shut up ( short of a bat ) . Even with the most aggressive power saving settings the fan will run - even when the machine is sitting doing nothing with the screen off ! And it is not just that it runs - it is variable speed and yet it cycles on and off at ~ 10 second intervals , you can't imagine how annoying that is , it would be better if it just would pick a middling speed and stay on . But that is not all , the fan noise is not just the air moving , it is obviously a very cheap motor because the noise is predominantly motor / bearing noise of a character that after a few minutes drives you nuts and makes you want to go out and do something very antisocial . I have a new mini tower desktop ( dual core Pentium ) that sits 2 feet from me yet I can hear this laptop over it even though it is on a docking station at least 6 feet away . The only redeeming aspect is the fact that if you set it to max power saving mode and run it on the battery the fan will actually shut off - as long as you don't do anything more than simple word processing . Unfortunately the performance goes down dramatically but at least you get pretty good battery life . So if you 're going to buy one of these get the big battery and a set of earplugs .  
2	  I read the reviews but I was still hesitant that a cheaply priced pair of headphones would actually sound this amazing . The sound quality is great , I am so impressed .  
2	  It is hard to see much functional difference between this adapater and a less costly Sanyo adapter I also have . Both can operate on 120 or 220 volts , but only have American progs , requiring adapter plugs , but not transformers , for use abroad . But when Canon or Amazon choose to give this away in a package with a camera for little or no extra , grab it .  
1	  The unit works fine for charging my sandisk mp3 player , but I can not get a clear broadcast through any of the available FM frequencies .  
2	  I purchased this flash unit to replace a troublesome canon 580EX flash unit . Metz has been building flash units since at least the 50 's and has generally always been considered a name that means quality photographic lighting . At some point in the past Bogen ( known for their tripods ) swallowed up Metz , these days their reputation is not quite what it was and after this experience I know why . Canon , like other manufacturers does not release hardware protocal specifics for use in other products and therefore any third party flash unit or other item must be reverse engineered to work properly on a canon camera body . The strength of this flash is the built-in mini usb socket that allows firmware updates to be performed at home ( i.e. no more sending the flash into service to reflash the firmware onboard ) this is an attractive feature because canon likes to change things on occasion to frustrate third party product users . I use this flash with my canon 20D , so far it has been able to handle anything I 've thrown at it . When I bought this flash I also purchased a P76 power pack , however , due to Bogen 's poor planning the power cable for the P76 ( that connects the flash to the power package ) will not be available for at least another month , thus making half my purchase unuseable and the whole purchase not useable for the primary purpose I bought it for .. shooting fast sports where I need the flash recharge speeds only available with the external battery package . The flash integrates perfectly , at least with all the functions I tend to use , with my 20D and I 've read reviews that the wireless functions work fine too , even if mixed with canon units and controled by the canon infrared camera mounted wireless unit ( ST-E2 ) . Most third party flash units that even offer the wireless mode are not reported to work well or at all if mixed in with Canon flash units . The controls are fairly simple on this unit , simpler than the 580EX . The back of the flash has an on / off switch and three buttons , the LCD menu controls the flash using combinations of those three buttons . One of the buttons also functions as the test and lights up to indicate flash ready . The only annoying feature I 've run into is that the flash has a continuous tone when the capacitor is charged and ready that also acts as an audible exposure confirmation .. I wish they 'd put an option in the menus to shut that off , I for one find it annoying . The book that comes with the flash is Metz usual top notch-no obvious japanese translation here . I was also kind of surprised to see that the flash is still made in Germany . The flash unit , using AA batteries is fine but I 'm really upset with Bogen that they didn't do a better job of making sure that the power cable for it was available at the same time the flash unit was made available . Most professionals are going to want to use this with a battery pack , it just seems completely dumb to release a professional flash unit for a 5 fps camera like the canons and not also make sure the flash can be powered with an external pack . Metz apparently used to sell everything together as a kit , now it 's all separate and optional . When looking for a cable the V58-50 in the book ( also seen as metz 5850 ) is the correct cable and not the 5376 listed incorrectly on some internet sites . Also be aware that at least as of this writing Amazon does not have the cable available ( I complained to Amazon about that , why sell two of the three pieces needed to make something work , just stupid ) . I wish there was a way to update reviews on amazon but there isn't , I would like to comment here on how well it keeps up with my 20D in full out 5 fps mode but I can't because I can't get a stupid cable to connect the 400.00 battery pack I also bought at the same time I bought this . Last thing that needs mentioning is that unlike the 580 EX canon unit I 've got , this unit needs no batteries installed when it is connected to external power , which if you ask me makes it superior to the 580 right there , you 've got no idea how much the extra weight of four batteries will affect the weight of the camera in a long shooting session . Overal this is a great product other than Bogens stupid handling of the power cable issue . Personally I agree with reviews that say the exposure is better using TTL mode than canon 's own 580 . Canon is due to release the 580EX II in the next few months , it promises a tad more speed and a few other improvements but for now I agree that this unit is at least the equal of canon 's current 580EX . update : Finally got a power cable in july 6 months after I got the flash . It performs well for what I use it for but disappointingly after only a bit of heavy use the flash seems to have a problem . Seeing over / underexposed shots and the display says " zoom err " no matter which lens I put on it . I have read on the internet that others are experiencing the same , getting ready to send it back under warranty service . Version two firmware is out but they don't have it online you have to write and ask for it and they send it to you , very easy to update the firmware , plug in the usb cable ( which also powers it no batteries required ) and let it run a few minutes , worked fine . Love the flash but there are apparently some reliability issues they need to correct . update : Now the flash is well out of warranty , same stuck zoom head issue has occured again , now it will be something like a hundred bucks to fix it . That will make 500 dollars I 'll have it this flash if I fix it again , more if I just buy a new one . Canon 's 580EX II is out but they still don't have a high capacity high voltage power pack ( just a AA powered pack that goes for a few hundred flashes but not really any more speed ) . Pretty disappointing , been looking for plans to try to fix it myself but not finding any . I 've seen a number of posts .. mostly all old about this .. I 'm half hoping it was just the early units having this . Have tried to write to Bogen / Metz get no answers to emails sent on their website . Very aggravating , don't want to shell out for a new one but don't want to lose my investment in the battery pack either .  
2	  Just a note : the current shipping revision of the FA310TX is ' D1 ' ; this revision no longer uses the DEC Tulip chip but instead uses the Lite-On PNIC chip .  
1	  Ordered 2 of these cables and one works as expected . The other passes very low quality signal and won't allow any resolution higher than 800x600 . Needs better quality control .  
2	  Bought it at a retail store . It is essential that it is set at a " clear " channel that is neither occupied or has interference from other channels . Mine is set to 88.7 , I can stand nearly 40 feet away from the radio and still no change in sound . What I did notice is that the quality of the receiver is also critical , they do not all tune in the same , some receivers will " catch " the channel better without even a hiss . Stereo seperation is also a factor . It is easy to setup and reconnect , no external power , no cords , many channels , and very affordable !  
2	  Well , I bought iPod Nano and I have to confess , it is absolutely perfect ! The use of flash-memory was a well-thought decision , and made the Nano look like a toy MP3 player . I live in Brazil and when I showed it to my friends , they didn't believed that such a little thing could play musics and hold up to 2000 5 MP pictures . I was really lucky of not losing them . But , I have to confess too , this thing really scratches ! I was afraid of taking it for a lot of places because of the big risk of making a horrible scratch just in front of the photo you 're showing to your friends . Even a nice case cannot protect your little gadget form the dangers of nowadays . I found myself needing to put mine in a sock and have the utmost care with it . In the other hand , one friend of mine bought the white Nano and till today , there are no scratch problems . And other thing : I don't know if this happens to all iPods or just to mine , but sometimes the Play / Pause button didn't work everytime , and to switch my Nano off , I had to be very patient . Apple should correct this . In the end , I recommend it . But I think you 'd better buy the white Nano if you don't want to live with some incovenient scratches .  
2	  Very good headphone , for a good price . Had this a for a few weeks now , and I use it every night . The Highs are clear and base is crisp . Very comfortable to wear . The reception needs to be adjusted once in a while , but three million electronic devices in my room may have something to to with that . Only one con : No battery charger in base . I just use a couple of rechargeble batteries . AA . Great h  
2	  This thing is truely a powerful capacitor . I have the 20 farad version in my setup and it does help a lot with the dimming of my interior lights . I did not totally eliminate it but it helped a lot . This may be because i have this thing connect to all three of my amps . My other capacitor did not survive trauma . The only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars is because my light still dim at extremely high volumes .  
1	  After calling Customer Service ( generally very helpful ) to install the first Z1420 that I received , we diagnosed an inoperable wireless print server . OK , Lexmark said to keep that one and use it until a replacement arrived . The second installation stalled at the exact same step . Figuring I must be doing something wrong , I called Customer Service again . After going through all sorts of restarts , the CS Rep said that I had a second defective wifi unit ! What sort of error rate would they have for these printers that I got 2 defective ones ? ! ? Since this was a great inconvenience to me , Lexmark said that they would send an " upgraded printer that might also be a scanner " . I thought , " OK , whatever , just get me one that works ! " The ' all-in-one ' that I received next did not have built-in wireless . What kind of an upgrade is that - not having the one feature I bought the printer for ? ! ? Fortunately , when I called Customer Service , the rep quickly agreed that I was sent the wrong type of printer and agreed to send me a wireless all-in-one ( X4530 ) . Well , two days later an X4550 arrived . That one installed fine on my ' base ' desktop computer that is connected to my wireless router , but I had to call Customer Service ( again ) for help installing my laptop . This CS rep was not so friendly , and tried to blame the problem on the amount of RAM on my laptop . While helping me , he also tried to insult my internet connection , but I told him I have a high-speed cable connection , so he gave up on that . I could not accept the RAM explanation , and I told him that there was no way that the low amount of RAM was preventing my laptop from sending a simple document through the air to my wireless router ! After some reconfiguring of some settings , he was able to get the printer working properly . ( Note : Except for the fact that my computer was running slowly as it was apparently still trying to " wake up " and the software incorrectly directing me to use the USB printer cable when installing the laptop , I think I could have installed the laptop without having to call CS . ) So , to sum it up , the printer is wirelessly printing now , both from the base computer and from my laptop . Quality is just fine for school projects , maps , and other household uses . I haven't tried photos yet , but the sample page had a picture that came out OK . I have had quite an ordeal with what I expected to be a simple printer purchase , but Lexmark has done the right thing , and I expect I will be happy with the printer now .  
1	  We liked this product until after a few hours after we got it , it stopped working and froze . The reset button did not work . When searching the net for answers , I found many instances where others had the same problem . It was not Amazons fault but the Creative company who needs to do some tweaking on their product .  
2	  MY HOME IS LOCATED IN A SUBURBAN LOCATION . THERE ARE ELEVATION CHANGES BETWEEN HOUSE AND SOME RADIO STATIONS , THIS ANTENNA HELPED TO SOLVE SOME SERIOUS RECEPTION PROBLEMS . I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER.I WOULD DEFINATELY RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT .  
1	  If you want a nice camera similar to this one .. go for the Z600 it has better features and the overall look of the camera is much better than the z60 . ive seen both .. and the Z600 is alot more attractive .  
2	  In my situation , which is living in a rural area with no cable TV or DSL available , my only option for higher speed Internet is an aircard through my wireless carrier AT & T ; and an extension cable running from my PC to my window for better reception . And since I am also in an area that does not have good consistent coverage , I would lose signal with my old generic extension cable regularly . I 'm glad I found this product and the great customer reviews , so now whenever possible I 'll try and buy Tripp cabling . I had never heard of Tripp until now , but this USB 2.0 extension cable with signal booster leaves my old generic extension cable in the dust . With the generic cable ( which I also bought on Amazon ) , the signal for my aircard was always 1-2 bars , with 1 bar the norm , 2 bars an unexpected surprise . I also had dropped connections very regularly . Immediately upon plugging this Tripp cable in it took my AT & T ; Communications Manager to 4 bars , something I have never seen before . The signal strength indicator consistently stays between 3-4 bars ( normally 4 ) , and I have only noticed one time when signal strength was again down to 2 bars , and only for a few seconds . I can think of no better way to show this product really works and does what it says for my particular situation . I may take some pictures using both cables to show this drastic signal improvement and upload later , but if you are on the fence about this cable , as I was , it is definitely worth the reward . And don't forget , it has a lifetime warranty too ! Update as of 01/25/2013 : My cable stopped working for some reason about a week ago , so I contacted Tripp Lite via email to see my options . When this company says lifetime warranty , they mean it . I haven't got the replacement cable yet , but after providing my Amazon invoice via email to the fine folks at Tripp Lite , they said it should arrive soon , and I am out nothing , no shipping charge and don't have to return the failed cable ; great customer support ! Needless to say , I will be a Tripp Lite customer for quite awhile , even looking at their line of UPS 's for my computer when I need to replace mine . Thank you again Tripp Lite . Update # 2 : I got the replacement cable today , January 31 , 2013 , and it is working great . Tripp Lite stood behind their product , so no question my next UPS will be a Tripp Lite , and any other computer related items Tripp Lite carries will get my business as well . Quality company and customer service !  
1	  It played fine for a week and then it stopped playing sound out of the left speaker . It only plays on one side . Quite annoying when listening to the Beatles or other bands who use each speaker for different sounds instead of one homogeneous sound out of both speakers .  
1	  a ) router is VERY noisy ( if you are planning to put this router in the same room that you sleep - low pitched noise will drive you crazy ) b ) poor range ( I placed router on the second floor - first floor doesn't have a connection . Now the question is WHY did I want the wireless router ? ahh didn't want to bother with wires .. what a bummer ) . c ) if you have 2.4 phone - connection drops immediately and doesn't get restored until you turn off your phone .. d ) and the last little thing - poor admin interface : - little middle window with configuration parameters - admin password cannot be longer than 12 characters ? .. And all of this after 15 min using this device ..  
2	  This is one of the best tv sets i have ever owned and a great buying experiance .  
1	  Indoors it 's fine but for outdoors there is no view finder . YOU CAN'T SEE ANY IMAGE ON THE VEIWING SCREEN IN SUNLIGHT !  
1	  We opened this and went to use it and it would not work . We called Brother to troubleshoot and they said it was the Daisywheel and we needed to buy a new wheel and that it was not a part covered under the warranty even though the machine was brand new and this was first time use . I will be returning this and not buying anohter Brother product if this is the kind of support they offer on thier products . Horrible customer service when we called in the problem .  
1	  I purchased the WRV54G because of the VPN features . I thought that it would be as reliable as the WRT54G , which I was upgrading from . Unfortunately , this router is pretty flakey . Some problems I 've had with it include frequently dropped VPN connections . It will be working one minute , then the next , the connection is lost . ( To fix it , I had to remotely log onto my work 's router and disconnect / reconnect the VPN tunnel . ) In addition to this , it seems to require frequent reboots . The internet connection will just be dropped ( and this is not related to the VPN disconnection problem . ) I will be able to ping the router , but cannot open the http configuration screen . Therefore I am forced to manually turn it off / on . Such a hassle , as the router is located downstairs . We had purchased two of these - one for me , and one for work . They were having just as much trouble as I was . The one at work has subsequently been replaced by the Linksys RV802 and no more problems on their end . FWIW , it 's now being used as an expensive WAP . The product description is very impressive , which is why I bought it , but I cannot recommend this product . It is just too unreliable .  
1	  I bought this hairdryer as I was moving and needed to leave my older one in the house I was moving from . I bought it in advance of the move and it stayed in the box . I have now opened it and hung it on the wall . After I turn it on it shuts itself off fron overheating in less than one minute . I am past the 30 days to return as I didn't open and use it when I got it . It is a piece of junk . Don't buy it . Now I am going to have to lose my money on this piece of crap and buy another one to replace it .  
1	  i BOUGHT TWO OF THESE FOR AVID FISHERMAN FOR CHRISTSMAS GIFTS AND THEY WERE THRILLED TO OPEN THEM HOWEVER NOW THAT THEY TRIED THEM THEY HAVE TOLD ME THEY DO NOT WORK AT ALL FOR ICE FISHING ! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY AND EMBARRASSMENT TO HAVE GIVEN THIS GIFT !  
2	  I love this product ! It has a very clear picture . It is very easy to down load and run !  
2	  I did a lot of research before I finally made the decision on buying an mp3 media player . After all my research , the sansa view seemed like the best bang for my bucks . It holds plenty of music , has a decent battery life , and the video player displays a great image . The only con I have about it is that the only way to charge it is through the sync cable it came with . It is hard for it to get a full charge through your usb port on your computer , but that is easily fixed with the belkin charging kit which is only a little over $ 20 . I recommend getting that if you are planning on buying the view . I would definitely recommend the view to anyone looking for a quality mp3 player at a great price . If you have a larger music library , then I would recommend getting the 16 or 32gb version . Overall , I am very satisfied with my puchase .  
2	  I have a feeling that if A. Rodriguez had to replace his camera after almost 2 months , it probably means that there was something with HIS camera not the actual model . I have this camera and it works perfectly fine and I have no complaints . When the flash loads , it takes at the most 5 seconds to do so ( and just when you take the first picture after turning on your camera , not at any other time ) and when taking a picture , it takes 2 seconds do so at the regular setting . Just tonight I had a " problem " with this camera and I went to HP 's support and troubleshooting at ww . hp . com and they , true to their word , replied in an hour and helped solve the " problem " which turned out to not be a problem at all . He told me how to fix it by changing the ISO Speed , White Balance , and EV Compensation and everything was how it was supposed to be . I definently recommend this camera .  
2	  I spent many weeks researching an LCD TV for the bedroom . I read reviews and demoed many different LCD TV 's $ 1,000 and below and dollar for dollar you cannot beat the Syntax Olevia LT26HVE . This TV has an excellent picture and sound . I hooked up a DirecTV TIVO Series 2- HDVR2 receiver with a standard S-video cable and the picture was a little choppy . I then spent the extra money on a high end S-video with RCA cable from ww . impactacoustics . com and it made a huge improvement in the picture . [ .. ] That also goes for the component video cable I am using for my AIWA DVD player . Do your self a favor and spend the extra $ on good cables . You will not be disappointed .  
2	  Well , I 'm only 23 but I agree that the display is too small , but industry-typical . I actually can't find the manual , and I never read it so I have no idea whether it was useful ! However , the seller I dealt with gave me this hint : This recorder ONLY works with Maxell , TDK or FUJI medias , and the other brands will not work . Who knows why . That might explain the wasted time / CDRs of the other reviewers . I have no idea if it is stated somewhere in the manual , or if it is insider-music-people common knowledge , or what . Personally , I 've only used Maxell CD-Rs and they 've worked just fine , every time . I haven't had to deal with RCA , but the factory warranty is there for reassurance . This machine does the job ( when I use an acceptable brand of media ) and I doubt you 'll find anything closer to a pro-quality recorder at such a good price . I 've had no durability problems . The plastic makes it light and more portable .. Heck , most of my car is plastic anyway !  
2	  Worked perfectly out of the box ! no especial steps required . just put it into your device and that 's it !  
1	  The Iomega Rev 35 GB drive is fine for backing up and archiving files . But it has two shortcomings that make the drive " unacceptable " to me . For one thing , you cannot defragment the Rev cartridges . The Rev 35 drive simply does not show up when you open up Windows ( 2000 ) defragmenter . Also , I purchased Iolo Technologies Search and Recover 2 for recovering and shredding deleted files . S & R2 is a great product but , again , the Rev 35 drive does not appear in the drive list . I have contacted support at both Iomega and Iolo Technologies to no avail . . . Buy a different drive .  
2	  Features are easy simple and the picture and surround sound is a wonder . I bought it at Brands Mart including a 5 yr Warrenty in home and if it can not be repaired in a day in home Brands Mart replaces it with the same or an updated unit . The warrenty was $ 118.00 .  
1	  The order shipped fast .. the product was crap . the box said 05/05 and then someone scratched in 17 so it looked like 05/05/17 pictures were orange cloudy and the corners were cromeI paid 80 $ !  
2	  This is my second time using this keyboard for over five years now and beats the heck of the regular standard keyboard .  
1	  First disc wasn't recognized . 2nd disc unrecognizable postburn3rd disc same as Disc 2 .. pretty bad start .. 1 StarI have a Panasonic DVR and have used Verbatim for years with maybe a random 2-3 discs in 100 failing . Having the first three in a row fail is horrible . Gonna dig one out from the bottom of the stack to sample further down and see if it fails . I 'm sending them back to Amazon if it does . Appears the Verbatim Quality is no more .  
1	  Piece of JUNQUE that does more harm than good ! Decides on its own when to switch to battery anddoes THAT quite often for NO CAUSE . BEWARE !  
1	  This printer is getting rave reviews from both PC Magazine and PC World . That said , there 's a big problem with this printer that neither review mentions : namely , duplex black text printing from ALL applications produces inferior results than when duplexing is off-and uses colour ink to produce black text when printing in duplex mode . Consequently , until this issue is addressed , the MP530 is difficult for me to recommend . Why ? According to Canon technical support , the design flaw is by choice . But more on that later . If I don't duplex print on fast mode , the text looks very good ( the problem is duplex text printing ) . The print quality when duplex text printing looks dotty and washed out . If you turn duplexing off , the text print quality is vastly superior . The difference on fast mode when not duplex printing is quite astounding . Simply using duplex printing makes the text quality significantly worse on fast mode . One might be inclined to believe bad quality from fast mode text printing isn't a big deal ( except that the MP530 is quite capable of producing very good text quality even at fast mode-except when duplexing ) , but this problem also extends to standard printing when duplexing is enabled . That said , in standard mode the problem isn't as pronounced . Basically the MP530 is using the colour inks to produce black text instead of the pigment black ink when printing text in duplex mode . I find this to be extremely bothersome . The problem exists when duplexing text in other printing quality modes , but it 's most apparent or obvious when duplexing text on fast mode . You won't find this issue listed in professional reviews from PCMagazine or PC World , simply because the reviewers probably didn't bother to check . For whatever reason , missing this issue is pretty sloppy . If you want good text quality when duplex printing , it 's best not to use this printer at all : you 're using color ink instead of the black pigment ink-and the text looks vastly inferior as a result . This is from Canon technical support : " The unit was designed to print using " composite black " when duplexing . Composite black is created by using color inks . Unfortunately , we do not have answers as to why Canon USA made this decisions , these decisions are determined by the developers at Canon INC . " Absolutely brutal . Composite black text print is vastly inferior to the text print produced when using the black ink cartridge . Canon technical support is basically telling me that duplex black text printing on the MP830 is horrible by design . Oh , plus you have the added bonus of wasting color ink when printing inferior black text while duplexing . InexcusableUpon inquiring further , this is the reason Canon technical support gives for using color ink to produce black text while duplex printing : " Composite black is least likely to show through the other side of the document , which may occur when using black ink and printing on both sides of the paper . " Then why can I print text on one side , flip the page over manually , print text on the other side , and not experience any issue with ink showing through to the other side ? The text quality looks vastly superior when I do this instead of duplexing ( I do not experience any issues ) . It shouldn't be that difficult to allow a printer driver option to use the pigmented black ink with a longer drying time ( because I 've also been told by Canon pigmented black ink may smear when duplex priting ) if that 's what the customer would prefer , instead of inflicting poor text quality produced by color inks when duplex black text printing . This issue is very easily reproduced : Print text in fast mode with duplexing on . Then print text in fast mode with duplexing off . Night and dayIt 's not just fast mode that 's affected either ; it 's all print quality modes when duplex printing is enabled . More importantly , all customers have the added bonus ( in addition to poor black text quality while duplexing ) of wasting color ink when printing black text with the duplex printing option enabled . Canon 's response to this is that pigmented black ink will smear , bleed , or show through to the other side when duplex printing . Contrary to Canon 's claim , I am not experiencing any issues when printing black text in standard mode on one side of cheap Britex Premier Multiusage paper ( 20 lb 92 bright . . . I paid less than a dollar for 500 sheets on sale ) , flipping the page over manually , and printing the other side again on standard . Regardless of whether I 've tested using tons of different papers ( and I admit I haven't ) , again , it shouldn't be that difficult to allow a printer driver option to use the pigmented black ink with a longer drying time if that 's what the customer would prefer , instead of inflicting poor text quality produced by composite black ( created by using color inks ) when duplexing black text .  
1	  Don't waste your money . Mine broke 2 days after the 1 yr warranty ran out . I never dropped or abused it .. it just froze . I spent hours trying every " fix " available . Nothing worked . Apple support was no help-basically said " tough luck " . The store where it was purchased would do nothing either . This was a very expensive piece of trash . I will never buy another apple product .  
1	  I have returned this product . It did not increase the range of my router at all . I have D-link dual band n router .  
1	  An electronics fan from Castro Valley , CA , has written a thorough review to which I can add very little , except a couple of other negatives : 1 ) I , too , am experiencing audio dropouts , and2 ) It is nothing short of offensive that channels I choose to hide from my custom menu ( e.g. , Gem Shopping Network ) keep coming back . I am guessing they are commercial channels through which Sony and / or DirecTV get some form of payback . As for the audio dropouts , I have had the unit for about 3 mos . and am only now having this problem . It is becoming more frequent , however . As for being subjected to having my deliberately short custom channel list expand daily to include the same channels I have time and again hidden , I couldn't be more angered that I paid over $ 600.00 to become a captive audience to sales channels I would never watch . I have nothing against those channels , but I have everything against not having a choice . This alone is enough to make me never by a Sony product again . The custom list is essentially worthless since it cannot be made to be the default that shows up when you want to see a programming guide . Instead , you have to go through several button pushes to filter through to only the channels you want . Kinda defeats the purpose . When I tried to call Sony , I got a recorded message telling me to call between the hours of 8AM and 8PM . It was during that time span for me . Apparently , they never heard of customers in other time zones . Nothing like truly customer-oriented service !  
2	  Since most of my photography is done indoors , this filter was purchased to protect my much more expensive lens from accidental scratching . The product comes in a nice plastic case with a foam insert , and mine was clean and clear upon arrival . It 's also important that this filter is multi-coated .. just like most nice lenses are . There 's no reason to throw an uncoated junky filter in front of a nice lens with coating !  
2	  Thanks to these cables I was able to connect my new TV receiving NEFLIX movies but using my external speacker . They worked well .  
1	  It is PRINTABLE CD-R however , if you 're like me who 'd like to print on the CD label , you will be HIGHLY disappointed like myself when you find out the shiny surface on the CD-R will NOT allow whatever you print on the label . The ink will COME OFF ! What 's the point of printable CD-R if you can not use your printer to make a professional label ?  
1	  same complaints as the other customers who have windows XP ; this will not work on my computer . Customer service line was a joke .  
1	  I probably printed all of 3 photos and 10 text pages before the initial ink ran out . I then bought all new color cartridges . I printed a sample photo and maybe 2 pages of text . The printer then went unused for a couple of months . After that it would no longer print black . I told it to clean the cartridges and the black would print but horribly badly . When I tried to clean a second time , it told me I was out of ink . What a P.O.S.A color printer and I get 3 photo prints on full cartridges before they are gone !  
1	  When I purchased this product , it was mainly for two reasons : The price combined with the digital tuning feature . I liked that it had the search feature and the preset stations , as opposed to the other cheap armband radios which merely had manual tuning . Well , the digital tuning is great , although somewhat awkward ; I frequently find myself hitting the wrong buttons as I jog / work out due to the tiny buttons . And whoever put the tiny " set station " button next to the other preset station buttons deserves to be smacked around , I find myself accidentally hitting the " set station " button , then screwing up my other presets . I live in Chicago , so there are dozens of radio stations , but I find the reception with the Koss PP257 is slightly below average . I pick up the mega-stations easily , but some of the less powerful ( yet still local ) stations fade in and out as I jog along . And if you 're inside , forget about getting any stations unless your gym / club has good reception ( It hasn't worked at several of the Bally Total Fitness gyms in Chicago ) . I recommend asking people who wear armbands in your gym what kind of reception they 're getting first . My summary , I recommend for outdoor fitness if you 're looking for an affordable armband radio . Do more research for indoor gyms or you 're throwing your money away .  
2	  Item as described . Received my shipment super fast . Would do business with again . Can't beat the low ptices . Beats paying $ 25 or more for same item  
1	  This is a nice radio , but the CD player did not work in the first one we received ( as a Christmas present ) ; we went through the process of getting it replaced , hooked up the new one , and the CD player in that one did not work either . This thing stinks . D7k777  
1	  I have an Xbox 360 black wireless controller that I use to play games for windows on my laptop . This thing absolutely will not work as a charger . I wound up getting two of them . One came with a debunked battery that doesn't work . Neither of them will light up the red charge led on the controller . I have been able to play with one of them plugged in , but that kind of defeats the purpose of buying a wireless controller . Before you ask , yes I do have the Microsoft wireless receiver for windows , and my controler and batery do work with my friends play and charge kit .  
2	  This is the second one of these Samsung MP3 players that we purchased . I bought the first one and when my husband heard how well it sounded , he wanted one for listening to music in his shop . We were looking for something with great sound , light weight , easy to operate , and would not cost a fortune as we only wanted something for listening to music while walking or working in the shop . This little MP3 player fills the bill . Was much more than expected .  
1	  I have purchased the card for my 3 years old Toshiba laptop , which has a wireless card ( b ) so I thought it is time to go faster . I have connected to various access points with it , but for the first week I could not get it to connect to internet , so it would see the networks but it would not connect at all . After installing the latest driver i connected to internet , however even it shows a stronger signal than my laptop 's card it is very very slow . Plus , it did not see some of the networks , which i could see with my laptop 's card . The Tech . guys have been very kind , but their advice did not help . I am very disappointed .  
1	  I just got these . I can't really attest to how good they sound b / c for the life of me I cannot get them to stay in my ears . I have very small ears and these are just uncomfortable - I am quite used to inside-ear-canal buds . Neither the silicone nor rubber smallest tips fit ( the smallest rubber tips are larger than the medium size Sony gives you ) , and I can sort of get the foam plugs to work , but they are exceedingly uncomfortable and my ears ache after a little while - plus I think they would quickly just get dirty , not just from ears / sweat but from having to handle them so much . Maybe you get used to them ? These do not block noise for me at all , but I can't get them to fit . When I press them deeper into my ears ( the only way I can get the buds to stay where they are supposed to ) the sound is nice and clean . Less base-heavy that the similarly priced Bose ; although I personally like the option of turning down base . There seems to be a bit of noise / distortion when turned up very high but nobody should be listening that loudly w / these either . I was happier with my $ 35 buds , although they had cheap , short-lasting wire . I am no audiophile , but I like good sound and I would be very , very upset if I paid full price for these . I 'm still feeling a bit ripped off for the $ 60 I paid . I guess I will try contacting Shure b / f I return them .  
1	  This thing is tuff , but you have to have to struggle to get it on , since it is made of rubber . It is make pretty cheap as well . No way it is worth $ 30 . And it is even harder to get it off . If you have some sort of base station or charger ( I have a pair of Logitech mm50 speakers ) , you cant plug it in with the skin on , you have to take it off . Only buy this if you plan on never hooking it up to a pair of speakers . Mine just sits on my desk , since I dont want to take it off and put it on every time I want to plug it into my speakers . Buy a thinner skin , this one is way too thick .  
2	  I recently upgraded my stock Hewlett Packard Pavillion 9895 speakers to the Yamaha YSTMS50W 80-Watt 3-Piece Subwoofer / Satellite Computer Speakers . First and foremost , let me tell you one thing : wow , and I really mean WOW , what a great set of computer speakers ! Understand : you don't get full blown surround sound with these speakers - few PC applications necessitate this type of audio quality anyway . But unlike the higher end 5.1 and 6.1 speakers on the market today , these speakers will , out of the box , work with and optimize the performance of most stock sound cards . And this is important if you want to get superior performance at a reasonable cost . My only complaint ( and it is an exeedingly * small * one ) is that the audio controls are split between one satellite speaker ( volume and on / off ) and the sub woofer ( base volume ) - it would be more convenient to have all audio controls on one unit ( i.e. on a satellite speaker ) . But I can more than live with this almost negligible inconvenience to get the type of sound that these speakers deliver for the price . Net / net : 1 ) Awesome ( I would even say unsurpassed ) sound quality to cost ratio2 ) Extremely easy set-up ( took me less than 10 minutes - and this included carrying the box up the stairs to my PC room ) 3 ) Wished the connecting wires were longer ( the ones that came with my unit restrict satellite speaker placement to within 5 feet of the sub-woofer ) 4 ) Needs some industrial design tweaks ( i.e. audio controls should all be in one place ) 5 ) Rich base , sweet high-ends , and earth shaking volume for you hard rockers or gamers6 ) MUST HAVE FOR ANY AUDIOPHILE WHO IS ON A BUDGET  
1	  Sony DNF430 MP3 / ATRAC CD Walkman Portable Compact Disc Player with AM / FM / TV / Weather Digital TunerI bought this to play audio CDs and listen occasionally to the radio based on star ratings . After a lot of fooling around I was able to get the volume control to work about half the time . The radio works and it plays CDs . None of the menu and various setup features are accessible . The instructions are useless ; it 's all by trial and error , mostly error . There is a toggle switch that seems to be central to the operation , but it is largely unresponsive . Working it several times usually results in a volume adjustment , but other times it switches away to unbidden modes . This gadget has endless features with impenetrable secret codes required to use them . I would certainly never buy this model again . There must be better products on the market .  
1	  I don't have this particular device , but I intend this as a public service to anyone purchasing any " GoVideo " products . I 've owned two GoVideo products in my life ; one of the first dual VCRs they introduced and a portable DVD player . Within months of purchasing the DualDeck recorder , it developed a nasty habit of failing to eject tapes . I would literally have to remove the back panel of the deck to remove tapes . I kept it , and used it like that , at one point simply leaving the deck open , until it finally failed completely 10 years later , still 5 years short of the Quasar VCR I purchase 10 years before the GoVideo device . Do the math . More recently , and more inline with this forum , my dad gave my son a GoVideo portable DVD player , model GVP-5850 . Within 6-months of very , non-continuous use ( we have a player in the van ) , it no longer loads DVD 's . I think my son watched a grand total of four movies on it before it failed . Maybe others have had more luck with GoVideo products than I , and if so , congratulations . But for those considering a GoVideo purchase , keep your receipt , register the product , and pay close attention to the warranty period . You might also consider an extended warranty , if offered .  
2	  A80 is a great digital camera . From other reviews , you might have read its great features . I would like to address some issues that were mentioned in other reviews : 1 . Weight and Size : Depending on which digital camera you used before : if you used a heavy one before , this one is as light as a feather . But , if you used a " credit card sized " one , this A80 will be big and heavy . A80 is not very light , but not heavy at all . It fits nicely in a lady 's palm . It will not fit into a shirt pocket . What 'd you expect for a 4 Megapix camera ? 2 . Speed : Not as fast as a SLR , but among the fastest group in digital cameras . It can be easily controled .. another plus . 3 . Media : Compact Flash is the mainstream . Olympus uses XD . There is hardly any card readers for XD media . Although Olympus also produces great cameras , I don't want to touch XD since I 'll also be using CF for my PDA and MP3 players . 4 . Power saving function : A70 has a bad function : the power saving function cannot be controled by the user . If you turn on the camera and not use it for a while , it will turn off automatically . A80 corrected this by putting in another function for you to turn the power saving on ( not off ! ) . You will never have to worry about it .  
2	  1 I use them with canon Pixma ip15002 For regular paper printing these are good value for money . 3 For photo printing the colors are not accurate and tend to bleed ( thats why 4 stars instead of 5 ) 4 Would definitely recommended them5 So far I have used 8 Black and 3 color cartridges and all of them worked just great  
1	  A productivity killer . I cannot count the minutes I 've pissed away trying to get this thing out of a state whereby Caps Lock is seemingly on . Not to mention the cumulative seconds waiting for it to switch from one machine to the other . Thankfully , I didn't buy this thing , but inherited it from my boss . This is what ulcers are made of .  
2	  Very Happy with this purchase . I was a gold box special and one can never have to many power strips .  
2	  It 's been almost 4 years since I bought the Zen Xtra and it 's still the only HD based mp3 player I 've used ( I have a Sansa m230 that I use when I run ) . I 've never had to return it or get it repaired and it still works great . The ONLY flaw I 've had with this player is if I jostle it too hard it will shut itself off and upon powering it on it will display the " Reorganizing the music library " message ( I forget exactly what it says ) and when its finished ( takes about 3 minutes for having 25gb + music ) doing that it will resume where it left off . So that 's my long-term experience with this player . It was also way cheaper than the Ipod at the same capacity when I bought it so I 'm one satisfied customer . ;)  
1	  I bought this for my sister as a Christmas present . It worked for 2 hours and then would not work after that . We did everything all over again ( from the instructions ) on how to reset the docking station . It wouldn't even turn back on . Very disappointed in this product - would not recommend it at all !  
1	  mine came defective . the back cover did not close when the card was inside . the front cover was too loose . but also the computer does not recognize it and disconnects it .  
2	  The cord is of medium quality but what more could you want . Works great no problems .  
2	  I have a very old ( 2002 ) 20 gig iPod and a 4 gig mini . I was in the market for something to go with me on training runs with a flash drive , versus the hard drive in my other iPods . I love the Nano - was wavering between the 4G and 8G , but I am very happy that I went with the 8G . This Nano works seamlessly with the Nike attachment , and has provided much enjoyment during long runs . Very pleased with this purchase !  
1	  I bought this case a week ago for Canon SD 1100IS and took it on a family vacation with kids . I dropped the case with camera in it and it did protect the camera well . However , a 2 days after this incident the zipper broke . A sturdier zipper is warranted to make this a perfect case .  
1	  This cable stopped working after I plugged it in to test it , once . I used it to attach a mobile mic to my camera . however , after putting it away after the first test , it started making a very loud humming noise . So loud nothing else but yells could be heard . Don't buy , too many people had the same experience for this one to be a single lemon . Go with a different brand .  
2	  I wanted to improve my Pioneer head unit 's sound without an amplifier , well , with a pair of these little subs , sound is better even more than i xpected , they do an excelent job !  
2	  Iv had this set for well over a year now . First off ima agree with a lot of the people that gave bad reviews due to its super punchy loud bass . The bass is indeed very loud even when you turn the bass knob all the way down . All this really means tho is that you just have to know how to set the system up properly and find good placement for the speakers . These kind of systems that have subs like this are ment for the sub to be placed on the floor or be tucked away somewhere . once you do that then the bass will even out much better and you will have a cleaner look since you dont got a big black box on your desk or table . Please peeps , the sub on this system is not ment to sit on your desk or table top XD .. I have my sub under my desk and to the rear but up off of the floor touching the underside of the desk top so where i sit , the sub is out of site and no it does not vibrate tho whole desk XD .. This system sounds great for games , music , or movies tho my wife and i mainly use it for music and games . It defiantly has the ability to submerge you into the music and makes large fight scenes sound epic ! . Logitech knows how to make great pc peripherals and the x-230 is proof of that . Just remember that part of a great sound system is a good setup and speaker placement . Even a Bose system can sound like crap if not setup properly .  
1	  I called the 800 number for customer service center . The representative said that the machine does not print the total even though in the instructions it shows it printing . In the Easy 1-2-3 Set up it tells you how to switch the machine to begin printing the total , but the rep . said the machine does not print the total . Sorry about your luck .  
1	  Do not waste your time and money . My unit will not even turn on . It is 14 months old and has been nothing but trouble ,  
2	  The flash on my Nikon D40 stopped working for some reason , which seems to be a common problem for owners of this particular model . Between buying an external flash for the D40 or buying a new SLR altogether , I opted for the former . The flash works simply and easily , and is much brighter than the camera 's built-in flash ever was . The pictures turn out better as well . Thankfully it works really well , since having this flash prevented me from having to buy another SLR . Considering a new camera with new lenses and other miscellaneous equipment could have run into the thousands , the cost of this flash ( just over $ 100 in total ) was well worth it for me . I 'd recommend this flash to anyone whose D40 is having flash problems .  
2	  I myself bought this case for my Canon SD630 , fits perfectly . I couldn't find any nice looking camera case for my Canon and this sony case was absolutely wonderful !  
1	  After getting my 1080p LCD tv I wanted an upconvert DVD player . So I ordered this product ( I 've always had good luck with Phillips products ) , but I had my first bad experience . When I would try to upconvert I kept getting a onscreen message from the DVD player saying that my TV wasn't compatible , but after double checking the specs with my TV and this DVD player , they should have been compatible . After hours of frustration , I returned this unit . I 'm not sure if I got a bad unit , or if there is a compatibility problem with other LCD TVs . Good luck .  
2	  Not much to say - I bought the battery , installed it in my device , ( which was in this case a pulse monitor , ) and it works fine - just as I 'd expect from a Sony .  
2	  The only thing bothers me is the limited memory : 2M only . Other than that , I love it .  
2	  We have used these drives in all of our office locations and have found them to be reliable , and good looking too ! Having the USB and Firewire connection is also a real plus .  
2	  After having used both a an FM Transmitter ( bad ) and a cassette adapter ( tolerable ) , the Scosche FM-MOD01 was everything I had hoped for ! It takes a little effort and know-how to install but the result is WELL worth it ! And the fact that it 's under $ 20.00 was just icing on the cake !  
1	  These wireless headphones are easy to set up and fit comfortably . Thats the good news . The bad news is you get to enjoy the ever present company of hiss and pop . Whether you are right in front of the device or ten feet away . I think the only way you could get these to work without the hiss sounds would be returning them and getting normal headphones with longer wires . If wireless is the most important function in your opinion , then your sound quality will suffer , they just dont make good enough technology yet . I will be returning mine .  
2	  I mostly listen to eletronic music - drum and bass , ambiant , jungle , IDM , etc . So the bass of these earphones somehow disappointed me at first . But I tried some other music and slowly discovered the diversity of sounds these earphones are capable to play clearly . For those of you who have bought this product and hated it , listen to Brian Eno 's " Music For The Airport " with it , you will see why you have spent $ 100 for it .  
2	  Despite the problems I encountered , I do give this product four stars . My problem was I could not turn the Ipod on . I kept getting a folder and an exclamation point symbol when trying to turn on the Ipod mini . I finally found the problem and solution on the Apple support site . Support was very helpful in getting the problem resolved [ had to reformat the Ipod mini ] . Once this was done , no problems whatsoever . The earbuds are not bad at all . I purchased a pair of Sennheiser PXC250 noise cancelling head phones but prefer the earbuds because of size . I 'll use the Sennheiser when I take the plane . Not crazy about the enclosed battery .. Other than that , I really like this Ipod mini .  
1	  I used these for about 8 months , at normal volumes . They have decent sounds . My left speaker started buzzing after 6 months , the companies warranty was expired , so I had to fix them myself .  
1	  Dis one , she no good mon . Last mebe , what ? 3 monts zall . I buy 3 but don buy no mo .  
2	  received this ipod in great conditionhas all the things that i wantedworks great  
2	  It has a great price and killer shipping but the only problem I had was getting a grainy picture I 've check about everything that could be wrong but if you think u know what 's wrong please wright me back thanks  
1	  This DVD player plays all standard movies fine , but it cannot play double-density DVDs . For example , I couldnt get it to even read Any of my Star Trek or 24 television show DVDs , also long movies like Gladiator and Fight Club were not recognized . When I pop in a short 90 minute movie like Road Trip or The Way of The Gun it reads it fine .  
1	  Poorly designed . There is no easy way to keep the case attached to the camera while shooting , if desired . No opening for the safety cord to run through .  
1	  I wish I would have known that this camera does not really work with a Mac . Amazon allowed me to return it with no problems however .  
1	  I loved the look of this camera and the idea that it was 10MP . I hated the photos . Even on a cloudy day .. this camera kept shooting at a shutter speed 40 or 80 which makes for some blurry pictures . In sunlight it was shooting at 120 , which isn't bad but I would have expected it to be 250 . What really made me return this camera was when I shot my 20th photo the camera started to make sizzling sound . It when on for 10 seconds until I popped out the batteries . When I reincerted them , the sound was gone , but what had happened is it fried my 4GB SD / HC card . Geezz . Bought an Olympus FE-280 instead .  
2	  Had this player for a few days . Previously had the Zen Sleek . This is a great model . The screen is unbelievable and the navigation is very easy / clear . They really did a nice job with the touch pad this time . It has a great feel . It also works flawlessly with Yahoo Music Unlimited . My only complaint is that the buttons around the scroll pad are very , very stiff . Perhaps this is unique to my player . But it is a little annoying having to press down so hard .  
1	  Don't waste your money on this product . I bought it because it 's cheap . However it has trouble decoding most DVDs , quits playing CDs about halfway through , and injects static into music . Spend [ amt ] more to buy something from a reputable manufacturer ; you 'll be a lot happier .  
1	  This power adapter does not fit the Canon ZR10 camera . If you have that type of camera do not buy this product because it will NOT WORK ! And like me , you will have to pay for the shipping to your house and to send it back again .  
1	  I purchased this unit after considering alternative such as linksys and hearing that it was the best product in terms of reach for wireless devices . I tried to get the unit going and after running into some random errors ( one of the systems connected via ethernet cable kept getting knocked offline ) i decided to upgrade the firmware w / the patch on the sight . Oops . Once i did that the system went into a state in which it was unreachable ( flashing lights ) . Second unit was sent out to me . Wireless was working great , still having a problem w / a ( different ) connection that kept getting knocked offline . OK , let 's try the firmware upgrade again . Upgraded , 100 % , successful ( so the software said ) . Then , slowly , each machine lost its connection to the web . I looked at the unit and noticed the system lights were not on - the firmware upgrade seemed to put this SECOND system into an unusable state - couldn't reach it in any way , resets didn't work . dead unit # 2 . ( and pls . believe me , this was not user error -i 've been pretty meticulous about it ) . No idea what i 'm going to do next -i suppose i 'll see if 3 's a charm and let you know . After that , i 'm taking suggestions on another brand for this wireless thing !  
1	  Original post : The first time I ordered this remote , when it arrived it didn't work at all . I returned it and re-ordered it when it became available again .. and again it didn't work ! I checked the battery with a battery tester and it was fine , but when you press the button on the remote , you don't see any light being emitted from the sensor . And of course , it doesn't operate the camera ( I have a Nikon D60 ) . UPDATE : See the response by Passante .. for the D60 you need to manually change the release settings so it will respond to the remote . After changing this , it worked like a charm ! Unfortunately , I can't seem to change my rating , but I 'd move it to 5 stars if I could .  
1	  I wish I were able to give -5 stars . No not waste money or time on this useless product . Will not work and support is non-exist . No phone number , only a " we will get back to you " website . Sent 3 messages , no word back . Beware , if you buy junk software and open the package , you cannot return it . $ 50 down the drain .  
1	  I ordered 2 of these 2x1GB memory upgrade kits . They seemed to install easy enough but about 2 weeks after install 1 of my pairs had died on me . Computer could not boot because of it . After swapping some sticks around I was able to isolate the problem to 1 pair of modules . The other is still working ( for now ) .. and while I understand failure happens with everybody .. I will not likely buy PNY memory again as I will go with a more reliable brand .  
1	  If you are considering buying this CD player i urge you to rethink and do not buy it . I bought this CD player for my b-day , .. my family not having a lot of money , this was the only thing i got . I was very excited to get a new CD player since i hadn't had one for a while . Music is a big part of my life . Well , .. this Cd palyer didn't even last me a week ! when i pushed the volume button once .. just once it kept till it reached a volume of 32 , which was the hightest it could go ! UGHH .. and it wouldnt wrk when i tried to skip a song , .. it skipped every song . The only thign i got for my bday was well nothing . i didnt keep the receipt so i coudlnt tkae it back ..  
2	  It 's one GB of RAM , obviously . I desperately needed an upgrade to my computer , so I got this . I had to do a little fiddling with what slot I put the RAM in , so it took about three times as long as it should have . But now it 's in , and now it 's working .  
2	  I 've had this router for over a year and haven't yet had a problem . The DHCP works great .. just plug in a computer and it works . No set up hassles with adding computers to the network , just plug it in and go . i think it was worth every penny . Buy this product if you are looking for a quick and easy network hub with DSL / Cable routing capabilities .  
1	  I have had the projector for 6 months now . Pros : - All-in-one , Video , sound , DVD player . - Comes with bag to carry around - Perfect for small screens in DARK environment . Cons : - DVD that you burnt yourself for backup ( with recompression ) don't play well . Even movies with low re-compression have problems , which shows by broken portions of some frames . - The worst through is the sound problem with self-burnt DVDs . Sometimes , even on low recompression DVDs , the sound is 1 to 2 seconds early . Which makes it a nightmare to watch those movies . - Image quality is average . If you place the projector more than 10ft away from the screen , then the image is not as bright . - The projector generates quite some noise , which the sound of the movie may generally cover , but not always . - VGA input didn't work with my Powerbook G4 , even though the powerbook actually recognized the projector as well as its native definition . In general , i 'm on the average for this projector . 2.5/5 would be my rating .  
2	  not all of the wires were there but i was able to make it work , it puts sound through the speakers and turns the head unit on , what more could you ask for .  
1	  I bought this a year ago at what was then an incredibly low price . My internal data drive crashed about 3 months ago and this saved my life . All my backup data was restored ! Nevertheless , the software is poor . It barely works . It does not reliably delete previous backups , and my Maxtor is now almost full , but shouldn't be . In addition Maxtor has a bad reputation for reliability . I just ordered a Fantom Green Drive to replace it because the Maxtor scares me .  
1	  I always wanted to buy this machine . But it was a disappointment in time to see the photos . She has no differential photos to the light of day and night at times the flash is not triggered . Not when the picture comes out with the filter that you chose . I did not like and do not recommend . If you are looking for a fun buy the camera fisheye that you will not regret if  
1	  Don't know why but mine didn't work for some reason . Too bad , as I was really looking forward to this type of style , especially if you travel allot w / your laptop . Maybe I 'll try again hoping this one was a lemon .  
1	  I went through the return process twice , and they only sent 1 keyboard each time instead of 5 . This listing will NOT get you 5 keyboards !  
2	  Great little photo printer . You can fix & crop images from it 's screen , make wallet sized photos or add Disney borders to your pictures ! The only con is the printer ink . If you go for more than a couple of weeks without using it , you have to do maintenance to get the colors right which can waste the photo paper . Be sure to shake the ink cartridge before use .  
2	  Since this camera works w / PocketPC 2003 , I assumed it would be compatible w / a Toshiba 755 . Apparently it is not because the software installs but my PDA will not recognize the camera , and I have tried all of the troubleshooting solutions . The camera may be defective , but whichever , I regret it because it looks like a good product otherwise . The reply I got from Veo support re the problem : " we think this camera is compatible with Dell Axim X3 , Toshiba e400 , e800 and All hp P / PCs . We haven't tested Toshiba e740 . " Veo offered a full refund on return , but this is a disappointment .  
1	  The Sony MDR-J10 's concept appealed to me for its convenience - we all hate the times when we run and our headphones fall off because , well , there 's nothing to keep them in place when we 're constantly moving . The little loops that go around your ears really do keep the headphone buds in place , and you can bet your bottom dollar that they won't come off when you 're running . After a couple months of usage , though , I found two issues that persisted : ( 1 ) while the loops kept the earbuds near the ear , the earbuds would barely be in the ears - sometimes they 'd just dangle there , and ( 2 ) the earbuds would get really dirty from ear wax , to the point where the ear wax stuck in the ear buds would muffle sound . These issues sound a bit too minor at first , but they really do prevent you from listening to music in the long run . Allow me to explain . ( 1 ) After some time , ear buds don't go in the ear . The rubber loops , after having your headphones around for a while , do bend . It 's only natural , which doesn't make this Sony 's fault ( though , I do wonder if they can propose a solution ) . Because the rubber bends , the ear buds will not go into your ear after a while . They 'll * touch * your ear , maybe , but the point is , the sound will not go directly into your ear . This causes you to raise the volume on your mp3 player as a temporary solution ; however , when you 're running , this solution doesn't really work , as air movement crowds out the sound and all you hear is the wind as you run . If you don't believe me , please try it for yourself . As long as the ear bud is in your ear , sending music into your ear , you will hear the music - but if it 's not sending music into your ear , you 're not going to hear much . ( 2 ) Ear buds get dirty . They do . I tried to fit some of those foam protectors over the earbuds , so I can still hear music but ear wax doesn't get inside them , but the design of the headphones don't allow for such protectors to fit . Actually , you only need to use these headphones a few times before the ear buds get clogged with earwax . That earwax blocks the sound more , leading you to blast the mp3 player really loudly . After a while , you begin looking for alternatives to these headphones . Don't get me wrong - I love the concept behind these headphones , the concept of keeping the buds in place - but these really are inexpensive and they do come with their issues . I 'd say they last 1-2 months before it 's time to buy another pair . If you don't mind needing to buy new MDR-J10 's regularly , then I think you 'll like these headphones . Personally , I did not like them too much . Hope this helps . Feel free to comment / ask questions .  
2	  Seller knew how excited I was to have camera and made sure to delivery in a speedy transaction . I 've used the camera a couple times now , so far so good .  
2	  I just bougth the Linksys wireless G router , so I needed an USB adapter for my desktop , well This one was the perfect solution . It has a great range of reception an the velcro base is perfect to atach to the desktop case . It 's a Great product .  
1	  The sound quality is not good . The scroll dial is not easy to deal with . The volume function is very touchy . It is located in the center dial and it 's also used to " stop " . It 's almost like a " joystick " , so if you are not careful , you are constantly turning unit on and off instead of lowering or raising the volume . I have had many voice recorders , and although I like the ease and capability it has to save on the computer , I like the Sony product much better for sound quality and ease of use .  
2	  I 've used this scanner for many applications . Standardscanning and film scanning . It will do 110 film if youplay with the settings and make a film holder for it .  
2	  I went searching for 4 speakers for my 99 pathfinder . Went to circuit city after they announced the closing , not impressed with the inventory or the price . I found these , installed them with a slight mod . to the speaker mount . They sound great for their size , and yes THEY DO HAVE BASS !  
1	  I wanted to use it as an external drive for my 91gb of music between my mac laptop and my pc . Just to find out you can not do this . You van only have your ipod formated to one-pc or mac-not both . Sound quality is a little worse than my older 30gb video ipod . So I kept my older ipod .  
1	  It 's inexpensive and has a lot of adapters , but what good is it if it doesn't charge ? I purchased the charger with a brand new KLIC 8000 battery for my new Kodak . I put the battery in to be charged and a red light comes on and the green will come on within 30 minutes or so and if I 'm lucky I will get 15 mins of battery time . Last night I left it to charge all night and all day knowing I needed to use it when I got home . Well I got about 6 pictures before the camera shut down again and so I 'm left waiting for another green light to get maybe another picture or 2 . So in the end I 'm going to end paying for the more expensive charger that I should have purchased in the first place because I NEED IT TO WORK ! You get what you pay for .  
2	  It didn't last as long as my other ones have . For the price , it lasted long enough - over a year . Wish they had this is a wider variety of colors though .  
1	  Aplle has lost both battle and the war to Linux and Windows !  
2	  I installed the printer drivers on two PC 's . Enabled file and printer sharing through my network cards . Connected through a linksys router . I was up and running in less then 20 mins . The craftmenship is excellent . Looks better in person then in the pics . Print quality is adjustable to save ink . Nice little unit with easy to use lighted buttons . A printer , scanner and copier all in one for less then $ 80 you cant beat it . Oh .. and dont be fooled into thinking you need to spend the extra money on a more expensive model just becasue they offer a 2 or 3 inch LCD panel , because you dont . Those LCD panels are useless considering you can view and change all the printer settings right from your pc without leaving the comfort of your chair . My only complaint is that they dont supply the USB cable , which I think is totally rediculous . Circut City wanted 30 bucks for the cable , what a rip off , I got it for $ 8 at PC Club . HP does supply a black ink cartridge and a color ink cartridge . They are very easy to install . You have to buy the photo quality ink cartridge seperate . The numbskull from Florida in the previous post that gave this printer a rating of 1 .. well you can tell by his post , he is an idiot and sounds like tech supports worst nightmare . He should just get rid of his computer and go back to using calculaters . I hear they make them solar powered nowadays . This is definitly a 5 star product .  
1	  Thought this was going to be a great deal for the price .. it has very limited volume control . Lowest setting is too quiet , next setting up is too loud . Also , no radio presets . Not worth the money spent , will be returning to store ..  
1	  este producto de pyro ads me salio defectuoso , es una mala compra creo es mejor gastar un poco mas en CANOPUS que en este producto tan malo , muestra pixeleada la imagen y trabado el video entrelazado . que mal  
1	  My unit skipped continuously when playing MP3 cds even when COMPLETELY STATIONARY . Some CDs were more affected than others , but they all skipped no matter what bitrate or CD format . I contacted customer support , but they have yet to reply after almost a week . Some reviewers said that the firmware upgrade fixed their problems with skipping , but it did not work for me . The player seems to be genuinely unupgradeable as Rio claims . The player regarded the upgrade CDs with much interest and spun back and forth for some time , but it had no effect and the player still [ stinks ] . It almost works tolerably well as a simple audio CD player , but I could get a better one .. I got a Koss car kit as some reviewers suggested , but the cigarette adapter did not function either . BEWARE . There are SERIOUS quality control problems with this company .  
1	  Too bad for me that the warranty expires after six ! The product has a defect that tech support admitted to , but I got absolutely no help , mercy or customer service from the Panasonic company . They demanded one third of its original price for me to send it to Texas to have it fixed ! After YEARS of buying Panasonic products , they just lost another customer .  
1	  I 've had my Palm for less than 7 months and I am having battery problems . Having followed their instructions , they are now telling me that my warranty has expired and they are going to charge me [ money ] for telephone support . I really love the features and while it worked I recommended it to anyone who asked . I won't be buying another Palm product as a result of this experience .  
1	  I bought this item and i used only one day and the camera showed me that i need to change , so i put it on a card reader ant it told me that i need to format the card . It sucks a lot . Please don't buy it  
1	  The set I bought was comfortable , produced a nice sound , and passively blocked noise well . ( Here it comes . ) BUUTT these headphones popped and crackled constantly with the two heavy bass test tracks I tried on them . If you 're not going to use them with that kind of audio ( super heavy bass ) then they 'll work fine for you . With that kind of restriction though , they just aren't worth the price .  
2	  I had this DVD player for over two years now and it has never let me down . My previous , cheap DVD player had problems reading scratched DVD 's that I often borrowed from libraries ( the unit would either freeze or I would get a " no disc " message ) , but the Sony played every DVD I used flawlessly . No problems at all with this Sony . I highly recommend this one .  
2	  Ok , just found out that my router , Dlink DIR-615 Hardware Version C1 firmware had problems which could cause Wifi connection problems . The other thing I didn't expect is that the Dlink Wifi / router application software under Tools -> Firmware does NOT poll the internet correctly to check for the latest firmware update , it may or maynot tell you correctly the latest firmware version released as compared to what your router has . To INSURE you have the latest update you have to goto Dlink Home page , choose the correct country , hit the Support Tab , enter in the correct model under " ProducSupport & Download " , Choose the correct Hardware version of the Dlink model , Click on Firmware & then download the latest firmware . Once you download the latest firmware you have to Extract the files ( remember in what directory the extraction was done for the bin file .. firmware file ) , then goto the Dlink router application to Tools , then Firmware , then hit Browse and upload the firmware into the router . When you do this make sure you are on a wired computer NOT a Wifi connected computer . My revision was 3.0 and every time I asked if I had the latest version of firmware through the Dlink Wifi application software which is supplied with the router it stated incorrectly I had the latest firmware . At a lark I went and manually checked the Dlink site and found that I did NOT have the latest firmware . From Rev. 3.0 to Revision 3.13NA there were A LOT of significant bug changes which would effect significantly the reliability of the Wifi connection .  
2	  I bet if you are considering buying the 85mm 1.8 you came across this lens and thought to yourself why is the 85mm 1.2 so much more expensive ? Is it sharper ? Is it that much better ? Not necessarily . This is a specialty lens , and that 's one reason I don't own it ( I also can't afford it , lol ) . Photographers who buy it are aiming for a specific look that 's created with 1.2 aperture . The look this lens creates tends to be very sharp at center and smoothly moves to dreamy blur towards the edges . It 's that very special effect that you see in some of the top fashion photography that photographers seek in this lens . Other than the special effect that the extra stop offers there are few basic differences . The 1.2 produces more contrast and saturated colors , but it isn't anything beyond what you can replicate in Photoshop . On the other hand the 1.8 focuses faster . Also , the 1.2 extra stop accounts for the huge size and weight difference . The 1.2 weight 2.3 pounds ! vs . the 1.8 which weight slightly under 1 pound . I am guessing that due to this weight difference the 1.2 focuses slower ( much heavier and bigger glass ) , but that 's just a guess . Keep in mind that the 1 stop difference in aperture accounts for the stark difference in price . Both lenses are designed differently ( element count for example ) . There are many other lenses that serve as an example of big difference in pricing due to only 1 extra stop . Take for example the 16-35 2.8 and 17-40 4.0 ; one stop difference doubles the price in the case of the first lens . I hope that you found this information helpful in deciding if this great lens is for you or not . As for me , I decided to sacrifice the extra stop in aperture and go with the 85mm 1.8 . It represents a better value for me plus if I ever need a higher aperture I would just buy the 50mm 1.4 , which provides an 85mm field of view on my 1.6 crop factor camera . Defiantly a lower quality lens , but greater value for me ! Ps . many fashion photographers own both lenses ( 1.8 and 1.2 ) . They use the 1.8 most of the time along with the 135 2.0 ( another great lens ! ) and only pull out the 1.2 when the job calls for its special effects .  
1	  This item was returned to amazon as it did not work . It was tried on 3 different computers without success .  
2	  I just had to put in a good word for this product . I 've had it for 2 and a half years and it keeps me sane . I love all the bells and whistles that go along with it - i 'm always able to keep busy during " downtime " . From pic and vid capability , to the mp3 player ( and voice recording ) , to email , to scheduling and various Palm related tools - this product has been well worth the investment ! I 'm trying to hang in there as long as I can before I move on to the next model .  
1	  I was pretty happy when i first made the purchase , reading prior reviews with the features the 720 had . After receiving the item , i immediatley powered it to my cell phone . I wanted to use the plus services for traffic , i work evenings and encounter alot of roadwork which local news radio stations fail to give . i noticed the bluetooth feature captured my 720 for handsfree , but the other features failed . the tomtom website clearly states the razr v3 is compatible , it definitly isnt , as mine reached 65 % and gave me an error message , download failed . i called tomtom and was immediately given the run around , transfered to the technical dept , who then in turn transfered me to their mobile unit who never came on the phone . i emailed them directly , and received a reply that razr phones ARENT COMPATIBLE FOR PLUS SERVICES . i felt totally mislead , BEWARE IF YOU PLAN ON USING THE PLUS SERVICES WITH YOUR CELL .. granted there is an optional fm / traffic antenna which will run u back $ 129 or more , depending when you read this .  
1	  I wanted to like this item . It is plastic , but sturdy and nicely styled , but it only seems well-designed when it is Not compared to the Olympus models . Fortunately , mine went through the washing machine , and I now have the great experience of the Olympus .  
2	  Very impressive 4x6 color photo prints ! They look even better than prints I get from standard film developers ( couldn't find any pixels off with magnification ) . It will be interesting to see how efficient it is on the use of 8 different ink tanks . The cost for the 8 pack of new ink isn't cheap , currently coming in at $ 75 . Data I have seen from test labs show the total cost per 4x6 color photo print at . 57 cents and that includes the paper ( ww . pcworld . com / reviews / article / 0 , aid , 119573 , pg , 6,00 . asp ) For basic every day printing you don't care about the quality on , it might make sense to keep another cheap printer around , but for home printing of photos you want to have a terrific memory of this printer does the job and so much more !  
1	  Under " What 's in the Box " , it says that 3 and 6 eye emitters are included . Not in the box ( actually , blister wrap ) I got - all it had was a single emitter . But , I decided to go ahead and try it with my Direct TV HR34 . Charged up the battery for 48 hours , placed and plugged all the pieces as appropriate , all the proper lights light up when the remote button is pressed - but it won't control the HR34 , either via the emitter or by placing the flying saucer in front of the receiver . So , I tried to take the battery / transmitter out of my remote so I could return it , but the transmitter is actually slightly larger than a AA battery , and it wouldn't come out of the battery compartment without the help of needlenose pliers . I ended up damaging the casing , so now the piece of crap isn't even returnable . Don't waste your money .  
2	  Bought as a present for a friend , He is really having fun with it , making videos to send to others .. I can see him when we chat and the picture is very good .  
1	  I bought this hub 6 months ago . All ports were taken until half of them just quit working . This week , I lost a port on the other side and a matter of time before the whole unit is useless . I need to replace ASAP . It looks nice , but don't let that fool you . Not worth it . If you plan on keeping things plugged in all the time , look for something else . I 've had HUBS in the past which lasted me 6 + more YEARS !  
1	  If you 're looking for speakers to attach to your laptop , skip these and invest in a 2.1 speaker setup with a sub-woofer . For the price , and the fine Bose name , these speakers were just a little better than the speakers that came with my laptop . They have nice high and mid-ranges , but there is glaring lack of any bass response . Without out that , my music sounded dull and uninteresting . I 'm sure they could have done better , especially for this price .  
2	  I had a big Sony programable remote before . It was pretty much a pain . I got this one after reading some other favorable reviews . This thing works very nicely for me . The software is slightly glitchy , not a big problem . I have not had any problems at all with the remote hardware . I did have a minor problem where , for some reason , the remote refused to learn a command from my Sony AV receiver remote . It said it learned it OK , but pressing the button did not work . I worked around this issue . Also , the downloaded commands for the AV receiver were pretty lame . I had to " learn " quite a few to get it to work correctly . The standard commands for my other stuff were very good and took very little customization . However , I consider most of these things minor annoyances . This is a great remote for the money .  
2	  This cable isn't cheap . So why pay so much for it ? Why not just buy a cheap s-video cable ? Because the quality suffers . They don't just jack up the price for no reason . Gold tipped connecters , more shielding from interference , thicker wire , and better quality materials used provides a better picture . Colors are more vibrant , the whole picture more defined . You get what you pay for , and this Monster Cable is definitly proof of that . I have this cable and it is worth it . Monster all the way .  
2	  Bought this little mouse to carry with my Asus Netbook . Works perfectly and it does not require MS to operate . Makes my life much better . Could not live without it now that I 've had it a few weeks . If you own a Netbook , buy this mouse . It stores away very nicely also .  
1	  I got one of these at circuit city when they first came out . We paid over 800 dollars for it after about 10 months the picture started having issues with darker shades in the screen . So we went back to circuit city to show them we are having this problem . They had the set for about a week . They didnt call us to come and get it . Finally we went back . They said they had been watching it for a while and could not see what we were talking about . We still have the set and it gotten alot worse . Im just waiting for it to quit . That day we returned it they had them there for less the 400 dollars . I have never bought anything else there since ,  
2	  I first got this keyboard set .. and I loved it . It has a Very comfortable feel and it is easy on the wrists and fingers . I also liked the fact that it came with a wheel mouse which was great for the package price . ..  
1	  I have had my etrex vista for three years now . The reception is extremely poor in any wooded area . Even if I could get reception , if there is sun light you can not read the display . If there is a clearing it works fine . Otherwise , it loses the signal and is not useful . Also , it have sent back to garmin twice , once within Warranty and the same issue the screen failed 6 months later . The cost out of warranty was 3/4 of a new garmin . I have found reading other people 's reviews this is a common problem . In summary , save your money and buy another brand with a better antenna .  
1	  I have used an Olympus model VN-4100PC voice recorder for several years . It works great ! You can transfer files from the recorder to the computer . The only drawback is that you cannot download from the computer to the recorder . Battery life is good . Storage of files is good . Sound is loud and clear ! Along comes the newly released Olympus WS-710M . It is loaded with features and memory ! You can transfer files from the recorder to the computer ; and from the computer to the recorder . Great ! It has 8GB of memory Plus it has a slot for a microSD card . You can read for yourself all of the wonderful features that it has . You can download your music to it and use it as a MP3 player . And it has a FM radio included . ( Not a really big deal , but it is nice . ) I just received it today ; Thursday , October 7 , 2010 . I played with it all day . I am NOT happy with it ! I am very disappointed ! Why ? The sound . The sound or volume level is only half of what the Olympus model VN-4100PC is . Actually , it is LESS than half ! Both recorders have a volume ' meter ' that goes to 30 . At the highest , 30 , the Olympus WS-710M is barely heard . At the highest , 30 , the Olympus VN-4100PC can be heard ; it is loud and clear . I can listen to the VN-4100PC in the car , I can listen to it in the kitchen , I can listen to it sitting outside , and I can listen to it in my living room . I can take it anywhere and listen to it and hear it . With the headphones and without them ; especially without them ! I listen to it mostly without the headphones . I have to strain to hear the new Olympus WS-710M.That is why I am very disappointed . I have used a voice recorder to record lectures . I like to listen to those lectures . I barely can hear anything out of the Olympus WS-710M.I will try to return the Olympus WS-710M.I will return to using my Olympus VN-4100PC . It truly is good . But I will still be looking for something with the expanded memory ( 8GB ) and the additional features that the WS-710M promised but did not deliver .  
2	  These sound great , and are extremely comfortable . Sound doesn't get way too loud even at max volume . Clear sound , lightweight and great price .  
2	  Perfect bargain basement accessory . First set was destroyed by my 6 yr old daughter before the Holiday . The second set , in pink and significantly cheaper than the first , is working wonderfully . Let 's hope she holds onto these a little longer . At $ 8 / pr in pink not to worry . Great all around entry-level earbud . A little bass heavy , but not completely overdone . Acquits itself rather nicely against much higher priced models .  
2	  I have just started using this keyboard a few days ago so can't speak for durability . The extra hand rest is optional , and does need to be attached ( if space does not permit ) . This keyboard is not very quiet , just average on sound levels . There are 3 light options ( blue , red , purple ) and you can adjust the brightness of each , which is nice . Overall , it 's a good keyboard , serves the purpose , and works fine . I would buy it again if I had to .  
2	  I love it . I would go for the 6 quart for extra room next time .  
2	  This is a good piece of audio equipment . The connection mechanism has been improved over older models and the impedance compensating function is also an upgrade . However , be careful as to the manual . As hard as this is to believe , my unit had instructions for a prior generation of this product . The instructions for the connecting device have you pull the connector out of the back of the switch . If you 're successful , you will have rendered the switch inoperable . Otherwise , good unit .  
1	  I 'm using this with an old mac mini that is set up a a home theater box , so Windows users may have a better experience . Very frequently , almost every day , it loses its connection . I hit the connect button on the USB dongle and nothing happens . The only thing that works somewhat reliably is to remove the batteries . The fact that the battery door is flimsy plastic and doesn't close properly doesn't help things .  
1	  Until now I 've always had great luck with Panasonic products . The microphone quit after just 5 months of light useage . The warranty expired after 90 days . My advice is to spend more money for a poduct that will last .  
1	  * PLEASE READ * Memorex has changed the product and packaging . I have purchased these for several years and been very happy . At first I thought I ordered these from that online auction site and received fakes . The packaging is so flimsy that it tore open during shipping . It looks completely different than than photo prsented by Amazon ( the old packaging ) . See the photo I just uploaded ! The disks feel so thin , they are more like one-time-use disposable DVD 's than replayable quality DVDs . These disks are garbage . Update 7/18/09:4 of the first 10 disks are not readable by my brand new hp desktop dvd-recorder . It reads , " please insert correct recordable media " .. etc . , this is a 40 % failure rate so far . I 'm just throwing them in the trash each time I get that message . What a waste of money - save yours and buy a different brand .  
1	  The basic point here is that it probably won't work for you if you use WEP . Of course , now a days , we should all be using WEP ( as the instructions mention ) so this product should really be for no one . Realistically , there are people that don't use WEP and , for those people , this will probably work fine . I 'll be returning mine tomorrow . Here 's my whole story if it helps someone decide on this : When you attempt to use the setup wizard that comes on the included CD , it seems like everything would work fine for WEP ; however , when you get to the page asking about your WEP config , it has two possibilities : 64-bit and 128-bit . Trying to be as secure as possible , I use 128-bit . The problem here is that the field that allows you type in your 26 digit hexadecimal WEP key accepts only 13 digits ! If you enter only 13 with 128-bit selected and hit ' next ' , a box pops up that says you have to enter 26 but , frustratingly , you can not . If you use 64-bit WEP , this might would work for you . So , first I checked if there was an updated version of the wizard on the Linksys site ( actually , it 's very hard to find anything on this product currently on the Linksys site ( nice work , guys ) ) . I knew , though , that the product had a built-in website that you can use to configure it so I figured I 'd just use that . On the internal site I was able to configure WEP consistent with my settings . This was somewhat annoying , though , because the device does not have a hard-wire ethernet port so each step of the way , you loose the connection with the device as you change the wireless settings . I also found that it seemed simply saving the settings didn't result in them taking effect . Maybe I was too impatient but I ended up saving the settings and then unplugging and replugging the device in to restart it . This all seemed to work great despite the effort but it was still not talking to my other access point . I finally noticed that the SSID of this device has to be the same as the one it 's ' extending ' . I can see why they 'd do this to reduce the configuration needs on your wireless devices ; however , this means that once the SSID is set to the same as the other wireless device , if you need to continue to configure the WRE54G , you 'll have to turn off your other devices or go to a spot that you 're sure is out of range of your other devices so you can be certain you 're connecting to the WRE54G . Anyway , setting the SSID the same as the other device didn't seem to result in a ' link ' between the WRE54G and my other access point . So , foiled again , I called tech support . This was a bad experience . The woman I spoke to was a little hard to understand perhaps due to an accent I am not familiar enough with . Additionally , there were long pauses where I eventually realized someone was directing her on what to say . Everybody needs training so I did my best to be patient and play along . However , when we got to the part where I mentioned the model of the other Linksys access points I have , she ( well they ) basically told me that they were only supporting this device with 3 particular wireless-G access points . This contradicts what the box and the literature on the Internet says but I figured there was no point in arguing . They were good enough to point out that I could buy a couple WAP11 's and effectively do the same thing but that 's what I 'm already doing and that 's what I bought this product to avoid . I have at least 8 linksys products that I can think of ( not including this one as I 'm going to return it ) - 2x WAP11 , BEFW11S4 , WMA11B , BEFCMU10 , a hub , a PCI adapter , a PC card adapter and that 's just off the top of my head . I 've installed a couple of linksys products for my parents and recommended them countlessly . This is the product I 've been waiting for for years-a way to extend my wireless network without using two wireless devices , a wireless repeater . It 's really too bad . I 'm very disappointed . Between this and my experiences with the WMA11B , I 'm about done with Linksys . Tomorrow , I will buy D-Link and they 'll have the opportunity to earn my business and recommendation . If someone from Linksys is reading this , I 'd say , " My guess is you need to beef up your QA dept . I obviously have no clue what 's wrong with you but you ought to . Get it together ! "  
2	  The major strengths are the performance of the image sensor at 1600 ISO . It produces very good quality images here , and is a great way to break into the DSLR arena . Another great strength is the battery life . It can take almost two days ' worth of heavy vacation photos ( approx 6-700 exposures - 1/3 to 1/4 flash ) , before showing the need for a charge . It has a built-in editor that does red-eye repairs better than anything else I 've seen . The only weakness I can think of is the lack of an internal focusing motor , so that you couldn't have AF when using a Nikon film camera 's AF lenses on this body . It still works , just won't focus automatically . I you buy one of these , and wish to supplement the knowledge available from the owner 's manual , go here : $U$ Ken has done a great job of showing you how to get more out of this camera , or how to enjoy it more .  
1	  Contrary to other reviews I found that this card works fine with Windows Vista , but also contrary to other reviews I hate the fact that it has a fan rather than a heat sink . My once virtually silent desktop now has an extraordinarily annoying high-pitched screech . If I can't come up with a way to silence this thing I will have to remove it .  
1	  As soon as I opened the box and plugged it up for the first time , only one fan worked . I haven't even had the unit for 1 hour yet and it doesn't work right . Sending it back  
1	  I paid 85.00 for this product so I could have an expanded range in my home . Let me start by saying I am a fairly technical person . My problems began when I following the instructions exactly as stated . I was also trying to get WEP working which is a common problem I read in these reveiews . After I was done , I didn't have any wireless connections from two computers . I called Linksys and they wanted me to pay for support because my " router " ( not the extended ) was out of free support . I told them that the problem was with the software I just installed but they would not help me . I finally fixed got my computers back to their original state after a few hours , but without the Range Extended installed . Then a couple of weeks later I decided to try this installation one more time with Linksys support on the phone prior to starting . After an hour on the phone they told me the Range Expander was defective and to bring it back to the store . I was pretty sure there was nothing wrong with it , but more of a configuration / compatibility problem of some type . When I took it back to the store they told me that Linksys support always tells their customers the device is broken when the can resolve the problem . I decide to then buy a new 310N which claims to have expanded range . This problem was worse then the first . Eventually with Linksys on the phone , my laptop was working but my desktop just rebooted by itself all the time if my linksys adapter ( WMP54G ) was installed in the desktop . Linksys support told me that the new router was defective , or I should by a new ' N ' adapter for my desk top . By the way , the extra range I got out of the new 310N to my laptop was minimal . It is going back to the store also .  
2	  This is a great camera for those on the go and even those desktops which are stationary . I was so impressed with the first camera , I bought 5 more of these to give to other family members . The sound quality is great , you don't even need a microphone . Not to mention the video quality , just amazing . I would highly recommend .  
1	  I purchased this product , charged it , downloaded songs onto it , attempted to play it , screen went black and hasn't turned back on since . Waste of money !  
2	  Great Camera ! Hard to find because they dont make them any more . Great for scrapbooking and generally lots of fun . Stock up on film cause it is getting harder and harder to find too !  
1	  The idea behind these headphones sounds kind of strange but they do actually make a significant difference in the feel of music that has a lot of bass . BUT .. The problem with the design of the headphones makes the benefits somewhat moot . When I was able to get the ear pieces to fit in my ears properly ( by holding them there ) I was able to see what panasonic was intending by adding the vibrating component . But I had to hold them there and if I didn't the buds would pull back rather painfully on my ears . Furthermore , the sound was terrible because they wouldn't sit properly in my ears . I don't know if it 's just that I have a big head ( I do ) , or if it is just bad design , but these just don't quite seem to work as well as they could . If you like to feel bass these might be worth a try but don't be surprised if you find yourself returning them a couple days later .  
1	  This DVD player was pretty nice while it lasted . We had it for 8 months before it stopped working . The warranty is only for 3 months . It stopped loading DVDs . It would spin , but not load . The picture was nice and clear , sound was pretty good . This time we are going with a Sony - in my opinion a more reliable brand with a year warranty .  
1	  They sold me a used and dead product and never returned any of my emails about it . Not work it , go to Apple Store and buy a real one that works .  
1	  Just like several other reviewers , I experienced a sudden loss of signal in one channel - in my case , it came after about 10 months of light use . Not recommended !  
2	  My mp3 player didn't have enough power to get good sound on my Cycle Sound bicycle speakers . The Boosteroo gave me just the boost I needed .  
2	  I use this fan on my 17 " notebook . Was worried at first b / c of size difference but it sits flat and haven't had any problems . Definitely was skeptical but am pleasantly surprised and have recommended this product to family and friends . I noticed an improvement in performance and will be purchasing another for another member of household . Also , I like that it has a speed adjustment dial , instead of low / high settings or none at all on other coolers . It came well-packaged and took 5 minutes to unpack and get running . * Update 5/4/12I am STILL using this fan . It 's working the same as day 1 , except that I have made an effort to clean it out from time to time . I have 2 cats that like leaning against the back of the laptop and the fan sucks in some hair . It collects in the front of the fan and to get it out , ( After I turn it off ) I tip the fan backwards so the debris falls towards the 2 fans and I can pull it out from there with needlenose pliers or tweezers or knife or whatever you have handy . I am gentle with it and do not bang it around or treat it poorly . I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend it . I use a large 17 " laptop and do notice a difference when I 'm not using it . I have a smaller fan , meaning the depth ; the width is the same , and I prefer the full base models as my other laptop tends to tip off the smaller unit . I have to re-adjust the base fan periodically . Barely annoying but thought to mention it .  
1	  I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas .. along with a nice digital camera . The camera works great ( a Canon ) but this card never worked . I tried the camera I own also - which is also a Canon . You can't format it because it says it 's locked . It 's not locked though . I tried flipping the switch a few times in case of a glitch but that didn't help . My computer doesn't recognize it either . I 'm glad others have ones that work .. kudos to them . But I 've learned my lesson .. you get what you pay for - in camera cards and everything else .  
2	  Audio choices are obviously very personal , so I hesitate to recommend anything too strongly here . Tastes and tolerances differ so greatly , and wireless audio products really seem to push those differences . Maybe some of my needs and wants will match yours , maybe not , but please consider my thoughts here in light of the many personal qualifiers that I add . Those qualifiers may or may not relate well to your own situation . By the way , my apologies in advance for such a long review , but I really appreciate details when researching audio gear . I thought you might , too . BACKGROUNDI 'm about as picky as they come when sound is the issue . I have a small home recording studio and 30 years of experience as a semi-pro musician ( jazz , rock , classical , country ) . That said , I approach every musical equipment purchase with thorough research and comparison . Since I already have good wired phones ( Senn 280s , Audio Technica M50s , and others ) in my studio , I wanted some wireless cans mostly for moving around the house and yard while listening to music from my home stereo system , kind of a self-indulgent luxury . I 've read enough to know that any wireless models using a radio signal ( the best type of signal if you 'll be in a different room than the transmitter ) will produce some hiss and pop on occasion . I accepted this fact before buying . Still , I decided I would not accept something else : poor sound quality , in a musical sense . Two of the sub-$200 phones with rather consistently high reviews ( in magazines and online ) were the Senn 130 and 140 models . So I ordered both models to compare them in the privacy of my home . ( I paid about $ 115 for the RS-130 and $ 135 for the RS-140 ; be patient because the prices here fluctuate often . ) TEST EQUIPMENTA 100-watt / channel JVC receiver and JVC CD player-both typical ( low-end ) home stereo components . To suit my personal tastes for EQ , I boosted some at 16 kHz ( to add air to the highs ) and at 60 Hz ( to add depth to the lows ) . FOR MUSIC NOT TVI 've used these cans mostly for listening to music , which usually masks any low-grade background noise . TV use , with its emphasis on dialogue , would be demanding in other ways , so I 'd defer to other reviewers for feedback concerning that application . POINT OF REFERENCEThe entry-level price for a decent set of wired ( corded ) cans is roughly $ 100 . The price of these wireless Senns , especially the 130s , isn't much more . LIKESMusically , both models sound as good as I 'd hoped except for their shy response at the extremes ( see Test Equipment above ) . Still , when I 've been wearing them while working outside , I sometimes have to stop what I 'm doing , raise the volume , and just listen for a while . They sound that good . I wouldn't use them in my studio , but considering the low price and mobility , I 'm very satisfied . As I 'd read , the open-back 130s sound ( and look ) a bit like Senn 's popular 580 audiophile ( wired ) model-open , smooth , warm , and most of all , pretty well balanced . The closed-back 140s have a similar sound , maybe a bit boxier , overall , as is typical of closed cans . I think that some folks ( such as heavy rock n ' rollers , rappers , computer gamers , the hearing impaired , and even office workers ) might prefer the 140s for their enhanced isolation , but I found the 130s , which offer the spacious open-back sound that made Senn famous , to provide the flatest , truest sound , overall . After a lot of back and forth listening to verify my impressions , I kept the 130s . The 140s would be a perfectly acceptable alternative , though . The differences are minor . Both models are cushy comfortable , and the features and controls are top-notch . I 've never liked surround-sound simulations and the like , so I can't comment on that feature ( 130s ) . But I find everything very simple to use , and all works fine . Like easy ? Hang these Senns up and they turn off and charge automatically . Press a button and they tune their reception and then memorize it , also automatically . The reception 's very good , too , after I improved it significantly by moving the transmitter unit to a slightly higher shelf and trying the different freq-channel options . Remember this if you buy . Also remember to boost the source volume plenty so that the phones receive a strong signal . ( By the way , I 've read that you may experience greater interference noise if you live in a congested area , which I don't . ) DISLIKESNo review would be complete without some criticism and warning , so here 's mine . Above all , choosing musical equipment involves personal tastes , which vary greatly , so try to listen before buying . Trust your own ears . If you do buy either Senn wireless model , you should expect some hiss and pop and hum at times , usually just when you move around , but almost certainly if you head outside or into another room far from the base unit . ( The stated spec of " up to 150 meters " seems laughable . ) You may even notice the sound strengthen and weaken on occasion . In this price range , at least , I think you 'll need to accept such reception problems or else stay with wired cans . Period . Wireless freedom is never perfect , is it ? Beyond that , I wish these cans were as snug-fitting as my Senn 280s , which grip my head tightly . These wireless phones are like light pillows , very comfortable since they sit ' around ' the ears ( not ' on ' the ears ) , but I 'd bet that some folks with smaller heads could find them to be a bit loose when walking around . And finally , another obvious point-bad or good , depending on your situation-is that the 130s ( which I prefer in terms of smoother , truer sound ) are open-air cans , meaning that you 'll hear your family if in the same room . That 's good for staying in contact but bad if you want to get away from outside noise . The closed 140s are certainly better for blocking out a barking dog or not disturbing a nearby loved one . COMMENT ABOUT INTERFERENCE PROBLEMSIf you 're not already totally sick of me , you can check out my reaction to the interference problems that some users report here . ( Click on ' Comments ' below . ) OVERALLAll in all , both models of these phones admirably meet my picky expectations although being realistic about the limits of low-cost wireless sound was a necessary starting point . Nah , these wireless phones aren't perfect , and they 're certainly no match for good wired cans , but I think they offer impressive overall performance for $ 100 plus change . An enthusiastic ' 4 and a 1/2 stars ' and a lot of brag from me . Well done , Senn . Happy listening , all . P.S. TO ANYONE WITH HEARING LOSSIf you have reduced hearing , particularly in one ear , you should probably choose the RS-140 model . The addition of the closed back ( for isolation ) , L-R balance control , and compression switch ( to equalize the overall volume ) could be helpful . NEED MORE RESEARCH ? Head over to " Consumer Search " online for a master summary of pro and consumer reviews of wireless headphones , including these . ( The Senns do very well . ) UPDATE ( 2011 ) A quick update , more than six years of frequent use later : no surprises , no regrets . I stand by my review fully . I did find one time that the headphones didn't work , but a quick jiggle of the audio input in the base unit brought them back to life . True , as some folks have noted , there is indeed annoying interference at times but usually just when moving around in another room or outdoors . That 's only a minor limitation for me but clearly a deal-breaker for some people ( although some of them , I suspect , haven't boosted the source volume enough ) . But the surprisingly good music quality and thoughtful design at this low price point is the real story here for me and my primarily musical needs . If you eventually decide to give the Senns a try , just be sure that you can easily return them if they don't fit your own needs and limits . I typically return about half of the audio equipment I buy , even after thorough research , and have learned the value of a simple return policy . Good luck to you . DISCLAIMER ( 2011 ) I notice that the price has nearly doubled since when I wrote my review , and that would change things for me . If I had this much to spend on wireless cans , I 'd likely opt for Senn 's new RS-180 model instead .  
1	  It didn't even last 18 months . First the CD player stopped working , then the alarm stopped working reliably and now even the clock doesn't work . I 'm very disappointed .  
2	  Just what I ordered . Now I have to remember that it requires manual settings rather that through the lense metering .  
2	  Will extend the life of console games , DVDs and CDs . Provides a thin transparent cover to discs . Protects the surface from kids moving them around and scratching them .  
2	  I bought this for mt 9 year old daughter and she loves it ! I love it too . We now share it-it 's so nice and small for running , easy to use for my daughter . I totally would recommend this product for anyone that enjoys having their music at their fingertips-literally . Can't beat the price either .  
1	  I bought this unit and I sent it back after I received it . The main reason is that it does not work with Directv receiver remotes . I searched the internet and found that many others had the same problem . None of the codes work . The picture quality seemed good but I didn't want to bother with using 2 remotes on this TV - too many remotes in the house already . Another thing I didn't like about this TV was the stand .  
1	  I was rather unimpressed with the cheap cardboard-like slip cover that you have to remove to scan in 35mm film strips . After 20 scans , the scanner stopped working . I emailed cannon support and after a few emails , they informed me that the scanner was defective . Wonderful . Next time , I 'm getting an Epson .  
2	  Didn't have a problem with these cables . I made one run of about 30-50 feet , and as soon as I crimped everything , the connection worked with no problems . I did a lot of twisting and bending of the cable for my run too , so I think it 's safe to say that it withstood the rough treatment .  
1	  voice quality is very poor as all is garbled - that is if you can get it to record anything at all ..  
2	  It would 've been nice if it were compatible with my slik tripod 's quick shoe , but it 's slightly too big . That might be asking a bit too much though . I 'm happy with it and it 's cheap .  
2	  This is a replacement for theTargus PA248U Notebook Chill PadI had for 3 yrs and it done its job . I got this product when my Tragus Chill Pad finally quit on me . I only had the Zalman Notebook Cooler for a week and I must say , I am very impressed . Not only does it keep my notebook from overheating , the pad stays cool itself . I also like being able to adjust the air flow .  
2	  Item was shipped promptly , and worked great . It was as described , and the price was reasonable .  
1	  I suffered with this unit for about 2 weeks before I caved and returned it . I replaced it with a FAR more expensive Apple Airport Extreme , which works wonderfully . ( I have a mixed Mac / Wintel LAN ) . I think my unit was defective , probably a defective 10/100 switch . It worked well in wireless mode , with range better than my older SMC ( wireless card failed on that one ) . I really stress my LAN ( backups , etc ) so I might expose problems others might not notice . I suspect though that this is a true defect that hits some of these devices . I wonder , though , if the MR814 ever works properly with a secondary external switch . When I bought the device it didn't work at all with my Cisco 675 DSL / router , but a firmware update fixed that . Still , a bad sign that out of the box it was DOA on my LAN . Tech support never replied to an email inquiry . If you buy this device , .. DO NOT SEND IN THE REBATE UNTIL YOU 'RE SURE YOU WON'T RETURN IT . ..  
2	  If you 're looking for a tiny , manageable thing : don't get this one . It takes more space than you might imagine . But it works ! Like a champ . And after going through 3 GE machines , and counting on the reviews I found here for some prepurchase comfort , I 'll add my 2 cents and tell everyone : " This Microwave is worth it from all angles . " I am totally satisfied with this muthu ' .  
1	  This printer is a total rip-off . It has never once printed something properly the first time . We constantly have to clean it which immediately prompts that the printer is now low or out of ink . Which means every single time we need to print something , regardless of whether its a 4-color print on photo paper or a plain black and white , 8.5x11 print , we have to go through a lengthy process before it prints even remotely close to right and often ends up with us buying $ 40-60 in ink . I absolutely loathe this printer .  
2	  works as promised and very heavy shielding . It has a feel of quality .  
1	  DVD player quit working after one movie . After unit cools off over night , it acts as if it wants to start but doesn't . CD player just stops from time to time and has to be restarted . The automatic VCR tracking does not seem to work .  
1	  Just like the other reviewer our 8820 worked fine the first few months then started getting very grey and grainy . We also have Windows ME although no one at Visioneer has yet suggested that may be the problem . Tech support never answers , forcing us to contact the " pay " tech support line . They told us once that the PC must have 85 % performance or above for it to work , which led me to Dell since our performance was never above 82 % . Dell want me to re-install the operating system . Visioneer gave me some stuff to edit in files and registry , which made no difference . We too are ready to buy a different scanner - I would not recommend ANY Visioneer scanner due to their deplorable tech support .  
1	  All the bad reviews on this can't be a coincidence . RCA knows this is garbage but they continue to sell it anyway instead of recalling it . I bought it locally in a clearance outlet for $ 40 . That should tell you something . I returned the first one as the CD player was making awful scraping and knocking noises . Tonight I exchanged it for another and the loud noises have been replaced with clicking sounds , CD skipping and a noticably loud CD motor . I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this because tomorrow I have to return this AGAIN ! This time , though , I 'm getting my $ 40 back ! Bite the bullet and buy the Cambridge Soundworks 730 ( radio only ) or 740 ( with CD ) . Expensive but worth it after this experience . You get what you pay for never sounded more true after buying this sorry excuse of a radio .  
1	  The WORST jobsite radio . The FM reception is a joke , you move away from the radio and it goes out . The CD player is hit or miss . Basically this is good for the GFIC , but even that is a pain with the doors covering the plugs . Don't buy this !  
1	  Although this monitor has a good picture and is priced fairly , you should think twice about purchasing a Viewsonic . Their customer service is atrocious and this is important because it will be needed if your experience is like mine : Your monitor turns itself off and degausses itself . you 'll be on hold 45 minutes and pay $ 50 to have another shipped to you , which arrives and is " refurbished " . Your " refurbished " monitor will stop waking up from sleep mode after a month or so . You 'll wish you 'd spent the extra $ 20 and got that Sony . This monitor is the Fiat of displays . You should buy two , as you 'll be needing a backup .  
1	  The sound quality of these earphones is really good . I was very pleased with my purchase until about 4 months ( 1 month past warranty ) into them , when I noticed bare wire on the cord in two places . The cord is very cheaply made and doesn't seem to stand up to the normal wear and tear . I love the sound quality , but the cord problem can present a serious problem .  
2	  This charger is known to be the world most powerful and advance charger . Its very expensive but worth every single penny . Every rechargeable batteries of different brand ( Sanyo NiMH , GP NiCd ) that I have works fine with it . At first I had one the GP battery couldn't be charged up by my previous charger but Ansmann is powerful enough to bring this " dead " GP battery back to life and kickingIts comes with dual voltage ( 110-240V ) operation which means you can bring this charger to any part of the world and it still work fine , useful for people that travels a lot .. My previous charger can only work on 230V , I can't use it on countries running on 110V ! Great Product !  
1	  I find this case difficult to use . Yes , it prevents scratches , but so would a safety vault - which is basically what this thing is . The case itself is absolutely impossible to get into ; its a struggle every time . If you plan on being able to actually access your palm pilot , go with the soft case .  
1	  We bought this dvd player in May of 2004 , used it 4 or 5 times . The sound is very low in the car so you must buy the ear phones . We pulled it out recently for a trip and the left hinge just broke ! We were very careful with this item and yet it broke and is out of warranty . Save your money and don't buy Polaroid DVD players .  
1	  I 'd agree with some of the earlier comments . I got this as part of an iPod package deal thing . I already had I believe a Memorex version of the adapter from way back in the day when I 'd use my Discman in the car . I tried this new one just for the heck of it and the rattling was very distracting . Went back to the 15-year-old model I have and it works just great ..  
1	  I purchased this VCR after reading some of the postive reviews on this site . It worked for 1 day and then began a strange whirring noise when I turned the power on and would not recognize that it had a tape in it and then would just cut off . I am returning it tomorrow for my money back . I should have known it was crap when I took it out of the box and it weighed about a pound . My old Magnavox VCR was of a substantial weight and lasted 10 years of continuous use . I spent $ 95 on this Panasonic and would recommend spending your money on something else .  
2	  This DVD Player is wonderful . Not only will it play my DVD , CD 'S , but also my VIDEO CD 'S I go to the store get my film on Video CD 's and I can watch my pictures on my tv I love it !  
2	  I 've used this motherboard since it came out , and no problems . Has lots of slots so it 's easy to upgrade with newer stuff ( except the CPU ) . Would recommend this to anybody !  
1	  I 2nd the comments on the incompatability with Mac OS 10.4 . I purchased this to share a wireless keyboard & mouse USB set with a Mac & PC and despite what the box says Belkin 's $ 60 switch doesn't work with Mac OS . The installation guide & users manual is a complete joke - Belkin throws in a leaflet on how to install on a mac ( a 2-inch by 2-inch single sided set of instructions with 12 steps ) as an afterthought to the 20 page PC manual . Not only that , Belkin completely leaves out how to use the software once its loaded on the Mac - low & behold THERE IS NO SWITCH FUNCTION ON THE MAC ONCE THE SOFTWARE IS LOADED . There is a note about using " ALT + F11 " but that gets no response what so ever . It would be nice if Belkin would release software that actually works as advertised for Mac with this switch !  
1	  you have to position laptop just right to get any cooling from this pad . And even when in exact position you only get minimul coolingmy laptop fan still runs constant to cool so I have found a USB port Fan cooler is much better and not as loud as my laptop fan trying to cool itself all the timePut your money toward a USP fan cooler insteadAFTER ABOUT 6 MONTHS this was awful - the " bumps " that are suppose to hold up your laptop were all smooshed down so no airflow at all - another item for the trash can :(  
2	  I use both an Epson R1800 and a Stylus Pro 4800 and the prints come out looking beautiful ! Colors are accurate and rich and the surface catches light just right . Can't go wrong using this product .  
1	  If you have a case on your Ipod you will have to remove it to plug in .  
2	  There is enough reviews so I 'll keep mine short . Picture Quality is equal to the Sony Bravia in HD . The finish is excellent on the Samsung , definitely better than the Bravias though both are solidly built . My only gripe is that the remote to TV response is very slow .  
2	  This is a great FM Transmitter . I was a little concerned about purchasing it after reading some poor reviews , however , it wasn't too expensive , so I went for it . I have been completely happy with this product . I have really liked the fact that I can select any frequency , rather than a few presets as in other models . This way I can find an empty frequency no matter where I am . Sometimes you have to figure out the best place for it to be in relationship to the radio , but it really does work well . I usually use it in my car , but I also tried it with a stereo system in my house and that had even better reception than in the car . I would definitely recommend this product and I am planning on buying it again as a gift for a family member in the near future  
1	  The other poor reviews are right-the cradle doesnt work , and logitech support is awful . STAY AWAY  
2	  Cables to Go has great deals on network cables with top notch quality . Much better value than retail stores .  
1	  I have an ASUS DVR Lightscribe drive and out of the 10 DVDs I was able to burn the label correctly on 1 ( one ) of them ! Most of the others could not be recognized as lightscribe media by the drive and software . The rest burned swirls on the label surface as if there is a registration mark that is not seen correctly by the drive . I have some HP CD lightscribe media that I easily burned in between making coasters with the Memorex diskc , so I feel confident that it is the media , not the drive . Big thumbs down .  
2	  Very Likely Your First Lens Will Be This One .. They Are Incorperated Into Most Of The Canon Kits Available Today , And Why Not ? .. It Features The Most Popular Focal Lenghts .. From Wide Angle To Telephoto , This Zoom Lens Gives You The Best Of Both Worlds .. The Apature Is Kind Of Limited , But For A Starter Lens , This Is Great ..  
1	  Just like Mark ( posting April 5 , 2006 ) , I charged the thing up , filled it full of great music , and went out for my usual run . It worked for about a half-hour and then died . Tried everything to get it going again but nothing . Am taking it to the Apple store at the local mall to see if they have any suggestions . Hopefully , I can send it back to Amazon and get my money returned . Sigh !  
1	  I 'm experienced with networking , as I have 5 computers networked in my home . This product kept cutting out my internet connection every 18 minutes . So any java type application , etc . would stop and I would have to reconnect mirc , aol , realtick type apps . ( .. ) I RETURNED THIS ITEM !  
2	  I got the 4GB pink iPod mini in May 2005 . The colour is great and it has never got scratched . It is so easy to use . The click wheel is great ! iTunes is really easy to use aswell . Unlike many other MP3 players the iPod mini has games and a calendar and an alarm and a clock and lots of other extras on it aswell . My sister loved my iPod so much that she got a shuffle . I love my mini so much !  
1	  This book is suitable for a relatively small group of folks who perhaps have been to this shop and would like to know the story of the people who work there . The amount of recipes in this book is very small compared to the amount of pages devoted to the people who own / work / etc . in the shop . If you 're looking for tea-related recipes , look elsewhere .  
2	  Correct rating on these I received via Amazon from Parts Express ( printed right on the product ) : 150Hz @ 8ohms300Hz @ 4ohmsSo these are useless to me personally . I contacted Parts Express via email , and they quickly and professionally handled my issue . Very very happy with the seller Parts Express !  
2	  I bought this based on another readers review concerning this adaptor with osX and yes , it 's perfect ! I have no idea why Mac compatibility isn't listed but with OSX you just plug it in and it works . I 'm running 10.3.4 as of this writing and absolutely no issues to speak of . And it 's 15 bucks less than the adaptor that Apple recommends . Choice is good ! ..  
2	  I needed to run cable from router to a downstairs video setup and this works great . Faster and more reliable than wireless .  
1	  I was trying to replace my car stereo with this device along with an iPOD Nano , but it didn't work . Very bad Recept-Trans . Probably it has do with the car and the area . But I 'm guessing that this product do not have any kind of noise reduction technology or filters .. its just a receiver-transmitter device and it 's a matter of luck either it works or not .  
2	  I am not a photographer by any means . I was looking for a simple and easy to use digital camera with a telescopic lens at an inexpensive price . I looked and compared cameras all over the internet and in stores . This camera is simply a dream . While it has many different camera settings for absolutely great pictures I just typically leave it in the automatic mode , focus my shot , and let the camera do the rest . Superb pictures but the only thing I do not like is the lens is frozen when you take video . It doesn't zoom in or out . If you purchase a 4 GB card you 'll be able to take up to 1000 still photos and an 8GB over 2000 stills before you need to download .  
1	  This thing is just like a real Dell PC with a Windows OS-including the bugs , glitches , hangs , quirks , frustrations , and crashes ! It 's uncanny . After all the required and non-required patches ( which take forever-and good luck navigating Dell 's website ! ) , it still perfoms like a steaming turd . Takes forever to boot up . Hit the power button and wait 20 seconds or so for the stupid " Dell " screen to go away . Now you enter your password , then wait 10 or 15 seconds for the numbers that you tapped to show up on screen . Now you 've only got 10 or 15 seconds more to wait before the thing becomes responsive to your input . I got this thing so I could pull it out of my pocket and take notes / look something up quickly . I can do these things-just not quickly . I had a palm before this , and I never had a single issue . Hit the power button , then open your application . Instantly . Amazing . Do yourself a favor and get a palm or maybe an HP ( haven't tried an HP yet , but you couldn't do worse than this turd . ) Dell even inclues their crappy over-seas tech support ! Go ahead , leave them a message on their site . Will they get back to you ? Who knows ! They never wrote me back . Wow , did I feel important .  
2	  I bought this camera for my daughter-in-law , so I can see my granddaughter when she 's born . I chose this model because I bought one eight months ago , and mine works just fine . I use it weekly on Skype for a group meeting , and no one ever complains that they can't hear me which happens for some of the others . I use it as a microphone , mostly , but the video has been fine when I used it .  
1	  The main negative issue was volume control . These itty-bitty buttons that access the control took 10 or more seconds to activate the control panel items . The volume on radio was not equal to the CD volume so switching playback from CD to radio was a lesson in frustration to a point I thought the product was defective and returned it to Amazon for an exchange . The new one came and it was the same design flaw . I returned it and bought a similar product at Walgreens for one-third the price . The rating is a zero star . Amazon 's customer support was so superb , it was almost worth the trouble .  
2	  Good product . The price was right and trhe quality was exceptional . I woiuld definetly buy this again . It was great !  
1	  I bought two of these chargers from Microsoft . The first one was dead right out of the box , not even trying to charge . The second one died within a week - if I unplug the controller from the charging cable , the controller dies in less than five minutes , even if left to charge for hours . I 've learned my lesson and will not be trying a third time . This cheaply-made product is not worth the money .  
2	  First let me just say , this is NOT a pro camcorder ! WIth that said , this is one of the best investments I made for making memories . I had HDR-HC1 for about a year and used it moderately , and have been very happy with the results . Pros : 1 . Great picture . 2 . Very light . Your arm will not get tired . 3 . Easy to use . Just put tape in and you are ready . 4 . Easy to connect to MacBook . Plug and play . Cons . 1 . Needs more zoom . 2 . Build in mic not too great . 3 . Short battery life . 4 . Small view angle . There are some drop outs on the video , but i think that is because I use " the " cheapest tapes I can find . Even so , I only noticed one drop in 12-14 tapes . Good luck .  
2	  After researching extensively I bought this little system and I love it . I need my music with me constantly and this little system zips up and goes everywhere so easily ( bathroom , by the pool , hotel ) . The battery life is long , it 's never died on me . The sound quality is quite good and loud for a small inexpensive system . Several friends have bought it since seeing / hearing it at my house . One of my most satisfying electronic purchases in a while !  
1	  These don't have good volume . really quiet . and to top it off one of the ear buds went out after 3 weeks of use .  
1	  I use this product as an intake for my computer . The vent cover is curved , off-color , and ugly . It took about 2 weeks for the fans to start malfunctioning . Now on the left , I have a fan that squeals non-stop , in the middle a fan that barley works , and the right that works perfectly . After installing this item , I saw no difference in temperature .  
2	  This bag is awesome . Light and strong , with more than enough space and pouches to hold my wireless base and mic , the wireless base for my in-ear monitors , the monitors / ear buds case and hip pack , two sets of cables , two power supplies , a flashlight and extra batteries . It 's compact and weighs a ton less than my hard case . After I received this , I was so impressed I bought two more Gator bags ( different styles ) for some other musical equipment .  
1	  Thought I was getting a good deal when I purchased this , however the cable was so awful , I was better off using the old cable from my DVR player , not an HDMI . BAD quality . Now I have to get a new one .  
1	  Bought from Walmart in July 2007 . Got it home & found out the second day that it wouldn't play certain store bought DVDs that my old $ 29 Apex did . I let that slide because I hate the Walmart return line . When I went to record DVD 's , I only had 2 turn out out of 9 . Oh , it wrote on the disc , but then it wouldn't recognize it to finalize it . Some video tapes will not play . One 's that do sometimes have intermittently cut out audio ( cartoons - not just movies ) . When deleting stations from the tuner memory , the deleted one 's always come back . It ruined 2 DVD 's because some DVD 's just would not eject from the DVD tray even after cycling off then on again and even unplugging the chord when all else failed . I had to manually try to get it open . I would have returned it to Walmart sooner if all of the problems would have showed up at the beginning . However , I waited until the last straw with my DVD 's not ejecting and now that it 's the end of November , Walmart said to deal directly with the manufacturer . I dread the whole process to come . I have read reviews of the same problems on other sites . I have also heard of the hassle with RCA ( which I will be experiencing shortly ) . DO a search on the product if you really are considering buying it . The features can't be beat for the price , however not all of the features work properly . I don't suppose it has anything to do with being made in China .. but it too may contain lead based paint :)  
2	  I have this lens a little less than a week now . I am using it with a Nikon D200 . I have 6 lenses that I use - including my favorite Nikon dx 18-200 mm vr , but for portraits this lens is a killer with an equivalent of 75 mm focal length on the D200 . The lens is very sharp with great contrast and color . For a little over $ 100.00 I think this is the best buy in a lens on the market for a Nikon camera .  
2	  I love it . Easy to use , works as promised , priced right , a winner all round . I bought it so that I could use my mouse and the phone at the same time . Perfect . And inexpensive . It 's great , no problems .  
2	  Easy to use , easy to set up , saves time and was , for all that it does , cheap . There is an update on Microsoft 's hardware website . Liked it so much I bought one for each computer . Buy it , you will like it . Rich  
1	  The ear buds seem to work ok for the rest of the band , but mine came with a bad connection . The company has not replied to my emails to them . You would probably be better off getting custom molded ones for about the same price .  
2	  I went into the market to find some replacement headphones for my Ipod . I found two pairs of headphone ER6i and the Shure210B . These out performed the Shure in the tests so I went wtih these . These are good headphones but I would like to see the cables heavier .  
2	  I really had my doubts but this stuff is AMAZING ! I got it for my husbands new i580 cell phone ( outside window had deep scratches ) . We were shocked at how well it worked . So we decided to try it on my husbands ( who 's an auto technician ) severly scratched Snap On Modis scan tool . It worked great . It does take some time ( we used cotton balls which worked great ) but WELL worth the effort . And the bottle still looks full . Try it-you will not be disappointed !  
1	  I bought 1 40 pack of these disks so that I could create a set of Windows 95 setup disks . They worked to install windows once and then they all started dying . I went to run Windows setup and got halfway through and got a " cannot read from device " error . After that I ran scandisk on all of them and only 1 disk didnt have bad sectors . A few of the disks had bad sectors in the system area rendering them unformattable . I advise anybody who reads this to steer clear of these cute little disks unless you want to use them as christmas ornaments .  
1	  I did my homework , and though I knew this trackball was mechanical and rather an old model , I still thought that overall many people had been happy with it . I have used trackballs before to a limited extent , and my husband has the Kensington Optical Trackball with the cool red glow , but I wanted something that would better match my Mac . Well , forget about that . The Orbit got very difficult to manipulate very soon after use .. I had cleaned it several times in the first week , and I am a clean freak where the area around my Mac is concerned . I found that the tiny springs inside were very fragile and one was not really in the right place . After two weeks I sent this back to AMAZON . It is pretty , it SHOULD work better , but after thinking it over I ditched " matching " , went out to Staples and tried the Logitech Marble Mouse . It is a great fit for my hand , and now resides on my desk . The marble mouse is cheaper too , which is odd . If I hadn't wanted a trackball right away I would have bought it at AMAZON . Your options aren't that great pricewise as far as trackballs go , which makes the Marble Mouse a really good deal , unless you are a power user of photo manipulation software or other specific apps which need many buttons programmed .  
1	  This printer is incredibly frustrating to use ! I had an earlier version that worked better until it jammed and then broke . This one is terrible - it either doesn't pick up the paper so it thinks it 's out of paper , or it jams , or there 's some other error . It is a piece of junk . When it does work correctly ( and this is after 1 1/2 hours of messing with it ) , the pictures are beautiful . However , the ink and the paper are not designed well enough to work together despite Kodak 's claims - I always run out of ink before I run out of paper , and you can't purchase just the ink without the paper . Overall , I have to say that few things aggravate me as much as this printer . The reason I 'm giving it 2 stars instead of 2 is because when it works , it works great . But it 's such a piece of crap that it rarely works . I wouldn't give this printer to my worst enemy !  
1	  There are plenty of other sleeves to choose from ; don't choose these . Both were ripped at the corners when I opened the box , and they only included one clear cover to protect the screen . Useless if you 're giving one of the sleeves to someone else .  
1	  I had it for a month , never use it until five minutes ago . Opened the box , plugged in the wall outlet , plugged in the cell phone charger . Immediately , a loud " POP " and strong smell of something burning . The surge protector itself is FRIED ! Good thing I haven't plugged in my cell phone to the charger . I unplugged it from the wall outlet , there goes straight into the trash can .  
2	  I was skeptical about buying the Twin Turbo . We had to create about 1500 new file labels on a project . We also wanted to have 2 types of label formats available without having to change the label spool each time . Enter the Twin Turbo . This is a great product . Fast , Clean and Sharp . NOTE : 1 tip . Make sure that when you load the labels that you keep the spool of labels tight with no slack . Feed the labels into the printer very tightly . This will eliminate errors and line erros . GREAT PRODUCT !  
1	  The VGA connector is NOT male but female . So I could not use this cable to directly connect my video card DVI output to my monitor vga input and still have to use a clunky 2 part contraption . :-(  
2	  I spent hours reading GPS reviews by people who bought them and finally chose this unit . I am not disappointed at all . It will get you to wherever you are going without a problem . It doesn't always choose the fastest route because of redlights and traffic , but if I use the " shortest " route feature , it tends to almost always choose the route 's I 've used as " shortcuts " to places I already commute . I 've even read some negative comments from people and they are unwarranted , unless you expect this unit to do the driving for you too . One comment I read repeatedly was that it tells you to turn too late . I haven't found that to be true at all . If you are a lead-foot , then it will be late because it 's designed to tell you right as you approach the turn . If you drive like a maniac , it can't keep up . Drive the speed limits , and you will be told exactly when to turn . It also warns you on your last turn , how far your next turn will be , so simply pay attention and you can't go wrong . I 'm sure there are some exceptions , depending on where you live , as to how good this unit performs , such as newly developed areas and such , but that will be the same issue no matter which product you purchase . This unit is everything I expected , wanted , and more .. You 'll never be lost again !  
2	  Great set of sturdy half shelves includes hardware to attach to rack . Inexpensive for a set of two racks , packaged well .  
2	  The perculator is everything we expected . We have used this Presto product before and are still very satisfied . Will purchase again .  
2	  I have one at work and now one at home . Does exactly what you would expect with no issues . Let me save you some grief though .. If you are trying to boot from the floppy and need to set your BIOS to have the floppy drive first in the boot order , make sure you have the USB floppy drive plugged in before powering the computer and entering the BIOS setup . If you don't the computer will not see that a floppy is available and will not give you the choice of booting from it . Hope this helps .  
2	  his is my first time using a underwater housing for any cameras at all . I have been doing photography for over 10 years too . I followed the manual and this worked really great . No condensation . No leaks . No fuss . I 'm just amazed how the buttons are made on the exterior to work with the camera buttons . Ingenius !  
1	  For my work , I sometimes have to conduct interviews with people at their offices or in stores . Since this was going on my expense report , I didn't look up reviews and simply bought the mic at Best Buy . I was using it for a Canon mini DV camcorder and I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer here who said it was unethical for this company ( or any retailer ) to be selling this product . It makes the sound worse , simple as that . I got more static and a hollow noise and everything improved once I took the mic off . So if you think your camcorder 's mic isn't what you 'd like it to be - go ahead and buy this , get used to the horrible sound for a few weeks and then take it off . Your camcorder 's sound will sound amazing ! Seriously , don't buy this . I 'm assuming the company stays in business because they 're the only one that makes such a cheap mic and as long as they have their distribution agreements with companies like Best Buy / amazon / etc . They don't have to do spend any money on marketing or product development , just have it on the accessories shelves next to the camcorders and watch them fly off the shelves .  
1	  Not what I expected . One sheet of protective material , which did not stick very well .  
2	  I bought the original sets ( 2 ) of Pro4AA back in the ' 70s . In the 30 years or so the cushions became flat ( originals had fluid filled cushions ) and some of the connecting wires inside had become corroded . To refurb the phones I emailed Koss for replacement parts cost and was surprised to get a response to send both units to them with $ 5 for shipping and they 'll replace them under warranty . Now I have two new sets of Pro4AA ready to go another 30 years . They 're heavy compared to the new generation of light weight plastic cans , isolation pads get sticky when it 's hot , but it has the great tight bass , smooth highs , well balanced sound . Not really suited for portable use since it comes with 1/4 " plug .  
1	  It works well if there is no cordless phones ( GHz range operating ones ) in the vicinity . I tried various setup configs but gave up due to Interference and distortions . Finally I chose the phone line transmitting one ( since I had a phone line close by ) and that really helped . The model number is LF-10s made by Terk also . see its review elsewhere by me here at amazon .  
1	  I bought this SD card for 2 applications : 1 ) I am a musician who records himself and his students practicing with a " mere " digital pocket camera ( both aPanasonic Lumix DMC-TZ4K 8.1MP Digital Camera with 10x Wide Angle MEGA Optical Image Stabilized Zoom ( Black ) and aCanon PowerShot A720IS 8MP Digital Camera with 6x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom , depending on which movie format I need - this card works great in both ) set on " movie " mode . I 've reached the point where I 've needed more storage time than I had on the high-performance / speed 2GB Kingston and SanDisk cards I was using , and this card has performed remarkably well . 2 ) I also make audio-only recordings of myself , as well as rehearsals and performances of larger ensembles I play with on myZoom H2 Handy Portable Stereo Recorder , and this card should provide about 8-hours of recording time at CD quality . I tend to record at higher quality levels ( up to 96kHz , 24-bit ) , so I need more recording space than most . The device ( advertised to accept up to 16GB SD cards ) takes a while to recognize this card and to format it , but it seems to work pretty well after that . I was VERY impressed with this card , and the price is almost so low it 's scary - but I believe it 's worth it , at least for recording video . As for audio .. The biggest negative is that once it has a bunch of data on it , it takes a VERY long time to format ( also , the H2 can't recognize it - not even to reformat for its own use - if it 's been formatted for the Canon , and I haven't had this problem with other SD cards ) . I had it about 1/2 full with . avi files , and it took 15 MINUTES ( ! ) to format on a Core2 Quad Processor ( Q6600 ) with 4 GB of RAM through the computer 's media port slots ( connected via an internal USB bus ) . Most SD cards of 2GB-4GB take only a matter of SECONDS to format this way ; this card formatted in seconds also the FIRST time , but subsequent attempts have taken MUCH longer , as described above . This has me a bit nervous as to what 's going on . Is the computer having to fix data errors on the card along the way ? What 's the holdup ? I 'm concerned enough that I won't be using this card to record my more important gigs - it will remain in my case as an emergency backup . Recommended with hesitation ..  
2	  I came from a simple VCR . This is a whole new world ! I did extensive on-line research before determining this would do what I needed : Record movies to watch anytime ; make temporary recordings for viewing later ; transfer some taped material to DVD . It does it all , but it 's like getting a new computer . There are so many functions and options , that I read much of the 100-page manual , then just started experimenting with various things . I 'm still learning as I go what works best for me . Example : " Chapter Marks " are put in every 5 minutes or so on a DVD disk , but not on the hard disk .. but you can put them in yourself wherever you want . Then , if I play a disk on my computer , I can choose a scene from the pictures selected as Chapter Marks , but I can't seem to do it when playing on the JVC - maybe it 's one of numerous functions I haven't figured out yet ! On the other hand , I can start hard-disk recording with the push of a couple of buttons .. let 's say the phone rings while I 'm watching The West Wing . Then there are the disks to buy : DVD-R are the lowest price , but you can't do most editing . DVD-RW can be re-used , but cost more . DVD-RAM are even more costly , but will allow " Live Memory Playback " ( as will the hard disk ) , i.e. , watching an earlier part of a program as it 's still being recorded ( or a different program ) . One function necessary from the beginning : learning to change an " Index " , i.e. , a small picture which identifies a " title " ( one recording , such as a movie ) . Otherwise , it 's easy to have several titles on the hard disk that all show the MGM lion ! " Dubbing " ( copying ) can go in all 6 directions : tape to DVD , DVD to hard disk , etc . If I didn't need the VCR , I 'd probably get a recorder with the biggest hard disk I could find . A caution : My unit has started to act up about 3 times in 6 weeks . I shut down my computer regularly , and seem to need to do the same with the JVC . However , " off " isn't enough ; it has to be unplugged briefly . So far , it 's worked !  
2	  I purchased this trunk organizer as a Christmas gift for a friend to use in his 2004 Ford f150 . My friend seems to really like his organizer and is happy with it as a substitute for a similar unit that I use in my 2010 Ford F150 . I personally like my unknown brand organizer because mine has two dividers that separate the cargo organizer into three bins for storage . Both units fold easily to be put away behind or under the rear seat in an extended cab pickup . My friend likes that his organizer has a zippered cover while my unit does not have that feature .  
1	  Almost feel like made for children 's hands . I have reg sized women 's hands and would get cramps after using these . Have another 2 button Logitech mouse ( w / out the cute zebra stripes ) and love it so I thought I was safe in ordering these . Cannot keep . description should say they are minis . Roller is also very gravelly feeling & does not move smoothly . Returning the 2 I bought with a sad heart bc the zebra design is so darn cute . RATS ! Back to my old boring mouse ..  
1	  I was wanting a data cable to transfer music to my Zen . This is purely a power cable . You cannot transfer data with this .  
2	  This universal remote control is wonderful because of its ease of programming , versatility of programming , customization options , and especially its ease of use . Now , throw in the fact that it can work on radio-frequency and work very well , this makes it an absolutely fantastic remote ! One bad thing - the IR Emitter plugs are not universal , they are smaller in size than normal IR emitter jacks found on other brand emitters . So if you should need to replace any , it would have to be through Universal Remote Controls .  
1	  I lost the cap after 3 months . Now the drive does not work any more beause water gets into it . Other than that , its price is very competitive . From now on , I 'll buy capless USB flash drives only .  
2	  I bought this for my wife use at school . She is a teacher and has a lot of cassette teaching tapes . She asked to research for safe and good quality device . Using this Sony TCM-929 at school makes her happy . The device has nice new-days design to play old cassette tapes . It is simple , stable , and safe .  
2	  The D80 is a great camera , with which I have taken many pictures . The description here is accurate .. BUT BUT BUT-this model is superseded by the D90 in SO many ways . And for some reason , right now on Amazon , a new D90 is selling for less than this D80 . That 's insane . Everything the D80 can do , the D90 can do at least as well , and many things better , and you get video , too . Indeed , the D80 is so old now , that in many ways , lower end Nikon DSLRs are superior ( D40s , D60s , D5000s ) . The only person who should buy a D80 at this price is someone who likes to burn money . In a just and fair world , the D80 would be priced around [ .. ] bucks . Then , you 'd really have a decision to make-go with the updated D90 , for double , or get a great camera at [ .. ] . Again , it 's a great camera , but someone is ripping you off at this price .  
2	  Used this paper to create my architectural portfolio and thought the results were nice . Great resolution , nice weight , durable paper . I did have trouble after printing on the first side getting smudge marks when printing the second side , but waiting for at least 20 minutes between each print job seemed to solve this problem .  
1	  These filters are very poorly made . Out of the two that I ordered one needed to be re-soldered internally and the other disassembled and reassembled because the case improperly put together . I recommend going with the more expensive filters . Anything around ten bucks is usually pretty good . Dont try to save money by giving yourself this headache . It also did not help whatsoever with the noise on my CB from my trucks fuel pump .  
1	  Using the two included Panasonic alkaline batteries the unit came from , I ran out of juice after taking a dozen pictures and transferring one ( as test ) to my computer . My old , battered , taped-together Nikon Coolpix 5200 ( does everybody have trouble with broken battery doors on Coolpix units ? ) * never * gave me a low-battery warning . The rechargeable battery seems to run forever - I recharge it " preventatively " every 5-6 weeks ! The Samsung may be OK for the money in other respects , but this kind of power management snafu pretty much turned me off the brand altogether .  
2	  This product will forever change the way you watch TV . Suddenly , you are in complete control of what you watch and when . I don't watch less TV , but I do watch the TV that I want to watch . I wouldn't recommend this for someone who isn't somewhat comfortable with technology . And yes , it does crash at times , but the benefits far outweigh the inconvenience . Purchase at least 80 hours of storage time if you plan to record on medium quality which I recommend . The commercial skip feature is great . Ok .. it isn't perfect , but it is by far the best available . This feature will be GOING AWAY with the introduction of the 5500 series due to pressure from the entertainment industry . Take a look at the article below . - ReplayTV has agreed to remove two features from its product that infuriated the ad and broadcasting industries even more than they delighted consumers . ReplayTV 's new 5500 model , on sale next month , has been re-engineered so that it cannot automatically skip entire commercial breaks without recording them . Nor will it be able to send recorded programming over the internet to other ReplayTV users outside a home network . But the devices will still indefinitely store many hours of programming , while enabling users to skip manually in 30-second segments through recorded commercials . Two years ago , a consortium of movie and TV studios sued Sonicblue & # 65533 ; the former owner of ReplayTV and now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection & # 65533 ; for abetting copyright infringement with the device & # 65533 ; s commercial-skipping feature . The company and its technology was subsequently acquired by D & M ; Holdings of Japan . D & M ; executives insist that the dropping of these features was voluntary , although critics see the move as capitulation rather than an accommodation . Jim Hollingsworth , president of D & M ; & # 65533 ; s ReplayTV division , denies this . & # 65533 ; We did this on our own . There was no coercion . We will take features out because we want to be a positive force in the industry . & # 65533 ; But Jeff Joseph , vp and spokesman for the Consumer Electronics Association , is not convinced : & # 65533 ; Companies are under considerable pressure to bow to the wishes of the entertainment industry . This is unfair and anticompetitive . If advertisers and broadcasters are seeing their traditional business model threatened , then it would behoove them to consider alternative business models . & # 65533 ;  
2	  I am a hardcore gamer . I sometimes play games 12 hours at a time . This mouse is excellent for gaming , I have big hands and it fits perfect . It is also beautiful to look at . I use a Func Surface Mouse Pad and usually use teflon tape on my mouse feet . This mouse feels so good I haven't even put any on yet . I like the feet , they are very small and there are 5 instead of the usual 4 for extra smooth sliding . The fact that they are so small will save on the expensive teflon feet tape too :) The mouse is very light , I really cannot find anything bad to say about it . The only thing in question in my book is how long it will last and it seems built well so I expect to be happy a while :) Highly recommended .  
2	  it is a good choice for your 6 bucks . Just buy it ! Good enough for me !  
1	  I am on my third drive . Maxtor was quick about replacing the drives , but I am not happy with the quality of this drive . This expensive drive was to be used for archiving all my digital media from family photos , movies , music .. But I cannot say that I have much faith in the job its suppose to do . This third drive while asleep , flashing its annoying light that states its in sleep mode . Heck , if this were in my bedroom , the drive would be the only thing sleeping ! As I was saying .. while sleeping the mount will drop from my desktop and the annoying light stops functioning . The only way to resurrect it is to turn it off unplug everything from it and start over . I 'm not sure if this is what its suppose to do , since the instructions / manual are so weak . I 'm thinking about buying a SATA case and putting these drives inside that and throw away the maxtor case . What a waste .  
2	  I got this charger for less than $ 5 , shipping included . It works fine on my iPod Nano ( 3rd generation ? ) and is way cheaper than the alternatives out there . Highly recommended !  
1	  Left earbud failed within 10 hours of use ; buds would not stay inserted in my ( admittedly small ) ear canals , so they were worthless for exercising ; sound not any better than basic buds anyway . Don't bother with these .
