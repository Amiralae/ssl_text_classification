1	  Guys and Dolls is a movie itching for a remake . It was made forty-eight years ago . Its two main stars are either dead or 409 pounds . Although a remake , with big stars now , would be box-office success , it would not be able to capture the magic that went into this version . Its boundless energy can't be recaptured , nor can the pure joy you get when watching something like this : a huge , widescreen , big entertainment movie . Marlon Brando ( who last clocked in at 409 lbs . last time I heard ) plays Sky Masterson , one of the biggest gamblers in New York . Frank Sinatra is Nathan Detroit , whose as often as he can find a speakeasy for it crap game is city-wide famous . However , when the one place he has left to hold it is charging $ 1,000 , Detroit needs the money fast . He bets Masterson $ 1,000 that he can't take missionary Sarah Brown ( Jean Simmons ) to Havana with him the next day . Guys and Dolls is basically nothing more than unsavory types singing and dancing , which usually , as it does here , add up to fun . It 's obvious to see how this was a Broadway musical : there weren't that many sets , and the scenes were long . If I was to complain about one thing , it 's how uneven the songs were . At times , there were two songs in a scene ; other times , thirty minutes went by without one . Guys and Dolls is never boring , just a great time . My rating : 8/10 Not Rated .  
1	  This is quite a dull movie . Well-shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from Depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and art-house connotations all over , it fails because the director takes no position , stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates . One of France 's revered and regular working partner on films with Depardieu - I believe they made 7 together - Pialat fails to engage . It seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good-hearted husband around . Isabelle Hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like " I don't know " ; " I like his arms " ; " I like the way he makes love " to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because .. I assume he loves her . So he accepts and hope for what ? That she will one day wake up and come to her senses . Things like this are not answered in Pialat 's condescending docu-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up . I know the answers do not add up but please take a stand . Jules et Jim , this is not . The final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving .  
0	  It 's interesting how 90 % of the high-vote reviews are all comprised of " * random username * " from " United States " ( no state pride ? ) who all say more or less the exact same thing with the exact same grammatical style and all with the exact same complete lack of taste in movies . I would delve further into this suspicious trend , but alas , this is a review of the movie , and not the reviews themselves . Let me start by saying that I am both a Christian and a true avid movie fan . This means I have seen a great many movies , from good to bad , and can wholeheartedly claim that Facing The Giants is , in fact , NOT a good movie . It has good intentions , but fails to meet many ( if any ) basic standards that I associate with a quality filmgoing experience . The Acting : Mostly Terrible , Palatable At Best . Hearing that most were apparently volunteers does not at all surprise me . The Dialogue : Clumsy , cheesy , the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit you 'd see performed in Sunday School or youth group function . The Rave Review Robots revel in the absence of " meaningless words " , but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world , and the complete absence of it is palpable . Let 's just say the mean ol ' head coach of a team in a State Championship game would have a lot more to say than " OH NO ! " when things are not going his way . The Plot : Mind-bogglingly predictable . It has been commented that this movie is " not a Hollywood cliché " , and yet it 's like it was pulled directly from Making An Underdog Sports Movie For Dummies ( including the mandatory quasi-romantic subplot for the ladies ) and just had a Christian-themed coat of paint slapped on it . I 'm not lying or bragging when I say I had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot pegged immediately upon their inception . Only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally stirred by the story presented here . The Directing / Editing : It , too , was patterned almost exactly after the generic Underdog Sports Movie template . Still , acting aside , there weren't many noticeable goofs , so at least Facing The Giants was technically competent . The Message : Ask Jesus and He will grant all your wishes . Part of me hoped that this movie would end in the team 's eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole " If we lose , we praise You " part , because in the Real World , you WILL fail at one point or another and it 's good to be prepared for that . But in the world of Facing The Giants , if you fail , clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating . Another interesting question being , what if the Eagles came across another team that had gotten religion ? Would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and last-minute saves , or would the universe simply have exploded ? The Bottom Line : For the hardcore conservative Christian Parents crowd lamenting the evils of Hollywood , Facing The Giants will be another mediocre-at-best Christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern film-making . For everyone else , the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else . And a warning : Any attempt to show this to non-Christians will lead not to conversion , but to derision . I give this two stars , one for the one scene that did not have me rolling my eyes , and another for basic technical proficiency on a low budget .  
0	  I 'm dumbfounded . Yes that 's right . I 'm really caught here . No way did I find it awful , but on the other hand it was a frustrating experience in macabre hysterical and murky incoherency . The idea behind such a trim , minimal low-budget Indie production isn't bad , but it 's a confused muddle and in the end didn't do anything for me . It 's amateurish and simple ; it wants to exploit beyond reasoning and do so in that of-late fashionably rapid filming style . We have the documentary laced ( hand-held ) camera moving everywhere ( despite never leaving the van ) , and sometimes feeling unfocused and blurry making certain details hard to figure out . Lately you kind of get use to it , but there are times when it does become too distracting and even nauseating . Keeping it still will help . The context has little groundwork ( which has five teenage girls on their way home from a football game late at night and becoming lost on the back roads . At a road-side store they become involved in a minor accident which smashes an unoccupied SUV headlight . Scared , they flee and not too long that one-light SUV appears behind them . Soon to make their night an unforgettable ordeal in terror ) spending most of the time playing out a drawn out , noisy and relentless cat and mouse game . As for being disturbing I guess that depends . Some moments can make you squirm with its attention to pain , desperation and demented brutality ( with good use of piercing sound FX that seem to be more favoured over the imagery and not forgetting the alienating background sound effects ) , but also I found myself snickering too . In passages it can be repellent and intense with a real gradual rush , but hardly believable . The injuries of random characters never seem as serious like you were to believe , despite obviously they should be . Watch how blood runs freely , but it 's not entirely convincing and can get dull . The constant nocturnal car chase could only do so much before getting repetitive . We get screaming , spewing , bleeding , running , cursing , body fluids and so on . Quite unpleasant details followed too . With little really to do , it needed a much stronger script than the measly forced one that was penned up . Too many cringe-moments arose from it , and there was not much in the way of depth for the characters and situation they were in . It was about set-pieces , waiting for next torturous encounter and it drew it out long enough . Helping out is it had an unpredictable pattern . The performances ; Jennifer Barnett , Angela Brunda , Danielle Lilley , Sandra Paduch and Mia Yi are workman-like with their distraught characters and draw an authentic chemistry to make up for the script 's weaknesses in its character-foundation . Veronica Garcia 's flipped-out , bug-eyed intensity as the loony driver of the SUV was something yeah something . Her character 's real motivation for terrorising the girls and her unstable state of mind is virtually non-existent . I guess being psychotic was good enough . Now probably the most unnerving thing I came across in the feature was that hideous soundtrack . Terrible techno music , to cheesy hard-rock and an overwrought closing score . It never felt overdone or got in the way , but it did stick out like a sore thumb . Co-directors Greg Swinson and Ryan Thiessen try to get the most out of their slight resources , but even with it edgy spirit it ends up being something quite ramshackle . Maybe it was enjoyable to make , but watching it just wasn't the case .  
0	  This movie was rented by a friend . Her choice is normally good . I read the cover first and was expecting a good movie . Although it was a horror movie . Which i don't prefer . But no horror came to mind while watching the movie . It was a dull , not very entertaining movie . The appearance of Denise Richards was again a pleasure for the eye . But that 's it . We ( the four of us ) we 're a little bit disappointed . But feel free to see this movie and judge it yourself .  
1	  At least for a half hour a week . I haven't been interested in anything on the big 3 networks ( ABC / CBS / NBC ) in years . All of the lions are interesting , although Larry can get annoying at times . I really like the Middle earth action figures they bring in with Hunter . Most of the other characters are interesting as well . The sideshow of Siegfried and Roy is entertaining at times , too . The animation is top notch , and definitely the best CG that has been done on a weekly TV show . Usually when they hire big names to star in a show , they 're trying to hide a poor script or characters . Not entirely true in this show though , There 's a couple characters that were weak and improved by the voice acting , but overall the characters stand on their own . This is definitely for 16 and up . There 's nothing here that most kids haven't already heard before though , and most of the jokes would probably just fly right over their heads . It 's definitely not as crude and edgy as South Park , but does bring some of the same " Bash everyone " feel to it . One example is that it makes fun of both Dick Cheney and Barbara Streisand at the same time in one episode . Father of the Pride and other Dreamworks productions like Shrek also feel like the spiritual successors of Animaniacs , Pinky and the Brain , and Freakazoid . It 's the same type of humor grown up . It may not be as witty as Spielberg 's classic TV series , but it 's still good . I hope that it finishes this season off well , and is renewed for future seasons . Otherwise I may never find a reason to watch the big 3 again .  
1	  Ok , first I have to point the fact that when I first saw this flick I was 9 years old . If I had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time , I´d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply made cable TV horror film with some well-made scenes . But when you´re nine you just don´t care about those facts . This scared the hell out of me back then , especially those aforementioned Zelda - scenes ( and they still do ) . Nowadays I´m kind of hooked to this film . I have to see this maybe once in a month , and on every new year´s eve I watch this with a 12-pack of beer & bunch of friends . It´s like an appetizer for a good party ! I kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense . Midkiff and Crosby do look like I wanted Louis and Rachel look like , but one can´t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two . Hughes and Gwynne pretty much save the scenes which " the Creeds " underact . What I actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to Pet Sematary , and I don´t mean the zombie stuff here . THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CERTAINLY A NOVELTY AND ONE OF A KIND . Honestly , how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable-TV one , but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror-chillers out there ? Alright I busted some of the cast´s balls a minute ago , but I have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection . But hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to Pet Sematary ! I really would love to know .. And I don´t mean night of the living dead here .. this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff .  
0	  My friend 's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out , so when she brought home The Convent , a horror movie , i couldn't wait to watch it . Given that it 's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious , I can say that in some weird way , I like this movie . yes , the acting is bad , and yes , it 's the cheapest movie i 've ever seen , but it 's so damn funny ! " WHAT , ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK ? ! " i didn't know this movie even was ever released .. i figured it was too bad .. Yeah , so .. overall the movie is pretty bad ( you gotta admit that much at least ) but I promise you , you will get a good laugh out of it . * this movie kinda sucks but it 's good for a laugh .. especially that guy that holds the ' dagger of despair ' .. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAIR !  
0	  I am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators . To me it was rather a disappointment , especially the combination of historical facts , fantasy and the main character 's internal turmoil does not work at all ( in Vonnegut 's book Slaughterhouse Five and even in George Roy Hill 's adaptation for the screen it does ) . Credibility is often overstretched . Too many questions are left open . Did I miss some central points ? Or did I fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots ? A boy called Campbell , Jr. , grows up in upstate New York . At home his father has many technical trade papers and one book . It has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it . The boy leafs through the book , his dad doesn't like his doing that . What should this tell me ? The family moves away from upstate New York to Berlin . BANG . It is 1938 , the boy is a married man in Berlin and a theater playwright . What kind of plays does he write ? In what language ? Is he successful ? His wife is an actress and looks glamorous . The parents move back to the USA and invite their son to do the same . He does not . Why ? Because having grown up in Germany he feels more German than American ? Because he is successful ? Because his wife is ? Because he likes his life there ? Because he likes the Nazis ? Because he is just plain lazy and doesn't like change ? Don't ask me . Possibly , the man just does not care , is not interested in politics , is a kind of an existentialist . He states that he is deeply in love with his wife . He speaks of his Republic of Two ( meaning he and his wife ) . There is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie , it much more seems a Republic of One . On the request of an American agent Campbell , Jr. , agrees to broadcast anti Semitic Nazi hate propaganda to American listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to American authorities who read between the lines . The crucial meeting with the agent on a Berlin park bench is short , unexciting and anti climactic , the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation , the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast . So now we have Campbell , Jr. , presenting himself over the air as the Last Free American . The scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting - although one wonders what happened when Campbell , Jr. , really and honestly had to cough , hiccup etc . ( must have scrambled the messages terribly ) . Anyway , the Nazis lose , the wife dies ( touring in the Crimean for German troops - I never heard such tours really happened on German front lines in WW II ) , Campbell , Jr. , says he goes to the Russian front but does not go , is captured by an American soldier who recognizes his mug ( how come ? ) , is dragged to a sight-seeing tour in Auschwitz , is then released and resettled with the help of the Crucial Agent somewhere in the City of New York . AND THIS IS WHERE THE STORY REALLY STARTS BANG . From now on it is like a short story by Paul Auster . It is 1961 , Campbell , Jr. , lives in New York tenement as a has-been and mourns the loss of his wife . Nobody really cares - or do they ? Yes , somehow they do , and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction . Auschwitz survivors . A painter . Some American supremacists discover " him and want him to be their figurehead . They even find his presumed dead wife for him , or is she his wife ? Anyway , in the end Campbell , Jr. , calls in at the Israeli consulate , and they obligingly give him the Big War Criminal treatment , placing him in the cell adjacent to Adolf Eichmann 's . He writes his life story and , once this task finished , hangs himself on the typewriter 's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit . While I can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss , I just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone . So I found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss . Amazingly , many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero , having put his reputation at stake for playing the Last Free American . I assume according to them this took a lot of courage . As a matter of fact , however , the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment Campbell created for himself a win-win situation , as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war . The danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story . One might argue , that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything . But even then it fails to make a point , primarily , I suspect , because the love affair in the Republic of Two falls completely flat . This is a pity , especially if you consider that the wife was played by Sheryl Lee , a talented , versatile and sensuous actress . She has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous German accent . Another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts ( confession , broadcast and hidden messages ) , but I guess this is largely unfilmable . Maybe I should give the book a chance .  
1	  Just like Final Fantasy brought CG to a whole new level , this is a rebirth for motion capture . Neither movie nor cartoon , this motion picture looks like a homage to the Film Noir , Akira , Sin City , Blade Runner and the new generation of European cartoonists . You see Paris the way it almost could be , the characters seem as real as you and I. They blink , trip , shiver like real actors in a way never achieved before . Don't go watch it hoping to find a mind twister . You will most likely figure it out before you 're half way from the movie . The scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to famous thrillers , but this definitely is bliss for the eyes .  
1	  People don't seem to be giving Lensman enough credit where its due . A few issues have been overlooked which are key to understanding the Lensman experience . The Year : For the year it was made in ( 1984 ) Lensman features some of the most stunning effects I 've ever seen . As a person who watches a lot of early 80 's animation Lensman is unique in it 's use of what appears to be computer-generated imagery at a time when computers were extremely primitive . Kim 's battle against the geometric cutter pods in the laser maze can be taken as an excellent example of this . Every time I watch that I have to keep repeating to myself that it was 1984 when it was made . The Soundtrack : Lensman has one of the most insane soundtracks that I 've heard , and this mad hysterical beat permeates every corner of the film . Lensman borrowed heavily on two western mistakes and managed to somewhat deal with the first one - the need to fill in every second of silence in a film with music and the need for a heroine . While the music is attuned well and galvanizes scenes such as the motorcycle battle in the Thionite Factory on Radelyx , the heroine theme fails due to the sheer annoyance value of Chris . It 's interesting to note that the constant music thwarted my attempts at noise removal when I was archiving lensman over from analog tape to digital format - since there wasn't a single second of silence available to use as a reference point . Western Influences : Helmut - sounds like " helmet " and has roughly the same voice as Darth Vader . Clarissa Fairborn - has the same hairstyle as the princess of SW and her name sounds suspiciously similar to Marissa Fairborn of Transformers . Takes over Han Solos role by flying the ship and having some technical expertise . Buzzkirk - a definite improvement on Chewbaka . The lens - a nice concrete copy of the force that comes across less as a chance to preach Christianity at the audience than in the original SW . While the force relied on belief far more than concentration , the lens is a pure concentration tool . Theoretically , anyone could wield the lens . The lens is far more limited than the Force - being purely a defensive / offensive weapon . Technology : The boskone alliance have interesting meatball sponge ships . They look like stormtroopers only with red uniforms instead of white . The idea of a DNA weapon was nice if only it had been developed . The Galactic Alliance looked like Starblazers ( or whatever it was called - that 60 's series where they were battling the Xylons ) . There weren't enough ship to ship battles for me - this is much improved upon in the second Lensman film . Finally a note on Worzel . This character is a unique and very interesting character-design who fortunately continues on to the second film .  
0	  I watched this movie and the original Carlitos Way back to back . The difference between the two is disgusting . Now i know that people are going to say that the prequel was made on a small budget but that never had anything to do with a bad script . Now maybe it 's just me , but i always thought that a prequel was made to go set up the other movie , starring key characters and maybe filling in a bit about life that we didn't know . Rise to Power is just a movie that has Carlito 's name . There should have been at least a few characters from the original movie , the ending makes no sense in relation to the original . In the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie ? And his woman isn't even the same woman that he talks about as his only love in the original . I would say the movie is mildly entertaining in its self , with a few decent bits but it pales when held up to it 's big brother . Don't lay awake at night waiting to see this , watch the original one more time if you really need a hit .  
0	  Tim ( Gary Daniels ) wants desperately to break into serious television reporting . When a job he begged for goes awry , he is fired . His beautiful but empty girlfriend ( Elizabeth Hurley ) says sayonara , too . Coming home , Tim is startled to discover his house has an uninvited visitor ( Christopher Lloyd ) from the planet Mars ! Calling him Uncle Martin , Tim soon tries to help his new friend navigate life on earth . But , Martin gets in trouble wherever he goes , from the bathroom to the laundry room and more . Lovely Lizzie ( Daryl Hannah ) finally sees an opportunity to make time with Tim but the course of true love does not run smooth in this case , either . Soon everyone in television is stalking Tim , hoping for a story about a true alien . What 's a man to do ? For those who loved the old television show of the same name , with Bill Bixby and Ray Walston , this film is not worthy to tie the proverbial boots . Its truly , undeniably awful , with no plot and a reliance on supposed special effects which fall flat , too . Daniels is okay as the earthling but Lloyd is simply terrible as the alien , overacting up a storm . The rest of the cast is adequate , as are the costumes , set , and production details . Even if your children see the cover and beg for this film , convince them to pick out another flick at the video store . Be assured , kids and adults will find this movie a colossal bore , so opt for A Night at the Museum or Around the World in 80 Days instead .  
1	  I suppose the ultimate curse of attending the Toronto Film Festival is your release date time table get messed up . Quite frankly , I 'm just happy Fido got picked up for US distribution . In any case .. Ever seen Shaun of the Dead ? Good . How about Lassie ? Able to reconcile the two ? Well , if you can your name might be Andrew Currie , Canadian helmer of the first ever family themed zombie comedy , or zomedy . ( Seriously , that 's what the press book in Toronto called it . ) Though not as violent , dry , or British as Shaun of the Dead , Fido remains true to its roots : a devotion to old 50s black and white television including both Lassie and the infamous sci-fi pulp that was being pumped out during the period . Fido 's talented headliners ( Carrie Anne Moss , Billy Connelly , Dylan Baker , and Tim Blake Nelson ) stand as a testament to the brilliance of the script . The film explores all the implications of its premise : a world where zombies have been converted to servants because of the sheer number of them due to a strange accident . What would you use your new undead servant for ? A butler ? Manual labor ? A pet ? Unspeakable acts ? Fido tackles all these possibilities in a sweet and surprisingly classy way , with much thanks to the work of Connelly ( as one of said zombies ) and young TV actor K'Sun Ray , who seems at times to be a better young Elijah Wood than the young Elijah Wood was . If you 're expecting another Shaun of the Dead , don't waste your time . There 's not nearly enough gore and pokes at the genre to satisfy you and you 'll just leave the theater bitter and depressed . But if you 're willing to take a look at what happens to Shaun of the Dead when it jumps across the lake , you 're in for a treat . Think of Fido as the sensitive , more often beaten up little brother to Shaun of the Dead 's rebellious loser , and you 're starting to get the drift . If you like ( or at least tolerate ) zombies , small children , and loads of deadpan satire , Fido 's the film for you . If that 's not the case .. well , you know the drill . Just hit ' em square between the eyes .  
1	  This is one of the few comedies I can watch again and again and still laugh out loud . In other places , I have read complaints about racism and sexism from sanctimonious , politically correct prigs . There is neither here , unless you define sexism as a woman as housewife and racism as a family employing a colored maid . The lines are hilarious , and all the leads have never been better . Melvin Douglas is especially brilliant . If you 've ever thought of or tried to build a new house , you will be relieved to know that no matter how infuriating the process , no matter how much a lamb among wolves you may feel , you are not alone !  
1	  As the celebration of Christmas has evolved through the years , whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions , it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other . That has somehow slipped past one Ebenezer Scrooge , merchant and money lender in 19th century London . As his nephew points out to his uncle , he doesn't keep Christmas in any way because Scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug . The humanity in Scrooge was driven out long ago , he 's a hard case , a whole lot like his 20th Century counterpart , Mr. Potter of Bedford Falls , New York . But as Charles Dickens told this tale , redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit Scrooge and show him how . A Christmas Carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century Great Britain as Oliver Twist was . The characters in this film are middle and lower class . The Cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in Oliver Twist , but they are having to struggle to stay up there . Still love and happiness radiate their home , no thanks to the guy Bob Cratchit works for . Like George Bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much , Ebenezer Scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world . Patrick Stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of Scrooge . But George C. Scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film . The meanness of him , but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change . Scott joins a fine tradition of people like Reginald Owen and Alastair Sim who 've both done great interpretations of Scrooge . Among the supporting roles I particularly enjoyed David Warner as Bob Cratchit and Edward Woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of Christmas present . According to IMDb this is one of 32 versions of A Christmas Carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best .  
1	  This is a comedy based on national stereotypes , no doubt . If you leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are , if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions , you can have fun with this film . Nicole Kidman is at her best , sexy , moving and funny . Ben Chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out-shadowed by Nicole , and the rest of the cast does good work as well . The final is moving , and logical - movie logics , of course . Worth watching , if you accept the rules of the game .  
1	  Honestly , I was expecting to HATE this one , and really only checked it out because Jenna Jameson is in it .. but I have to say I got a kick out of EVIL BREED . A group of college kids and their teacher go on a " field trip " to Ireland . Their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace . The group of post-teens is warned by the property 's caretaker not to venture into the woods - but being the stupid B-movie characters that they are - of course they pay no attention and pay for their mistake one-by-one .. First off , there is plenty wrong with EVIL BREED . The acting / dialog is pretty weak , and my major gripe is that a film that has Jenna Jameson , Chasey Lain , Ginger Lynn , and Taylor Hayes should have FAR more gratuitous nudity than was on display here - and Jenna 's role in this production is grossly over-hyped , as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time . Even less with Chasey , and Ginger Lynn shows no skin and has the worst Irish accent ever . Also the last scene of the film makes absolutely no sense and feels like it 's thrown in just to end the film . Those gripes aside - there is some good stuff as well . Richard Greico and Chasey Lain are both dispatched early on , with Greico 's nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and Chasey 's guts hanging out from being torn in half ( though how she ends up this way isn't shown on-screen ) .. not bad for the first 5 minutes . The other kill scenes are pretty inventive , including Jenna 's forced breast implant removal , a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass , a knife through the face , and a few other notables . The implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it 's a shame the producers made them chop ' em , so to speak . Also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don't really have too much time to be bored . The " creature " FX are also done competently which definitely helps . Overall , EVIL BREED was not NEARLY as bad as I expected . This one , along with SATAN 'S LITTLE HELPER have ALMOST renewed my interest in American low-budget straight-to-video films . I usually steer clear of them as a whole , but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith . EVIL BREED is no masterpiece , but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes - might not hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you 're at it - I know I was , and I 'm sure it didn't hurt the experience . 7.5/10  
1	  I can't believe others took such a serious view of all this . God , it was a lot of fun rooting for Hop-a-long Cassidy . It was a great tribute to the Western serials of years ago . It wasn't meant to be a great cinema experience , except it was . So what if there wasn't a big special effects bonanza . It was a fun , tongue in cheek , look at old Western 's . Man , relax and enjoy .  
0	  Usually , any film with Sylvester Stallone is usually going to suck ass . Rambo : First Blood Part II was no exception to this . The only movies that Sylvester Stallone were in that were good were Rocky and First Blood . This film is extreamly unrealistic , and boring . It has action , but not very good action . I didn't enjoy watching it , and I would never ever watch this again . No wonder why it won the Razzie Award for Worst Picture . I would give this a 3/10 , the only reason why it got the 3 was because it had somewhat good action , but not good enough .  
0	  Last night I decided to watch the prequel or shall I say the so called prequel to Carlito 's Way - " Carlito 's Way : Rise to Power ( 2005 ) " which went straight to DVD .. no wonder .. it completely .. and I mean completely S % & KS ! waist of time watching it and I think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it .. I don't understand how De Palma agreed on producing this sh # t-fest of a movie .. except for only one fact that I tip my hat to .. Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante .. reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II .. but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it ! Jay Hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino .. too bad for him I don't think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after I watched this sh # $ % ty movie , I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get the bad taste out of my mouth .  
0	  I normally only write reviews for movies I really hated or really liked . And , as you can probably tell from the number of stars up there , I didn't like it . By now , I assume you have read about the plot or maybe even seen the movie , so I 'll skip the summary . Let 's break this down , pros and cons : Cons : The concept : The premise was set up to be interesting . Using Chaos theory as a theme was interesting . However , it wasn't carried out so well . Correct me if I 'm wrong , but it seems to me that Chaos theory was kind of misrepresented . The event that occurred in the movie seemed more like contrived coincidence than anything . I guess the Butterfly effect was represented by the whole " God ( s ) causes Tsunami to bring back statue . " The presentation comes off as really sloppy though . Some people call this intelligent , but it just seems to be another souped up action film . Storyline : Is it just me , or does it seem that Kamal just threw this together to give him an excuse to play ten roles ? The plot is extremely contrived ; Govind kept losing the vial so many times in obscure accidents ( his friend just happens to mix up the vial with a package he was sending to India , a crazy old lady just happens to throw the vial into an idol , half the cast just happens to unexpectedly meet up in the same hospital , and the case with the idol just happened to get mixed up with one that belonged to a famous singer . ) CGI : Oh god , the CGI . It was even worse than the special effects in Jaws 3 , and those sucked . Right away , I could tell which parts were animated . Even my ten-year-old cousin knows that underwater cars don't look like that . Stunts : Yes , I now that action scenes in Tamil movies aren't realistic , but the stunts in this one were horrid and actually distracted me from the story . Make up : I have to admit , they did a better job than expected . I thought Kamal would be playing people with similar skin tones , so the two fake white guys and the fake Japanese Aikido guy caught me off guard . However , it was still pretty bad , I could easily tell which ones were wearing masks . The songs : The music was distracting and out-of-place in many instances . Asin : Her character was possibly the most annoying one in the movie . She was loud , ditsy , and obsessed irrationally about that idol . I actually found myself wishing she would die . Plot holes and Fridge Logic : Let me get this straight : a lab monkey was smart enough to get past a password-locked door , but not intelligent enough to tell the difference between a bar of chocolate and a vial with a deadly virus in it . And then , an ex-CIA agent who 's after the vial figures out it 's headed for India . Instead of immediately following it , he marries a pole dancer first . A famous Punjabi singer with cancer checks into a small town hospital in the third world when he could easily afford the best medical treatment available . Furthermore , he gets shot in the throat with a bullet . You 'd think he would be killed , but instead , the magic bullet has cleared his tumor . You read that right , a BULLET knocked out the tumor . Pros .. The Naidu Character : Possibly the only likable part of the movie was his comedy .  
1	  This is a wonderfully written and well acted psychological drama . It is not really a horror flick so those looking for something like The Ring or The Grudge will be disappointed . What really surprised me about this film was the intelligence and subtle attention to detail in the plot and the effort made to be internally consistent . I also appreciated the absence of Dr. Phil psychobabble or New Age revisionism . Rather than advancing an agenda , the filmmakers just told the story , told it well and let the viewer think about it . The sparse dreamscapes were reminiscent of Wyeth paintings and amazingly effective . A great example of how to make a good film on a small budget , without big studios , star actors , big-name directors ( this was far better than many of Hitchcock 's films ) , special effects or " clever " plot twists .  
1	  I can only echo the praise of the other reviews here . It 's a delightful film with a feelgood factor that it achieves without crossing the line into soppy sentimentality . Naturally sweet - no added sugar . One small point : it seems to me that the mild objections raised about Ustinov 's character Pendelton being able to walk in and defeat the system security ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly a genius / savant at this sort of thing . Yes , the film was pretty computer illiterate , but it did show Pendelton ' studying computers ' at his flat , and I believe the implication was supposed to be that his gifts allowed him to simply engulf the whole subject , practically overnight . There were a few odd moments when it appeared in some scenes that Gnatpole was trying to test Pendelton 's knowledge and call his bluff . I 'm not sure whether we were supposed to believe that Pendelton cunningly weaselled his way out of these situations , or whether he was actually knowledgeable enough to pass the tests - it was a little unclear . Certainly he had to know enough to set up the dummy accounts . Presumably Wallach and Ustinov were relying on their own rather foggy notion of how computers worked in those days , and in order to understand in detail what they were getting at , it 's necessary to know quite what their concept was . They knew there was something about ' procedures ' which was important ; they thought that the ' smart light ' could actually control security , rather than just indicate its state ; they thought that the ( dumb ) user terminal 's features would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself - though apart from things like graphics feature I don't see it meself . Mostly , I think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as far as they could , and they did that rather well . Allowing them a bit of artistic license , I don't think their efforts had any flaws worthy of note . CD  
1	  This film is to my mind the weakest film in the original Star Wars trilogy , for a variety of reasons . However it emerges at the end of the day a winner , despite all its flaws . It 's still a very good film , even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments . One problem here is the look of the film , which isn't very consistent with the other 2 films . I put a lot of that down to the departure of producer Gary Kurtz . The first 2 films have that dirty , lived-in look with all the technology and so forth . In " Jedi " on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned . This makes for a much less textured film . Also the creatures were excessively muppet-like and cutesy . At this point it seems like the film-makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself . Another aspect is its lack of originality . Where " Star Wars " created a whole new experience in cinema and " Empire " brought us to alien worlds of swamps , ice , and clouds , " Jedi " lamely re-cycled the locations of the first film . First we are back on the desert planet Tatooine , and then we are watching them face ANOTHER death star ( maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new .. but you 'd think Lucas or Kasdan could ) . Also we have these ewoks , who really are just detestable made-for-mattel teddy bears , in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie-fight at the end of " Star Wars " if they hadn't run out of cash . It just feels like lazy construction . The most unfortunate aspect of " Jedi " for me is the weak handling of the Han Solo character . Whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time , trading one liners with the droids . Instead of a real drama we 're stuck with the lame pretense that Han is still convinced Leia loves Luke - as if the conclusion of " Empire " where she confessed her love of him had never happened . The whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the Solo character was not part of this film 's central story after his rescue . Ford , for his part , looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances . This is more like a 1990s Ford performance , bored and looking " above " the film itself . Fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes . Lando , an interesting character introduced in " Empire " , here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle . Only Hamill , given an interesting development in the Luke character , is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character . Probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work . And to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters . Really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package . Ian McDiarmid does excellent work as well as the Emperor . The film would sink if he had been too far over the top ( as he was at times in the new films ) . Visually and in terms of effects work , other than the " clean " look of everything it 's hard to find fault . Jabba is a very effective animatronic character , one of the most elaborate ever constructed . The space battles towards the end are very impressive . Ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears . But on its own , it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and IMHO far superior to any of Lucas ' later productions .  
0	  In the Fiji islands , the greedy and unscrupulous owner of the Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and guests for an opening party of his compound composed of hotel and zoo aiming to find partners for his discoveries . When a bunch of college smalltime thieves puts a virus in the security system to participate in a scavenger hunt , the greatest attractions of the zoo  sabretoothes from the prehistoric age developed from DNA found in fossils  escape , killing the hosts and guards for pleasure . The incredibly lame and cheap " Attack of the Sabretooth " is one of the worst movies I have recently seen . The characters are awful and not funny or pleasant and the story is a terrible Jurassik Park rip-off with a bad collection of clichés . Basically all the lines and situations are poor and stupid , but the winner is when the guard explains that the sabretoothes are bulimic and like to kill for pleasure . My vote is three . Title ( Brazil ) : " O Ataque do Dente de Sabre " ( " The Attack of the Sabretooth " )  
1	  actually .. that " video camera " effect , is just that , it 's an effect , a rather good one .. ( u don't know much about directing a film do you ? ) this film is in fact BETTER than the original , it 's great fun to watch , made for TV , doesn't need to follow any rules . I find it hard to watch number 1 because of how he kills the first girl , its disturbing . and all the time we are routing for Judd Nelson to get away with it , we as the viewers are on his side . i hope one day we will see a 3rd cabin by the lake but i doubt it . Watching this film you can understand how real movies are made , as this is sort of like a film within a film . Judd is one of the scariest villains ever , and he 's more realistic , he doesn't just mindlessly chop people up like in other horrors .  
0	  honestly , i don't know what 's funnier , this horrific remake , or the comments on this board . Masterpiece 's review had me in tears , that 's so funny . Anyway , this movie is the among the worst movies ever , and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels . The " Omen " name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on HBO , but it 's a slap in the face to the other three , especially the original . There are so many classically bad moments , but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair ! good times ! This movie is to the Omen series what " Scary Movie " is to the entire genre . Avoid unless you 're looking for a good laugh .  
0	  I live in Ottawa where this film was made and I really wish it hadn't been . This is one God-awful flick . I really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is : Indie Films Blow . Well , this film does nothing to shed this curse . The actor , writer , director Brett Kelly does little to contribute to the genre , rather he re-hashes tired clichés from movies past . I am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting , it 's way too overdone . I can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights . Now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension , but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie . As well for a movie that dares to call itself horror , a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore , other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring . The biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development , the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this Bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back . Not that this concept bugs me , but , I didn't really find it believable that when the two main characters , both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other . This is done in such a short time span that it 's inconceivable , my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her . The last point that I have is .. and I won't hold this against Kelly , but the movie is shot entirely on boring , emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film . Although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat . My only hope is that something happens to prevent Brett Kelly from making a sequel , which has been reported on his website , a sequel that was half written in one sitting . Lord help us all .  
0	  This was a watershed event in my movie watching life . I went to see this in the theater when it came out . I was completely amazed at just how bad it was . Movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very , very large favor . The special effects are absolutely first grade level , as in any first grader could have done them . Toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings , arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you 'd find on a street sign , and a laughable story line . Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to " Conquest " . Every film student should see this thing just so they 'll know the very definition of a bad movie .  
1	  Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in " Hot Millions , " a funny , quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden , Robert Morley , and Bob Newhart . Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer ( Morley ) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind . It 's not smooth sailing ; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company , played by Newhart , and his neighbor , Maggie Smith ( who knows him at their place of residence under another name ) , becomes his secretary for a brief period . She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired . When Newhart makes advances to her , she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up , but the two soon decide they 're made for each other . Of course , she doesn't know Ustinov is a crook . This is such a good movie - you can't help but love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov 's machinations , his genius , and the ways he slithers out of trouble . But there 's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains . Don't miss this movie , set in ' 60s London . It 's worth if it only to hear Maggie Smith whine , " I 've been sacked . "  
1	  While this movie won't go down in the annals of great cinema , it is a fun way to spend an hour and a half with the family . The film is finally being released in video where it should have debuted in the first place . The film is about an eclectic group of friends who gather for dinners which they have named , " The Hungry Bachelors Club " . Jorja Fox plays a woman who serves as a surrogate in order to get a down payment for the restaurant that she wants to open . Bill Nunn plays a Cadillac-loving mystery man who becomes her lover . Fox gives an understated and touching performance and Nunn is reliably talented as always . Micheal des Barres is a hoot as an over the top attorney . The ensemble casts - made up of familiar faces - works nicely together to bring this wacky group of characters to life . This is a good rental and one of the few you can watch with the whole family .  
1	  This is a story about Shin-ae , who moves to Milyang from Seoul with her young son Jun to start over after the accidental death of her husband . Her husband was born here , and she is opening up a piano school , but also has ambitions to own some land with the insurance money she received from the death . If that is what the film was about , it probably would have been like a Hollywood film , with her falling for some local guy and being happy with her son in their new home . But , this is not Hollywood . Her son gets kidnapped and murdered , ostensibly because it is known she has cash from the settlement . The grief process , attempts at moving on , attempts to clear her conscience of guilt , are all done admirably , and the lead actress is superb . The only caveat , and it has to be stated , is that this is a depressing film . You have to know that going in . You want Shin-ae to go through her grief and find some measure of happiness . Again , this is not Hollywood , it is Korea and in Korean cinema , especially drama , they pull no punches . Life is what happens to you . Great acting , but sometimes a tough film to watch , due to the goings on . If you stay , you 'll be rewarded . Do that .  
0	  I had heard some bad things about Cabin Fever almost as much as I heard the cultish hype . As it turns out , the first film from the new impresario Eli Roth , it 's just a so-so effort with the IQ points dropping as the film progresses . There are worse movies out there , and surely more gory ones ( while I 'm not sure how the hype-meter got so high on the blood-count for Hostel , there is a good amount for genre fans here ) . The premise isn't necessarily bad either though : kids go to a cabin for a week of partying , only to come across a very sick man , covered in blood , whom in a panic they set on fire . He winds up dead in the water that feeds the reservoir , and soon the characters all succumb to the flesh-eating virus one way or another . The characters , either the lead college kids ( including Rider Strong as the hero and James DiBello as the goofy side-bar ) or the supporting ' village ' folks are archetypal to the point of inertia , if not painfully so . As they meet their fates , the townspeople get pretty weird , and it just seems to be non-sensibly thrown together without the many laughs ; ' Pancakes kid ' comes out of nowhere , and maybe might have been funnier in another movie or by itself , but in the context of the rest of the movie , it just doesn't work . There 's also a young police character who is even dumber and less convincing than the others . And the family that goes after DiBello following an incident has some possibilities that aren't realized . But all the while , Roth pumps up his script with common sense out the window and sudden scares and frights with people hacking up blood on one another and a killer dog rambling around . Which isn't all for not either . Now , unlike lesser Troma horror movies or even lesser ones of the 70s or 80s - to which I 'm sure Roth is a die-hard fan - he doesn't make it unwatchable . It 's also smart to not have any explanation for where the virus comes from . But unlike those films too , he also doesn't really have a fine idea of what makes for great campy-horror times . His film tries for that , of course , and only once or twice does he make it a goofy , bloody time ( I did like the random bunny Strong sees while on the gurney ) . It 's not even very poorly shot a lot of the time ( albeit with its own contrived style-choices ala red tint on the lens or that story with the bowling-alley worker ) . It simply contains a lot of illogical scenarios and choices made ( shave your legs with a deadly virus , uh-huh ) , and it aims for fairly typical ground . If that 's your cup of tea , more power to you . But at the end I found it to be actually un-exceptional genre territory that doesn't offend audience sensibilities ala Saw , but doesn't swing for the fence either as a clever B-movie . Roth also has the temerity to end the movie on a true note of ' what-the-hell ' as the Santa Claus bearded convenience store clerk from earlier in the film serves a bunch of black people . It could work if he followed up on it with something better , or if he dropped it altogether . Same could be said for a lot of the movie . C-  
0	  I saw Chan Is Missing when it first came out , about four years after moving from San Francisco to New York . Maybe it was the perspective of a few years away , but this movie seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything else I 'd ever seen ( still does ) . It concentrates on one particular community - the Chinese - but that 's fine , because so much of the city 's soul is refracted through the settings , the faces , and the maybe above all the voices of the characters . This isn't the tourists ' San Francisco . The settings are humble and everyday : a taxi cab , the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant , Richmond District row houses , little Chinatown apartments and small-business offices , the piers , a Philippine elder center . This is what the city looks and feels like day to day to the people who live there - even now , in the era of Silicon Gulch urban redevelopment . Unlike , say , Dirty Harry ( in its own way an excellent San Francisco movie as well ) , everything is filmed at street level : We come to understand the characters ' points of view from the perspective their surroundings give them , not from some fancy vertiginous shooting . Wang apparently filmed in B & W because he didn't have the money to do otherwise , yet one of the strongest visual elements of the movie is the natural light he achieves . The often harsh , pervasive quality of the sunlight is one of my closest associations with San Francisco : It seems to expose everything , bringing the buildings , the hills , the other landmarks down in scale and , in a funny way , making the people you pass on the streets seem more individual and potentially closer to you than they might in another place . Wang 's photography perfectly conveys this , and even helps the story along at points . Wang captures the speech and conversational style of Chinese and other San Franciscans better than anyone ever has , I think . If there 's such thing as a true San Francisco " accent , " it 's what you hear from the balding taxi medallion broker ( I think ) who appears talking on the phone in one scene ( listen to the way he calls the person on the other end " ya dingaling ! " ) . The story is poignant and , despite a few very small missteps , makes its points beautifully about the longings that pull at the hearts of people living in old immigrant communities - including the justified political and ethnic resentments , and little ironic amusements , that help to fuel them . All this is communicated delicately - perhaps why some respondents here think the film meanders . It doesn't - suffice it to say that the two cab drivers ' quest for Chan becomes a quest for something more personal . Chan Is Missing finishes up with a Chinatown travelogue sequence backed by a goofy novelty song from the 1930s ( I guess ) about San Francisco and all its crazy diversity . An American caricature , yes , but somehow not entirely off the mark either .  
0	  The movie had a good concept , but the execution just didn't live up to it . What is this concept ? Well , story-wise , it 's " Dirty Harry " meets " M " . A child killer has begun terrorizing a city . The lead detectives ( Dennis Hopper and Frederic Forest ) have never dealt with a serial killer before . The Mayor and the Police Chief , in desperation , secretly hire the local mob to speed things up .. to go places and do things that the police wouldn't be able to in order to bring an end to this mess as soon as possible . To be fair , this film DOES genuinely have some good things to offer . Besides the concept , I liked the look of the killer 's hideout . Norman Bates has his basement . This guy has an eerie sewer . In some of the shots , the light bounces off the water and creates rippling reflections on the walls ; often giving these scenes a creepy , dreamlike quality . The acting was good too . Dennis Hopper is one of those actors who gets better with age . Once you get past that , however , it more-or-less goes downhill . The film is paced way too fast . The actual investigation process from both teams feels very rushed as opposed to feeling intricate and fascinating . This could have been fixed in two ways : either make the film longer or cut out some of the many subplots . Either of these would have allowed the crew to devote more time to the actual mystery . For an example of how bad this is , one of the crucial clues that helps them zero in on just the right suspect is this : at one point in his life , the suspect went to a pet shop .. That 's right .. I 'm being totally serious here . It 's like they went from point A ( the first clue ) to point Z ( the suspect ) and skipped over all the " in-between " steps . Then there 's the characters . The only ones I actually liked were two pick-pockets you meet about half-way through the movie . Considering that they 're minor characters , I 'd call that a bad sign . Finally , there 's the mob angle . This is the one that gets me the most because THIS is why I coughed up the $ 3 to buy the DVD in the first place . I mean , what a hook ! There 's been an absolute glut of serial killer flicks in the last 10-15 years . The mob angle was a gimmick that COULD have helped it rise above the rest .. , but it didn't . I figured the gangsters 's methods would be brutal , but fun and thrilling at the same time ; kind of like a vigilante movie or something .. maybe they 'd even throw in some heist movie elements too . We ARE talking about criminals , after all . Instead , we 're given some of the most repulsive protagonists committed to celluloid . The detectives question witnesses . What does the mob do ? They interrogate and kill them . It 's not even like these witnesses are really even that bad either . I actually found the criminals less likable than the killer they 're hunting . Unless the good points I mentioned are enough to get your interest , I 'd say give this one a miss . Maybe some day , they 'll reuse the same story idea and do it RIGHT . I hope so . I hate to see such a good concept go to waste .  
1	  Super-slick entertainment with a stellar cast , an outstanding script , and a firm grip on the approaching 1950 's . At the time , RKO was turning out classic noirs by the dozens . But whatever the value of those shadowy downers , they reflected a war-time mood soon to give way the sunnier climes of the Eisenhower era . Few films of the late-40 's are further from that noir cycle or more attuned to the coming consumer decade than this sassy little comedy . Jim Blandings ( Cary Grant ) works as an ad-man on Madison Ave . where in his little daughter 's words - he sells things to people that they don't need , at prices they can't afford . He 's making good money , but like thousands of others , he 's tired of living in a cramped urban " cave " . So , with wife Myrnah Loy , they strike out after their dream house in the wilds of the Connecticutt countryside . Needless to say , in the arms of nature , they get more than they bargained for and in hilarious fashion . There 's hardly a lifeless line in the entire script . I don't know if writers Panama and Frank got an Oscar , but they should have . Of course , the humor revolves around all the problems that pop-up when city people build a big house on rural land . The annoyances pile up almost as fast as the mortgage , with all the eccentric types running the construction show and giving Grant a hard time . Of course , no one carries off annoyance or frustration more humorously than Grant , so it 's just one well-placed laugh after another , particularly when the locked closet appears to have an infernal mind of its own . Yet , oddly , the film appears to have no comedic high-point . Instead the laughs are spaced out so expertly that they don't peak at any particular point . That 's a real movie triumph for any era . Reaching back 60 years later , we can see how deftly the script ideas look ahead rather than behind . With their live-in maid , the Blandings may not be a typical American family , but that post-war migration from cramped cities to spacious suburbia was typical . And what more suggestive job for the coming consumerism than Blandings as an " ad-man " tasked with finding catchier ways to sell more " ham " . More than anything , however , there 's the movie 's sunny optimism . Oh sure , the feeling falters at times , yet the belief that a better future is on the horizon if the Blandings just stick to their dream carries them through . Indeed , life was going to improve for a lot of people during the coming surge , so I expect the film resonated deeply with audiences of the day . It 's that easily over-looked subtext , along with the sheer entertainment value , that makes this movie a key comedy statement of the post-war period . So , if you haven't seen it , catch it next time around .  
1	  If you 've seen this movie , you 've been to Puerto Rico . I 've lived in Puerto Rico all my life , and have to shamefully admit that we ( PR ) are living a real chaos right now , drugs being the main reason for the shootings and killings we have almost every day . These people will shoot anyone , anytime and anywhere , and many innocent lives have been lost because of this . We don't feel safe anymore , and in addition to this , our so-called " justice " is no longer moved by truth and rightness , but by money , influence and power . " Ladrones y Mentirosos " is based on real , deplorable facts , and truly portrays Puerto Rico 's three main problems : the drug-related killings , money and power manipulating our courtrooms , and innocent people and children being corrupted and even dying because of this . Ricardo and his wife Poli , with their true-to-life plot and their award winning direction ( *) , were brave enough to present all this as bad as it is : Puerto Rico is a beautiful and friendly country , living a nightmare that doesn't seem to end ! * They recently won the " Copper Wing Award " for Best Director in the World Cinema Competition at the 2006 Phoenix Film Festival .  
1	  Very nicely done movie . It does stay in your memory . Better billed as a romance than flying or war , altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free . Flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes , unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love . Fun watching early Crowe . He is good and exudes charm . His reading of " High Flight " is superb . cheers , Boom  
0	  My family and I screened Underdog the night before . And as bad as Underdog is ( my four year old loved it ) , Hot Rod makes it look like Oscar worthy material . The only thing that could have saved this movie , was if Evel himself had come out of retirement to slap Samberg in the face for making this movie . I will admit however , that the soundtrack was good . I wasn't sure if the movie was set in the 80 's , but with the majority of the music coming from Europe ? Who knows . If I were you , I would take a pass . And just stay at home and watch the test pattern on your local TV station . Or if you are dead set on watching this , people under the influence might enjoy it .  
1	  I for one was glad to see Jim Carrey in a film where being over the top wasn't the goal . His character is like all of us . Wanting more - better things to happen to us and expecting God to deliver . Morgan Freeman made a great God . With a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself . I thought Jennifer Aniston 's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards Carry 's basically self-centered TV anchorman wanna-be but that 's the way it was written . I think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened . I have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep . This is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart . A funny film .  
1	  from the view of a NASCAR Maniac like I am , the movie is interesting . You can see many race cars from 1983 . Even tough , the racing scenes are not that much realistic . But I have to admit , that I haven't seen any race before 1995 , because before that time , they didn't show any NASCAR races in Germany ) from the view of a Burt Reynolds fan like I am , the movie basically is what we are used to see from Reynolds in the 80 's : Burt behind the wheel of a fast car , like in his Bandit Movies . If you love NASCAR and Burt Reynolds , this movie is a must-see . If you only love one of this 2 things , I also recommend to watch it . If you like neither NASCAR nor Burt Reynolds , you still should give it a chance , but remember , this movie was far away from winning an Oscar Academy Award . It is the typical humor of the 80 's . If you like movies like the Cannonball Movies , and Police Academy , you will also like that one .  
1	  There 's no way to confront ' Zabriskie Point ' from a rational standpoint or attempt to describe it using words and conventions you 'd use for other movies . This is because it isn't a movie . It 's an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have that somehow got turned into an object as mundane as a film . What we see are not the unfoldings of a plot , but rather a sequence of events that we don't see in films every day but only imagine happening as the background we ourselves will supply when we hear about some tragic event in the news of or from friends . We we see is our imagination of people that are abstractions to us - no one we know , but we 've doubtless heard of them in a book or on TV or somewhere . So what do we see ? Events . We see people arguing , driving , and inevitably , escaping . Only the escape is from something intangible - it is the collective situation and cruelty that the mass of a civilization has allowed to exist though laziness , or .. human nature . Set in late 1960s Los Angeles , our players act against and in response to the self-inflicted miseries of modern existence . These creatures are effectively blank slates that can display any trait we can imagine if we desire . Although the actions taken might be seen as criminal or irresponsible , , the characters are not themselves criminals . They are human beings seeking a return to a familiar , non-manufactured existence that is beyond the normalcy they experience everyday . Not that they are ever happy or sad , but they achieve a type of self actualization when they move beyond and away from the suicide of modern living . They only achieve true life in the natural world , even though that is the next victim of modern existence . At the end , ' Zabriski Point ' is a eulogy of humanities attachment to the natural world . As even the most desolate pieces of the earth succumb to our notions of progress , we lose our souls on the path to death of the human spirit .  
0	  This is by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen , the poor special effects along with the poor acting are just a few of the things wrong with this film . I am fan of the first two major leagues but this one is lame !  
0	  Why do I watch movies like this ? - other than I have some weird misguided masochistic belief that one day I will find a true gem amongst all this dross I can't think one one good reason . This movie was dross from start to finish - but semi-hilarious dross . Where else but in a bad Italian dubbed movie could you find heated exchanges of surreal mangled English like this one between a honest military type and the sinister chief of a secret X-files like organisation dedicated to hiding " The Truth " : Man in Black : Silence is best for us until we are able to prove that the UFOs have no bellicose motives . Military Type : In any event I find your interference abusive . Man in Black : Whoever has to impose his will is . I rewound the DVD ( you know what I mean ) a good half dozen times and I still can't make those lines mean anything sensible . My other fave line was : " We can be quite hard on those who contravert our interests . " It 's English Jim , but not as we know it . The other highlights of this dull plonker of a movie for me were the totally spaced out acting of the photographer character at the start . Saddled with the worst haircut EVER in the history of everything , the man just wandered around looking like a stunned fish in a bad wig till kidnapped and forced to look at a piece of Plexiglas by some aliens . The aliens are most effectively not seen as a POV shot - hand held camera with a fish-eye lens - sort of spooky the first time but , used over and over again it lost its power ( incidentaly , if it is a Point of View shot , it means the aliens always walk out of rooms backwards for some reason ) . The film was set in " England " . This meant the Spanish Italian set designers put some British number plates on a couple of English cars and put a Union Jack on our hero 's press card .. and that was about it . No other attempt to make it look like the UK at all . Favourite moment ? When the Foley artists didn't notice that characters they were foleying ( is there such a word ? ) were no longer walking on gravel but were now on the lawn so their feet kept on making loud " crunch ! crunch ! " noises . Other than that , another total waste of 90 minutes of my life . I hope they prove those UFOs have no bellicose motives soon ..  
0	  There 's no denying the first Azumi film was a commercial product ; it was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast of young , attractive actors and certainly wasn't lacking in the budget department . Yet it more than entertained for what it was , and I can't deny I enjoyed it immensely . " Azumi 2 " lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful . The first thing that should set alarm bells ringing is the absence of the superb Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm . With him , he seemed to take not only his own visual flair and kinetics , but the originals style , beauty and most importantly , its heart . While the first had a simple " hitlist " plot , this one has a corkscrew mess of a story , with too many dull characters stabbing each other in the back so many times the potential for any sympathy or pathos is obliterated . Gone is the effective interplay between the lead characters ; Azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a bunch of stroppy teenagers arguing in a forest . Characterisation is non existent ; if anyone watching actually cares who lives and who dies , I 'll be shocked . The same applies to the villains here . The final battle - in fact all the battles - are completely devoid of any sort of tension . The fact that they are poorly choreographed and abysmally directed - not to mention few and far between - is made a sideline by their own sheer pointlessness . The villains themselves try far too hard to be campy , and even if they were all combined , they don't come within a country mile of the Pete Burnsian antics of Jo Odagiri in the original . # Major Spoiler at end of paragraph ! # Aya Ueto tries her best it has to be said , and she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between the films . Azumi is now a fully fledged assassin , meaning she can wave her sword around in slow motion ; unfortunately , now the character is instilled with a sort of Man With No Name style mysteriousness , Ueto 's model looks become even more inappropriate . I know this is supposed to be the point , but this combined with the ineffectiveness of everyone else in the film , the stupidity of the plot and the general ineptness of the film in general means it is downright impossible to get behind her character this time around . The less said about Chiaki " Remember me from Kill Bill " Kuriyama 's performance the better ; it suffices to say her " turn " from good to evil is about as subtle as napalm . Overall , this was just a colossal disappointment . Any merits is does have were done ten times better in the first film . A lazy , unsatisfying - and generally downright boring - mess .  
1	  Like the characters in this show , I too was a teen during the 70s . The producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist , of being a suburban teenager in the 70s . The 70s fashions , cars , home furnishings , foods , and fads , are all very authentic in this show . The show boasts a very talented ensemble cast , who all mesh together very well on camera . I really like the unique , psychedelic-style film sequences . No other show does camera tricks like this . These cutting-edge film sequences , really help to convey the campy hipness , that characterized the 70s era . Overall this is a very funny sitcom . The one thing that bothers me about this show , is it 's over-reliance on cruel humor , to generate laughs . In this way , I think that this show tries to be too much like Married With Children . While Married with Children is a great sitcom in its own right , it 's tacky that the creators of That 70s show , keep trying to imitate it . I do recommend That 70s Show , mainly due to it 's nostalgia factor . It could be an even better show though , if the writers relied more on witty dialog , rather than bawdy , tasteless jokes and pranks .  
1	  What a fun filled , sexy movie ! They certainly don't make them like this anymore . 4 sexy au pairs arrive in London and have all sorts of sexual misadventures . The tone is oddly innocent , as the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situations , rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters . It is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant . Richard O ' Sullivan literally gets ' Randi ' ( sic ) . The film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties and naturism films of the old school . My special interest in ' Au Pair Girls ' is that I am a huge fan of Gabrielle Drake . If any actress has ever looked better naked ( she 's slim but wonderfully curvy ) , or clothed , come to that ( I 've loved her since the original run of UFO - who else could carry off a purple wig ! ) , I 'll eat my hat .  
0	  How a director of Altman 's experience could ever expect us to want to spend time with , or to care about what happens to , a lead character who is neurotic , a whiner , a jerk with no redeeming qualities - that is the central puzzle about this profoundly confused piece of work . A monstrous piece of trash . In addition to this crippling flaw , the plot line requires serious concentration to follow . The setup that the Branagh character walks into is so obviously a setup from the start that we are inclined to wonder whether the writer and director have totally lost respect for their audience . This latter issue is at the core of the film : it represents directorial self-indulgence with profound contempt for the taste , values , and intelligence of the viewer . Very unusual for Mr. Altman . Patrick Watson  
1	  Not only do the storylines in " The Sopranos " engage audiences from all over , but I think ( for me at least ) what brings the viewers back is the acting . ( Not even you , Gary , can dispute that claim ) James Gandolfini , who plays the lead-man , Tony Soprano , has become ( in this viewer 's opinion ) one of the " Hollywood Elites " as far as acting in a television series goes . I wouldn't go ahead and compare him with Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino , or at least , not just yet . He , however , does do a hell of a job playing the part of Tony Soprano . In the years since 1999 , Gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor ( mainly thanks to his role in The Sopranos ) that today he is considered to be among the best in the business . And it 's not just him . " The Sopranos " fields a great supporting cast including that of Lorraine Bracco , Edie Falco , Michael Imperioli , Dominic Chianese , and the late Nancy Marchand who played Tony 's dreadful mother . At this point in the show 's existence , it 's being considered a cult-classic and rightfully so . The first two seasons were extraordinary . Violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner , but without a doubt , extraordinarily done . The third season was great , but didn't quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2 . Season 4 , which wrapped up right before new-years , was the weakest season yet ( or at least , in my opinion it was ) . Despite a dry-spell , I still found it ( season 4 of " The Sopranos " ) to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that 's saying a lot because lately I 've been noticing a trend in good new television shows . Examples of this : Six Feet Under , The Shield , Curb Your Enthusiasm , and OZ ( which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year ) . To get back to my point though , to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year , no less , is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers . " The Sopranos " ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit . To close , I 'd like to say , " The Sopranos " is the real deal folks . For the average mature viewer ( 17 and above ) who enjoys drama and doesn't mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity , you might want to check out " The Sopranos " if you get the chance . Trust me in that it will be well worth the time .  
0	  I read the comment of Chris_m_grant from United States . He wrote : " A Fantastic documentary of 1924 . This early 20th century geography of today 's Iraq was powerful . " I would like to thank Chris and people who are interested in Bakhtiari Nomads of Iran , the Zagros mountains and landscapes and have watched the movie Grass , A Nation 's battle for life . These traditions you saw in the movie have endured for centuries and will go on as long as life endures . I am from this region of Iran myself . I am a Bakhtiari . Chris , I am sorry to bother you but Bakhtiari region of Zardkuh is in Iran not in Irak as you mentioned in your comment . Iran and Irak are two different and distinct countries . Taking an Iranian for an Irankian is almost like taking an American for an Mexican . Thanks , Ziba  
0	  This was the worst movie I saw at WorldFest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards ! I can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film . It 's great to see J.Beals but she 's only in the movie for a few minutes . M.Parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for . The rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable . The main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch . There is no real emotional depth to the story . A movie revolving about an actor who can't get work doesn't feel very original to me . Nor does the development of the cop . It feels like one of many straight-to-video movies I saw back in the 90s .. And not even a good one in those standards .  
0	  What a disappointment ! This film seemed to be trying to copy ' cutting edge ' comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy , sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition . Jack Black 's acting / role was self-indulgent and self-regarding .. and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting . The soundtrack was tedious . We are ( WERE ) fans of Black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration . Why did he feel he needed to make this mistake ? We will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first ! Was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel ?  
0	  I dont know about you , but I 've always felt drawn to ' ART ' cinema . The first ' art ' film I managed to get a hold of was Peter Greenaway 's " The Cook , The Thief , His Wife and Her Lover " , which blew my mind and creative spiret into overdrive . The film was the ultimate paradox , both beautiful and grotesque .. this is what ' art cinema ' was about , exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with purpose . Life , real life , can be like living in a madhouse , and art expressed shows it for what it is . I love movies of all types , but especially those that both entertain and have something to say , whether I agree with it 's stance or no .. " 8 1/2 WOMEN " , is a dry , clinical ' comedy ' where a father and son gather a harem to fufill their many sexual fantasies . There is only a very brief allusion to Fellini in the film , unlike what the previews have suggested . The main focus of the film falls on the ' close ' relationship between father and son , brought together after the mothers ' death . In the early scenes of the film the fathers ' sadness is believable , you can feel his pain . What happens afterwards is plain by Greenaway standards , the gathering of the harem , observations on love and death , and flesh displayed for the sake of flesh .. One could argue this , but I feel the movie to be shallow and pointless . And the idea that this could be a comedy is perplexing to me . The acting for the most part if fine , .. especially good are Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer ( though poor Mandy should put her clothes back on ) What the film lacks is a compelling story , and the usual Greenaway touches of excess that made his other films so wonderful to watch . While filled with moments of insight , and the occasional taboo , " 8 1/2 Women " is too cut and paste to be considered art , too bland to considered ' funny ' , and simply too dull to be considered worthwhile . Save your money .. I can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid . 4 out of 10  
1	  Jim McKay has made one of the best films you will see all year . The quiet simplicity of this film draws you in from the opening shot and never lets go . There is not one false note in the entire film . Not one . Everything works . The hand-held camera is never distracting and always where it should be . The three young ladies whose lives we follow are always real . There isn't a single beat where the audience is reminded we are looking at actresses performing a role . These are just real girls trying to find themselves . There is no political agenda , hidden or otherwise . This is cinema at its most basic , and although it will probably only be seen by a handful of movie-goers , it deserves a much wider release . A special hats off to Hugh Hefner for providing the film-makers with the grant money needed to get this important film made . I can't wait to see what Mr. McKay does next .  
1	  I swear when I first saw this movie , I cried my eyes out ! A STAR IS BORN is the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles John Norman ( Kris Kristofferson ) and Esther ( Streisand ) face . You also experience what it 's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie . Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry together and the music is fantastic ! When Streisand sings With one more look at you / Watch closely now , it 's just pure magic ! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my favorites , and Queen Bee is such a fun song . Also I love the fashion of the ' 70s ( except Streisand 's afro . Besides that , she 's a beauty . ) . A Star is Born is my number one favorite movie . This movie is a pleasure to watch and is a heart-breaker at the end .  
0	  Watching this stinker constitutes cruel and unusal punishment at the hands of Sandler . Truly a slow and painful death . ' Bought the DVD in the $ 5.88 bin at Wal Mart . But the thought that keeps echoing in my head is , " How can I get my money back ? " The most unforgivable thing about the movie is that the boat JUST DOES NOT SINK ! Best constructive suggestion : Mystery Comedy Theatre . You know that show on the SciFi Channel in which some guy and his muppet-machines spoof the most unwatchable horror flicks ( Mystery Science Theatre ) . IMMEDIATELY , spin off a comedy program and feature this flick . Without a good humorous spoof of this train wreck , I fear that viewers may actually begin following Sandler with ice picks and chainsaws .  
0	  I came here for a review last night before deciding which TV movie to settle in front of , and those I found made this one look unmissable . How misled I feel ! Firstly , it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewife 's daytime movie . The performances are wooden , every sentence is an attempt at ' poignant ' in the way that housewife 's daytime movies and bad soap operas always are , and it is based in that predictable and well-trodden premise that men ( particularly soldiers ) are essentially violent and incompassionate . The whole movie is about the ' drama ' apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension . If that sounds tolerable ( or even enjoyable ) to you , then be warned . Linda Hamilton 's German accent , while quite good , is painfully distracting - as is her face , for some reason . The other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators , with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day . There are few surprises , but do watch for the ' Monty Pythonesque ' endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers ' knapsacks ! I wasn't expecting action , but I had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged . What I got was a particularly bad Christmas ' feelgood ' story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all . Watch it under the folowing circumstances : 1 : There 's nothing else on . 2 : You are a fan of predictable ' housewife takes on men and wins ' TV movies . 3 : The only way you can appreciate a true story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film . 4 : You 've imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling .  
1	  Not sure one can call this an anti-war film , it shows war at an elite level . These are elite troops that know what they are doing and take great pride in it . Even when they are pacifist , they still enjoy the skill level and defeating their foes , even if it does go against being a pacifist . The movies is slow and rather uneventful and in many ways is rather tame as war movies go-more so by todays standards , no body parts flying off as in modern movies . It is brutal in other ways though as you see killing at a personal level . This is more of a thinking man 's movie . Once you start to watch you don't want to miss anything . The thoughts of the men in the movie and their interactions , is what the movie is about - not the combat itself or a big exciting storyline . This maybe called a war triller . If you are into the skill of war , if you are into reading or seeing programs about the SAS and so on , YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE ! Comparable movies are The Hill ( 1965 ) with Sean Connery , 49th Parallel ( 1941 ) with an all star cast , The Naked and the Dead ( 1958 ) with Cliff Robertson . All are unusual in their way and show war at a personal level . Enjoy !  
1	  Erroll works for The Department of Public Safety and his job is to check up on sex offenders . Sometimes he pushes the line at his job and beats on the sex offenders . I don't blame him but his boss is ready for him to retire so along comes Allison . Erroll is now training her to do his job and it 's like job shadowing . Allison is somewhat naive about the job in the beginning but she doesn't realize how much danger she really is and it 's all Erroll 's fault . He starts to go to far with his obsession of finding a missing girl when his job isn't to be a police officer . It 's a fairly decent movie about a crazy guy who pushes the boundaries and works outside his " scope of practice . " Erroll did do a good job but at the sake of the safety of Allison . It has some good mystery to it too and just when I had it figured out , there was more to it .  
0	  This movie isn't worth the film it was photographed on . The dialog is flat , filled with cliché overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time . The choppy , shaky , film style is a cheap imitation of the " The Ring " style visual effects . The characters do not even act like a normal person would . For example , the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door , creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesn't even once call out her sister 's name to see if she is home . What ? You would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her . Way too many flashbacks to her childhood . Too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director . It is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street , up the driveway , around this corner , over here , over there , oh a side view , now a front view . Enough already . You would think you are watching a TV commercial for the Solaris ! Terrible movie . 0 out of 100 . I really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it .  
0	  Having read some good reviews about this film I thought it was about time I go and see it . Well I don't know why I bothered . Basically this family is entrusted with a clue that leads to a whole big stash of ancient treasure , hidden by the Knights Templar during the War of Independence . Apparently it had to be kept out of the hands of the British at all costs . Firstly , why did said Knights move the treasure from Europe to America ? How did Nic Cages character figure out that ' Charlotte ' was in fact a ship ? How do they figure out all the clues and riddles in about a minute ? And how could two people suddenly become master thieves and steal what is probably the best guarded bit of paper in the world ? These are just some of the plot holes in this inane bit of Hollywood action gone wrong . Cage has been in some great action movies - ' Face-Off ' and ' The Rock ' - so why has he lowered himself to this ? Is he getting too old ? ! His character is pretty annoying really - Somehow this ' ordinary ' guy steals the Declaration of Independancd , outruns thieves with guns , escapes from the FBI and generally seems invincible . The whole film doesn't really make any sense and all in all it was quite a disappointment .  
1	  When I first found out that Brian Krause was going to be in this movie , I wanted to watch . It took me weeks to realize that I 've seen the original of this and loved it . So I had even more reason to watch . Well , I watched . It was actually better than most sequels for TV movies . I hate what happens to Brian 's character ( you can find out for yourself ) and I didn't like most of the characters , Brian 's one included . But the movie needed the cheesy and annoying and jerk-like characters to make Stanley Caldwell ( Judd Nelson ) shine once more . At the end , I was cheering for Stanley and his own happy ending . If you liked the original Cabin by the Lake or if you like horror movies without the blood , I 'd suggest you watch this .  
0	  The movie was awful . The theater was dead with silence ' cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash . I think someone gave Jet Li a lobotomy and made him perform a script with dialogue written by a five year old . The martial arts are ' ok ' , but when put next to the Jackie Chan movies and " The Matrix " you 're better off seeing one of those .  
1	  This is John Waters best film to date . The characters are obvious and symbolic , just as in his other films . So there are no surprises or character changes . I enjoyed the film because of the wittiness and pace of the story . It was good story-telling with honest people .  
0	  An anthology is always risky business and I think this endeavor should be praised . There 's a lot of talent involved here . A great many talented actors , directors and writers . Unfortunately , I couldn't really enjoy this movie based on three issues I had . First of all , the segments vary incredibly in tone and quality . And unfortunately some of them clash with the others . Secondly , several segments feel underdeveloped to me . Like seeds of good stories that never come to fruition . I 'm not talking about happy endings here ( or even an ending period ) but rather , they lack even basic development or even solid setups that draw you in . Last but not least , I did not feel New-York and its inhabitants were properly portrayed . What you 're left with is high-brow short films that may still be of interest to some but will leave the average viewer unsatisfied .  
1	  I recently watched the ' 54 version of this film with Judy , and while i appreciated the story and music , i found that the film failed to hold my attention . I expected the ' 76 remake to be the same story , except with a Barbra twist . I was pleasantly surprised - it was a much more realistic and modern look at fame , money , love and the price of it all . This version is so much more real than the ' 54 one , with arguably better music , better acting , a more gripping plot line , and , of course , a deeper love . I do not understand why the previous film is on the American Film Institute 's top 100 list , while this gripping remake fails to make a mark on any critic 's list .  
1	  My expectations were quite high for this film . Everyone I know who saw this film at the cinema told me that everyone there stayed through the credits because they were so touched . My expectations could not have been any higher , anything short of wonderful would have disappointed me . I was anything but disappointed by this movie . I loved how it dealt with difficult subjects without going through the usual steps a Hollywood film tends to include . In this film characters worked through problems they had had for decades , they worked through prejudicm , they learned to open up . But it did not come easily , and not just by singing a song or two . It was painful , it took arguments , it took confrontations . It felt like real life . One scene that really stuck out to me was the scene in which Gabriella sings her song . Helen Sjöholm is one of my favorite singers , her voice is lovely , and you could tell that she was not just lip-syncing to a previous recording during filming ( which I often find in other movies ) , she really sang with her whole body and soul . You could feel what Gabriella was feeling in that scene . Had this movie been made in Hollywood her song would most likely have been sung toward the end , and it would have made her husband open his eyes and see the error of his ways , as well as making the other people in the village realise a thing or two . Instead it came halfway through , and it did not bring any solutions . Her husband did not become overwhelmed and realise what he 's putting her through , and it didn't seem to make anyone else in the village more open minded . It was beautiful , it was pure and it was touching but it did not magically solve all her problems . That felt real to me , that 's probably what would have happened in real life . The whole movie felt like real life to me , nothing neatly wrapped up but everything with a sense of joy and happiness . You rarely find a movie which feels so realistic . There were a few things that bothered me , but hey , no movie is perfect . If you haven't already you should go see " As it is in Heaven " and be filled with a joy for life , a sense of hope and the feeling that you 've been touched on a level movies rarely reach . You will be sad , pained , happy and a dozen other emotions . Someone once said that if every person in the world sang in a choir there would be no more wars . Having seen this film I might have to agree .  
0	  The plot sounds vaguely interesting .. a scientist ( Bateman ) discovers how to transplant animal eyes and optic nerves into other animals , like humans . A young man ( Monteith ) is blinded saving a coworker at work - the scientist gets a call from a doctor that the young man is a good candidate to be the first human recipient . The recipient starts becoming more and wolf-like , but the effect is nothing more than " weird eyes " and running at night with dogs ! ( for the whole movie ) The budget is too low , the dialogue too stilted ( I laughed out loud at some of the ridiculous talk ) , and the acting too inept . Long portions of the movie are nothing more than dreamy looks , eerie music and interspersed clips of wolves in the wild . Way too long even at 90 minutes , boring , and devoid of ideas . The military want to use the eye transplants to give wounded soldiers back their eyesight , and presumably want to militarize the technology . There 's a silly subplot about a beautiful Indian girl ( Korey ) who thinks she can help , using Indian wisdom about the wolves . They make love while music heavy on drums and Indian chanting is heard - crazy , man ! The love making takes place immediately after a gruesome murder - who edited this turkey ? ! A grouchy " medicine man " who spouts platitudes seems to do little , except for adding atmosphere . Here 's two ridiculous scenes . A worker at the research lab goes into the animal room to discover the monkeys have been let out of their cages . She gets scared , looks left at the monkeys , turns right , turns left , turns right , turns left .. this goes on for a while ( who edited this ? ) . RUN OUT OF THE DAMN LAB ! It was so stupid I started laughing . Another ridiculous scene - our hero is at home , escapes out a window as the heavily armed military arrive - he leaves the window open , the military guys go to the open window , look out the window , they say " looks like he was here " , and LEAVE ! He went out the open window , guys ! Crazy . Near the end of the movie , military guys are firing machine guns over and over at trees , when obviously nothing is there - easier to place the squibs I guess . They have 6 machine guns which have cut down trees , but decide to fight our hero with 1 knife ! Shoot the guy ! Who wrote this trash ? There 's a pointless confrontation at the end , and believe me I 'm not spoiling anything for you - there 's not enough plot to spoil . I figure the whole thing was a tax write-off or a rush job to make use of unused budget money left over from some better movie .  
1	  One of the finest films ever made ! Why it only got a 7.6 rating is a mystery . This film is a window into the world of the black experience in America . Should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 . I recommend watching it with " The Long Walk Home " as a companion piece . If you think Whoopi Goldberg 's work is about " Homer and Eddie " or " Hollywood Squares , " think again . Don't miss this movie , which should have won the Oscar . ( And read the book , too ! )  
1	  For what it is , this is a pretty good movie . I like both Johns - Stamos ( " Full House " ) & Stockwell ( " Christine " , " Top Gun " ) . They both give strong performances . The love interest is OK , but this is more of a guy 's movie than a good date movie . I love Harleys , and I hated seeing them paint over the " 14 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer " with good old Army Olive Drab . There is a small history lesson here in that Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in WWII . I don't know if the training was quite like this bunches ! The movie kept my interest all the way through without getting slow anywhere , with good riding action sequences . I love looking at the demographics of the vote history - one 18 year-old man gave the movie a 10 ( true bike lover , I guess ) . I wouldn't give it a 10 , but I did give it an 8 . I do not weigh every movie with the same scale . There are movies that were big-budget , with great actors , that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big . ( Star Wars - Episode I is my best example ) I loved the first three SW movies , but I thought Episode I was weak in comparison . So it gets a lower rating from me than this movie . I expect more from George Lucas .  
0	  The only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the theme song . Stephanie Powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent . As has been pointed out , she is too old to play an 18 year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter ? Lee Remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years . The talented Joanna Lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son ( Robert Urich ) finally marries Grandma Stephanie Powers . Stacey Keach 's ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him . Don't know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal ? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson , who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs . It strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them . Can anybody believe that handsome Robert Urich would remain single for decades waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals ? The WW2 engagement between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is laughable . To begin with , the Germans did not occupy the Provence section of France until late in the war , it was controlled by the Vichy French puppet government . We see the French resistance staging a daylight raid on Mistral 's villa to steal sheets after which they all lounge under a bridge waiting for a lumbering truckload of Nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them ? If you want to see a well acted mini-series set in a foreign country , don't watch Mistral 's Daughter . A far better alternative would be The Thorn Birds .  
0	  This film takes what could have been a good idea , a mummified 2000 year old witch and completely destroys it . Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry-out . They go to stay with her Nan and Uncle . The uncle has discovered a 2000 year old witch preserved in the peat . He revives her and she takes the form of Nora . She cannot be killed conventionally , ( more is the pity ) . Nora , however , works out a way to do so . This is a Gothic horror movie that has been done on the cheap . It is a sprawling mess . I have to ask why anyone would want to make such a bad film . I am tempted to learn witchcraft in order to make it disappear . AVOID AT ALL COSTS  
1	  The idea 's which are shown in this film are with a lot of care and detail and depict what a lot of people from around the world think of the American Policies , not neccessarily the United States itself . It shows what most of the people around the world think about America and what the Americans dont know about themselves . 11 directors showing 11 amazing minutes each of something which will give US viewers a lot to think about when they go home after watching the movie .  
1	  In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review , this film actually was surprisingly good ! I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés , obvious jokes and overacting , all of which the trailer had promised . However , after 5 minutes in I found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting . With only one ' toilet humour ' gag , Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and , without spoiling anything too much , some of the moments involving animals are hilarious . The staple ingredients of a good film are all there ; script , director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy , this film stands tall . Sure , you aren't going to learn anything or have a spiritual awakening , but if you go with an open mind you will more than likely have a good time !  
1	  Shall We Dance is an excellent film because it shows how something , like dancing , can rejuvenate the life flow in the human spirit . Dance is seen as the expression of existence , and the birth of individuality . The is certainly the case with Aoki . At work he is a humble office denizen , but place him on the dance floor and all his bottled up intensity is released . Surprisingly , this release is frowned upon in Japan , due to the rigid culture of conformity . At the start of the film , all the characters are ashamed or frightened of their desire to dance . They will be scorned , or deemed perverted , for expressing their passion through dance . This film is well worth watching to witness the rebirth of human emotions and passions . It will leave a smile on your face for days .  
1	  I got to see this on the plane to NZ last week , and was wondering how it would measure up to both the UK film and the book . I have to say I was favorable impressed . If anything the fanatical attachment to the Red Sox during the lean years works even better than the original devotion to Arsenal FC , who have had success through the years . As a Brit I was also interested to see that you don't need to understand baseball to get what 's going on . One question springs to mind - Was the screenplay written using the Sox as the team even before they finally broke the Curse of the Bambino ? Or was another team in the frame ? As a Red Sox fan myself ( weird I know , a Brit who understands baseball ) I have to say that it added to the enjoyment .  
0	  ' Dead Letter Office ' is a low-budget film about a couple of employees of the Australian postal service , struggling to rebuild their damaged lives . Unfortunately , the acting is poor and the links between the characters ' past misfortunes and present mindsets are clumsily and over-schematically represented . What 's most disappointing of all , however , is the portrayal is life in the office of the film 's title : there 's no mechanisation whatsoever , and it 's quite impossible to ascertain what any of the staff really do for a living . Granted , part of the plot is that the office is threatened with closure , but this sort of office surely closed in the 1930s , if it ever truly existed . It 's a shame , as the film 's overall tone is poignant and wry , and there 's some promise in the scenario : but few of the details convince . Overall , it feels the work of someone who hasn't actually experienced much of real life ; a student film , with a concept and an outline , but sadly little else .

1	  There 's never a dull moment in this movie . Wonderful visuals , good actors , and a classical story of the fight of good and evil . Mostly very funny , sometimes even scary . A true classic , a movie everybody should see .  
1	  This has to be one of the best , if not the best film i have seen for a very , very long time . Had enough action to satisfy an fan , and yet the plot was very good . I really enjoyed the film , and had me hooked from start to finish . Added blood and gore in there , but brought the realistic nature of what happens to the front of the film , and even had a tear jerker ending for many people i should think . It is a must watch for anyone . Seen many reviews , slating the film , but to be fair , most the films that get bad reviews , turn out to be some of the best . this proves it once again . Rent this film , buy this film , just go out and watch this film . You will not be disappointed .  
1	  For the attention of Chuck Davis and Emefy : I saw PHANTOM LADY many years ago , when I was not yet a jazz buff . There is an exhibition going until end of June in Paris 's brand new MUSEE DU QUAI BRANLY , named LE SIECLE DU JAZZ , not to be missed , with as a special entertainment NINE excerpts from jazz movies , including PHANTOM LADY 's famous drums sequence . I 've seen Gene Krupa - and Elisha Cook Jr - in almost all their film appearances , and I can confirm the following : 1 . Elisha Cook Jr was DUBBED in the movie . That was some progress , since in most of his other appearances he was KILLED ( mainly in Howard Hawks 's THE BIG SLEEP ) . 2 . Krupa probably dubbed Cook in PL . I could recognize his style , since he had already graduated from the tom-tom used ( and abused ) at the beginning of his career - namely in 1937 's Hollywood HOTEL 's SING , SING , SING sequence - and eventually got everything that was possible from what we call in French " la caisse claire " . 3 . The sequence from PL , at least as shown in the Museum , is not censored . harry carasso , Paris , France  
0	  This is one of the most boring horror films I have ever seen , as it 's absolutely god awful , John Carradine has very limited screen time . All the characters are boring , and the story is terrible , plus I could see the two twists at the end coming miles away ! . The great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it wasn't so damn boring , and there isn't one character to root for either , plus I hope it makes it 's way to the bottom 100 , because it deserves to be there in my opinion . When John Carradine finally shows up at the end , it 's a pretty good scene but it 's already way too late , and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks , plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by Bee 's , as it was rather gory . I got this in a DVD Horror set called Back From The Grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion , plus it 's lucky this was included in a set I bought otherwise I would have chucked this out the window ! . This is one of the most boring Horror films I have ever seen , as It 's absolutely god awful , John Carradine has very limited screen time , and I say avoid it like the plague ! , you don't want to go through the torture . The Direction is absolutely terrible ! . Carl Monson does an absolutely terrible ! job here , making every thing look cheap , wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace . The Acting is just as bad . John Carradine is good in his scene , but other then that he 's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes . ( Carradine Ruled ! ) . Merry Anders overacts here terribly as Laura , as she didn't convince me at all . Ivy Bethune is OK , and somewhat creepy , but also overacted , she did have a creepy smile at the end though . Rest of the cast , I didn't pay enough attention too , as I had a lot of trouble getting through it , but they were all really bad . Overall please avoid this , It 's not worth the agony ! . BOMB out of 5  
0	  This is a movie about animal cruelty . Under the guise of a marathon race , we see depictions of extreme animal abuse , including literally running a horse to death IN SLOW MOTION . The guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burial / burning of the horse , which of course is still dead , having been tortured to death . This is one of the sickest , slimiest movies I 've ever had the displeasure of viewing . As Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their DYING animals , we 're supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race . I 'd like to put the producers and director in a marathon race ; I 'll decide when they 're finished , probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing .  
1	  I ran across this movie on the tv and could not turn it off . Peter Sellers plays an unlikable fellow who falls for an extremely warm and cute Goldie Hawn ( who wouldn't ? ) . The way that Goldie 's character holds herself from the beginning of the movie to the end is untraditional even today . This movie gave me a different angle into human relations and also I found it very funny . Peter Sellers role was a difficult sell , but I think he pulls it off well .  
1	  In my opinion , October Sky is one of the best movies of 1999 .. It totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need , like , wonderful story and good character interactions . October Sky will remain in heart for as long as I can remember , and I just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film .  
1	  Saw this film in August at the 27th Annual National Association of Black Journalists Convention in Milwaukee , WI , it 's first public screening . THE FILM IS GREAT ! Derek Luke is wonderful as Antwone Fisher . This young actor has a very bright future . The real Antwone Fisher did a great job writing the film and Denzel 's direction is right on the money . See it opening weekend . You won't be disappointed .  
0	  I 've had to change my view on the worst film in the world having just seen this one . THIS IS IT ! Make no mistake this film is awful . Here 's a list of reasons : Hopeless storyline ( despite being based on a true story ) . Dreadful acting ( what was Judge Reinhold thinking ) Unbelieveably bad stunts . Childish dialogue . Non-existent continuity . Lack of atmosphere . Get the picture ?  
0	  Fot the most part , this movie feels like a " made-for-TV " effort . The direction is ham-fisted , the acting ( with the exception of Fred Gwynne ) is overwrought and soapy . Denise Crosby , particularly , delivers her lines like she 's cold reading them off a cue card . Only one thing makes this film worth watching , and that is once Gage comes back from the " Semetary . " There is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone , and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason . It is absolutely bone-chilling . This film only does one thing right , but it knocks that one thing right out of the park . Worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so .  
0	  The peculiar charisma of Martin Kosleck brings a certain believability to his character of the frustrated artist . He imbues his dialog with an odd sense of realism , making the sculptor Marcel a convincing individual . The character manages to come across as a real person and not so much a typical B movie villain . The story line is nothing to write home about , and many scenes are dull . What makes it work is the strange chemistry between Kosleck and Rondo Hatton as the Creeper . Kosleck 's talkative , philosophical character is contrasted with Hatton 's low key , monosyllabic approach . The character of the Creeper isn't developed much beyond a basic monster level , but Hatton suggests undeveloped possibilities and makes you wonder about his back story . This movie was on Shock Theater a lot when I was a kid , so I have a certain nostalgic fondness for it . It 's worth seeing once , anyway , for those who enjoy Forties horror movies .  
0	  This documentary ( or I should say mockumentary ) is the perfect example of how ridiculous can the people be , when they have full enthusiasm on something like that . Honestly , I hate Cryptozoology . It is unscience , it just destroy it . However , something positive in this was the visual effects ( dragons were beautiful ) , but some of the information in this mockumentary was totally fake , and that is really disappointing because it was coming from scientists , so that is the reason why it deserves a 1 of 10 and not a 0 . An example of false information would be the hydrogen idea : It is true that , according to Chemystry , the hydrogen is produced in the stomach but it is impossible to be produced in that proportions , so in that case , you need a good explanation of what really happens in a dragon stomach . There are a lot of substances whit hydrogen in the nature but not the necessary to aloud an animal like that to fly , and the hydrogen does not appear from nothing , so it is impossible . Anyway , there is actually something worse , the idea of the platinum : This element is more difficult to find than gold , and I cannot explain myself how dragons survive depending of that . It is ridiculous , they present dragons like creatures with low chances of conquering the planet Earth , but off course at least that explain why they got extincted . Probably cryptologist 's call themselves scientists , but they are not . People like them say lies like in this mockumentary , and what is worst , some people buy them . But I do not think that a person who cares about Science would believe in dragons after watching this . Those fake scientists waste their time .  
1	  THE BLOB is a great horror movie , not merely because of the vividly horrific images of its nearly unstoppable , flesh-dissolving title character , but because it features a real societal message . It is , in many ways , a " feel-good horror film . " The clever storyline is helped immeasurably by solid performances from the entire cast . The two romantic leads , Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut , bring surprising depth and sentimentality to the proceedings . They are misunderstood but very well-meaning young people , and it 's very easy to root for them . This is a pro-society movie , and its juvenile delinquent characters cause trouble mainly out of boredom , not out of some malevolent character flaw . Steve McQueen 's drag-racing rival almost appears to be an enemy early on in the proceedings , but quickly joins in McQueen 's campaign to save the town from the oozing invader once he sees McQueen 's seriousness . In this way , a character situation that at first appears to be cartoonish suddenly develops depth and human realism . The authorities ' initial skepticism of the kids ' wild claims is proved wrong-and once the threat is acknowledged by all , all conflict within the society disappears . This unification of purpose , and the validation of the " troublemaking " teens , becomes official when Aneta Corsaut 's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the Blob . On any other day , breaking into the school would be considered an act of vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent-on this particular day , it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure . At this turning point , it is clear that there are no lines of division between the young and the old . This is an unusual film in that it acknowledges the perception of a " generation gap " but suggests that it is more imaginary than real , and that given a real crisis , people will naturally band together to restore order . " The Blob " is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that generally comes with a viewing of " Night of the Living Dead " ( 1968 ) . Much has been made of the film 's cheap but innovative ( and effective ! ) visual effects . They are undeniably clever . A lot of the gravity-defying tricks we see the Blob perform were achieved with miniature sets designed to be rotated . The camera was typically attached to the sets in a very firmly " locked down " position ( the lights had to be similarly attached so that the lighting remained steady as the room was turned this way and that ) . These scenes were often photographed one frame at a time as the room was slowly turned-the silicone blob oozed very slowly and its action needed to be sped up . In a way , this was similar to stop motion photography , but utilizing a blob of silicone rather than an articulated puppet . Even today , the effects are startling and bizarre . A very good film with an exploitative-sounding title , THE BLOB is a must-see .  
0	  Just utter trash . I 'm a huge fan of the Cusacks , this being the sole reason I watched this movie , but the only reason I can see for their presence was the reprise , in complete and depth less quality , their exact roles from Grosse Point Blanc . Apart from that , the films ' role as a political satire fails miserably as being too obvious for even the most moronic out there to serve any purpose . And to bill it as a satirical satire would be just plain insulting even to chimps . Imitation is , apparently the highest form of flattery , but seeing as though this is nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as meet the ( watch if your a moron ) Spartans in terms of political satire , lets leave well enough alone and let this one fade into the obscurity it absolutely deserves .  
1	  This is a tongue in cheek movie from the very outset with a voice-over that pokes fun at everything French and then produces a rather naif but very brave hero in Fanfan La Tulipe . Portrayed by the splendid Gerard Philippe , the dashing young man believes utterly in the fate curvaceous Lollobrigida foretells - notably that he will marry King Louis XV 's daughter ! Problem is , La Lollo soon find outs she too is in love with Fanfan .. Propelled by good sword fights , cavalcades , and other spirited action sequences the film moves at a brisk pace and with many comic moments . The direction is perhaps the weakest aspect but the film is so light and takes itself so un-seriously that I could not give those shortcomings a second thought . Look out for Noel Roquevert , a traditional heavy in French films , trying to steal La Lollo , making himself a nuisance , and feeding the script to the fortune teller that reads La Lollo 's hand ! And what a gem Marcel Herrand is as the megalomanous and lust-driven King Louis XV ! That is not all : So many beautiful women in one film makes me wish I were in France and on the set back in 1952 ! The film may have come out that year but its verve , cheek , superb narration , immaculate photography and the memorable Gerard Philippe ensure that it remains modern and a pleasure to watch . I would not hesitate to recommend it to my grandchildren let alone to anyone who loves movies in general and swashbucklers in particular ! Do see it !  
0	  This movie is an abomination , and its making should have been considered a capital crime . One of the great mysteries of film-making is why nobody ever has made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery . It is a tale of a really gripping mystery , nice old-fashioned romance , and dry English humor . Why did the makers have to change Richard Gordon from a Scotland Yard policeman to an amateur detective , introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his English servant , change the part of the main storyline about the murder charge and circumstances of Gordon 's struggle to save the accused , etc . , etc . ? These producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book should write the original script themselves and not to rape another person 's product .  
0	  When the young Kevin gets the boat of his dead uncle as a gift , he invites five friends of him to a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend . While in the journey , they drink booze , have sex and play games , with each one of them telling his or her greatest fear . Later Kevin drowns in the open sea , the engine stops , and they are haunted and murdered by their greatest innermost fear . Yesterday , my wife , son , daughter and three other friends joined to watch " Haunted Boat " on DVD . With less than 30 minutes running time , the group gave up watching this messy and boring amateurish piece of crap , and we decided to see another film . Later , I decided to watch the rest of this flick to see how bad it could be and it would have been better off going to bed to sleep . The confused story has an awful cinematography and camera work , with a cast that is probably studying to be actors and actresses and in the end this film seems to be a bad project of cinema school . The terrible and pretentious screenplay shows a ridiculous twist in the end , actually a complete mess that made me not understand what the story is all about . Was the girl insane and traveled alone in the boat , imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends ? If that is true , are their friend again in the very end fruit of her madness ? My vote is one . Title ( Brazil ) : " Viagem Para a Morte " ( " Trip to the Death " )  
1	  Fabulous costumes by Edith Head who painted them on Liz Taylor at her finest ! The SFX are very good for a movie of its age , and the stunt doubles actually looked like the actors , even down to body type , a rarity in movies of this vintage . A cozy movie , with splendid panoramas - even when chopped down to pan and scan .  
1	  I watch most movies that Nick Mancuso is in because , frankly , I love the guy , even though as he ages he is typically cast as the baddie ( long-time fans should note that he is for some reason blond in this flick ) . It 's a fairly familiar movie in terms of plot ( but then most movies these days aren't exactly original ) , but Rick Roberts is appealing as the imperfect husband , Martha MacIsaac is equally appealing as the daughter , and Mitzi Kapture does a good job , if that was her goal , of being angry and sometimes pretty hard to like . Nick has still got it in terms of being able to demonstrate both charm and psychosis . However , too much of the plot takes place off-screen - like motivation , prior behaviors , good times and bad times - and things that seem apparent to the characters never quite make it to the audience ( i.e. , me ) . The final scene leaves everything to be desired in the " but what about .. " category , and overall , I can't say that I cared much about any of the characters . That being said , it was what it was - a reasonably entertaining way to spend the afternoon - and I still like Nick .  
1	  This is far more than the charming story of middle-aged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing ( although it IS that as well ) . It 's the tale of one person learning to love life again , pushing past all the pressures of work and money to discover joy once more . The bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern Japan toward everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact . There are scenes that will make you laugh out loud .. a few where you 'll want to get up and tango .. and many others where you 'll just feel good . This is a great introduction to contemporary Japanese filmmaking for those who might be under the impression that all Japanese movies are " heavy " and inaccessible .  
0	  " Back of Beyond " takes place at a dive diner / gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor ( Paul Mercurio ) , a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive . We get what , at first , confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister ( though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film ) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle . Afterwards , he appears as a terribly quiet , and sometimes , moody character in the presence of the arrivals . We know one thing is for sure and that is McGregor 's sort of spiritual sense , his foresight of danger and such-his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story , the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who 's car breaks down and who rely on Tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way . Of course , Tom falls for one of the thieves , a young woman named Charlie , and suddenly , it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other . But not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action . In fact , the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant , but really fails to do so . Even the ending , of which plays out like a trite campfire tale ( and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws ) , is almost just as ridiculous . It may be worth trying if you don't mind the terribly slow pacing , but are in the mood , at least , for something a little different than the usual .  
0	  = minor spoilers = I am , like many others , a huge Jerry Bruckheimer fan . So when I saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front , and the trailer coming by before MI : 2 , expectations were rising . A Jerry Bruckheimer production . Big cars . Nic Cage and fresh from an Oscar - Angelina Jolie . What can possibly go wrong ? A lot . The script is neither funny ( which it tries really hard to be ) nor exciting . You put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and Wooh-haa ! you 've got comedy ? I don't think so . Excitement is totally out of the picture . First of all ( and this is probably said many times ) there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed ? IF you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill Nic 's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days , next thing you know is that Kip ( the brother ) is walking with Nic in the streets again . Is this excitement ? Think not . Then comes the best bit - the romance between Nic and Angelina . She actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to Nic . ' Do you have a girlfriend ? ' ' Are you seeing anybody ? ' ' What went wrong ? ' etc . Then there 's only one sparkle of hope left : the car chases . They 're disappointing to say the least , because the trailer made it look like it was full of them , and there 's only one . A very long one , caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement . I really had trouble following the action . So is it an action movie ? a thriller ? a romantic comedy ? - there 's no need to decide , just avoid this horrible mess . I 'll give 3 out of 10 stars , and I feel like I 'm being generous .  
1	  While Urban Cowboy did not ooze with the same testosterone you might find at a rodeo , it did provide an accurate glimpse of that day and age , in urban Texas . I also think that to truly critique this movie , one would have to have lived in the time and relative place that it was made . There was good music , fun times and , yes , a few " rough and tumbles " at the honky tonk roadhouses . The relationship of Bud and Sissy , like " two ships passing in the night " , was well conceived . When Pam tore up the note that Sissy had written to Bud , it echoed the tragedy of many true life romances . The entire story was well thought out . I thought the cast and crew did an excellent job . I thought the screen play was well written and directed . Scott Glenn should have received an Oscar for best supporting actor .  
0	  You 'd better choose Paul Verhoeven 's even if you have watched it .  
0	  There should be a rule that states quite clearly that movies like Resident Evil are supposed to be made in the spirit of the game , not in the spirit of blowing up everything possible . RE was a survival horror game , and a damn effective one at that , yet Paul WS Anderson managed to make it like any other video game movie to come along . Alone in the Dark is essentially the same kind of a spirit as Resident Evil , so of course , there is the slight hope the director will manage to have some piece of a brain enough to make a horror movie and not an action movie . Instead , Alone in the Dark just proves that there is no longer hope for video games becoming movies . The plot , despite the fact that it obviously isn't supposed to matter , is the largest of many problems with the movie . The movie starts with what can only be described as five minutes of scrolling text that may or may not be important , as after a minute passes , the audience stops caring and just sits through the rest hitting the object closest to them . Then there 's something about an orphanage , some artefacts , an ancient tribe , some bureaucracy and some demons , all of which get so jumbled together that the viewers really can't follow with what is going on . Characters move in and out of the plot like candy , some having huge build-ups for meaningless deaths . Basically , what I can understand is that some demons got released , and Edward Carnby ( Slater ) has some link to them thanks to some operation given to children in his orphanage which has failed on him . He finds an artefact involving the demons and brings it to an ex-girlfriend anthropologist ( Reid ) , who of course he manages to have sex with right away for no good reason . Then , out of nowhere , all hell breaks loose , and the pair end up with a military team led by some asshole commander ( Dorff ) , who apparently has a mutual hatred for Carnby . It 's all ridiculous , and the reason I don't really understand it isn't just because it 's complicated and jumbled , but it leaves no room for anyone to really care . Instead , I highly recommend that , if you must see this film , bring a tennis ball or something to occupy yourself when the plot manages to bore you into confusion . The action scenes in a movie with a plot as terrible as this should at least bring it up a little , right ? Too bad , this movie is like any other ruined crap ever made , with enough quick cuts to behead a coop of chickens . Considering that this is based on a horror game , not an action game , it is especially annoying . The first action scene involving a man chasing Cranby from a taxi is among the worst I have ever had to witness , and the rest isn't all that great either . The demons look somewhat cool , though the fact that they turn into powder when killed takes away all that effect . Scenes involving lots of guns which should be cool to watch instead involve the muzzle fire as the only source of light and the camera zooming and panning faster than the head of a crack addict . It 's all the kind of seizure inducing crap that keeps children in bed at night . The acting is what I like to call taking actors and making them do nothing . Slater does nothing but sound important for the whole movie , though he does seem to have more talent than he is letting on . The same is true of Dorff , who gets a thankless role despite actually having some talent ( something that has happened to him a lot ) . Reid is pretty much exactly what she should be , background sex appeal , as whenever she tries to act it is a disaster ( as is the incredibly bad scientist look she has in the beginning ) . In all , this is the type of movie that worries me about future video game movies . If they keep ruining the spirit like this , it 's only a matter of time before Samus Aran is killing Middle-Easterns with an AK-47 and Tommy Vercetti is fighting a squadron of aliens . Unlike Resident Evil , however , this one doesn't deserve a second chance , as I don't think anything could possibly help me forget just how terrible this movie is . It 's bland , uninteresting and unexciting . This is the movie equivalent of diarrhea ; it 's all thrown together , nothing really fits and , in the end , you 're just glad it 's over . TOTAL : 4 %  
0	  i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago . what a disaster . the acting was atrocious . there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon . this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didn't ring true . supposedly a modern reworking of the Hitchcock original " Lifeboat " . i think Hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it . from what i was able to suffer through , there is nothing compelling in this movie . it boasts a few semi big names , but they put no effort into their characters . but , you know , to be fair , it was nobody 's fault really . i mean , i 'm pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion . LOL . it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along . but for me , i 'm not willing to spend at least three days to find out . so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon , avoid this stinker / 1/10  
1	  A young man named Court is loved by everyone . His painful bloody death brings everyone closer . You can find other symbols and allusions throughout the movie . Whether predictable or not , and irrespective of ecclesiastical beliefs , this is a moving story , full of milieu and sensuality . One other thing , someone mentioned that his fate was so quick that it didn't seem plausible . But the elements for this are set up subtly . Note what his mom says about bringing his lunch out to the field . Note how he is holding the steering wheel and his gloves . He is sweaty and operating dangerous equipment . To this day , tractors are pretty dangerous .  
1	  Father of the pride is a pleasant surprise : It is funny , witty and features some great voice acting . The show is about the family of a Lion who is acting as the attraction of Siegfried & Roy shows . Indeed all of them are stereotypes but that 's what makes them so funny . FOTP is not a kiddie-cartoon it includes some crude adult humor but in a very mild way . It is full of popculture references and celebrity cameos and most of them are very well executed . I 'd say I 'll give the show a 7 out of ten because it is nice fairly well executed but not very original , I 've seen most of those stereotypes many times before , even in that particular order !  
1	  I saw this movie on the BIFF Festival in Brussel , spring 2004 . What a surprise ! This German production , a stylish and imaginative shocker , is one of the scariest flic i have seen . Be warned : this is not a joke ! This terrorizer has a big cast of good actors ( as an example : Peter Martell as a European guru has a strong presence ) , excellent direction , nice production design , a very good soundtrack and a lot of heavy gore sfx like Italian horror movies in the eighties . Flesh ripped clean to the bone .. and the blood runs red .. this savage Heart Stopper will grip you .. and give you some dark dreams .. A must-see !  
0	  STUDIO 666 ( aka THE POSSESSED in the UK ) is another sub-par slasher that has the appearance of a straight-to-DVD movie . Whilst many of the straight-to-DVD movies are fast-paced or unintentionally hilarious in the so bad it's good sense , STUDIO 666 is a lamentable failure . At the time of writing , every comment on the first page includes a negative rating and a negative review . Every one of these people have hit the nail on the head . The two people ( at the time of writing ) who wrote comments with a rating of 10 out of 10 should not be taken seriously . Obviously they 've seen few slasher movies and have an even more limited understanding of horror . The only really positive point I can make about this movie is that it does fare better than THE CHOKE and ONE OF THEM , two extremely mediocre slasher movies that I would not wish on my worst enemy ! The plot of this movie must have been done hundreds , if not thousands of times . The movie only has a slight twist ( and one that is badly handled ) to the usual expectations . A depressed singer commits suicide . Soon after , her spirit returns to possess one of her surviving friends . The said possessed friend goes on a killing spree . The rest of the plot really is too bizarre to sum up . You 'll just have to see it for yourself , providing your interest has not yet waned to the point of extinction of course . The acting in the movie is very poor for the most part . The actress who played Dora was an exception to this . Her character was always interesting and seductive when she was on the screen . She helps to elevate the movie above similar contemporary efforts . Unfortunately , some of the lines she was given to say were badly written to put it mildly and thus prevent her from saving the movie . The direction was equally poor . The villains did not seem the least bit menacing , every killing was totally devoid of suspense or tension , atmosphere was non-existent and the camera-work was incredibly basic . Some of the special effects ( if you can call them that ) reminded me of the TV series , GHOST STORIES . Unfortunately for the producers of this movie , GHOST STORIES had intelligently written scripts , believable performances and made superb use of camera angles . Maybe if the producers had watched that TV series closely , they 'd have picked up some more techniques that might have saved this excuse for a movie ! The music is completely unsuited to the tone of the movie . It 's just rock music and not the best examples of this type either . Don't get me started on that awful song played at the beginning ! Some aspects of the movie , particularly dialogue , are unintentionally funny . Unfortunately they are not funny enough to move the movie up ( or should it be down ) to the so bad it's good level . Overall , STUDIO 666 is a mundane mediocre slasher with very little noteworthy aspects . I recommend this only to those who are fans of straight-to-DVD movies and have a desire to see every single slasher ever made .  
1	  Marjorie ( a splendid and riveting performance by Farrah Fawcett ) narrowly avoids being assaulted in her car by vicious serial rapist Joe ( superbly played with frightening conviction and intensity by James Russo ) . However , Joe steals her wallet and finds out where Marjorie lives . He pays her a visit one fateful day . After subjecting Marjorie to plenty of degradation and psychological abuse , Marjorie manages to turn the tables on Joe and locks him in the fireplace . What is Marjorie going to do with Joe ? Director Robert M. Young and screenwriter William Mastrosimone concoct a harsh , gritty and often disturbing morality tale that astutely nails the stark brutality and painful debasement of rape while also showing how any person when pushed to extremes is capable of shocking acts of violence and inhumanity . Joe perceives women strictly as objects while Marjorie only sees Joe as an " animal . " However , this movie to its admirable credit refuses to make Joe out to be simply a vile one-dimensional creep ; instead he 's a terrifyingly real and ultimately pitiable human monster with a wife and kid ( Joe 's climactic confession in particular is genuinely poignant ) . Fawcett and Russo are both outstanding in the leads ; they receive fine support from Diana Scarwid as the passive Terry , Alfre Woodard as the sensible Patricia , and Sandy Martin as sympathetic policewoman Officer Sudow . Both Curtis Clark 's agile cinematography and J.A.C. Redford 's shivery , skin-crawling score greatly enhance the considerable claustrophobic tension . A real powerhouse .  
0	  Shecky , is a god damned legend , make no mistake . Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain , running their testing department . We would go through many new starters , they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores . Now to tortu ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ test the resolve of these new staff members , we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard . We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift , got round to sending their DVD player back , they never failed to send Shecky back also . Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with . Now , as to why this film is so bad , where do I begin ? Adam Sandler , who can be so , so very funny , as in Happy Gilmore , or the Wedding Singer , must have been having one hell of an off day . The rest of the crew stank , and what is it with Billy Zane ? His name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time , and he is a decent actor . Crazy . The production quality is absolute zero . I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could , because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it 's full name ' The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz ' on release . Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come , and just how low he can go .  
0	  We all know that countless duds have graced the 80s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust . Maybe that 's a bit hastey but damn if " Slaughter High " wasn't terribly unoriginal , even for a slasher flick . Pretty much , the plot involves a kid who experienced a Carrie-like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former-bullies who all show up to reminisce . As you 'd expect , they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on April 1st by means of electrocution , burning , hanging , and chemically altered beer . I 've got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie , but considering the ending , I feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time . Ignore any thought of viewing this movie ..  
1	  Scott Henderson , the engineer that employs Carol Richman , as his assistant , makes a point to call her " Kansas " , whenever he speaks to her . It shows us that Carol , effectively played by Ella Raines , is supposed to be a babe in the woods , as far as the Manhattan of the 40s was concerned . Only a woman , from out of town , would follow the shady bartender to a solitary elevated subway . Even then , only a naive girl could undertake such an adventure . Robert Siodmak directed this film noir very well . He shows a flair for infusing the story with a lot of raw sex that was surprising for those days . How else could we justify the way the drummer in the orchestra of the musical , where Scott takes the mysterious woman with an unusual hat , makes such an overt pass at a lady on a date ? The drummer played with high voltage by Elisha Cook Jr. doesn't hide his desires for any of the ladies who sat in the front row of the hit musical where he plays . It was a real explicit invitation , first to the " phantom woman " of the story , Fay Helm ; afterward , Cliff the drummer , insinuates himself very openly to Ella Raines who goes to the theater disguised as the mystery dame her boss had taken originally . This is a film that will hook any viewer from the beginning . There are things not explained in it , but it holds the one 's interest throughout . The killer is not revealed until the end . Ella Raines with her expressive eyes was an under estimated actress . She holds her own against much more experienced actors . Franchot Tone , a New York stage actor , working in Hollywood , never found in this medium the fame he deserved . He is effective as the accused man 's best friend . On the other hand , Alan Curtis , comes across as a man , who when framed , accepts his fate and is saved only by the tenacity of the woman who secretly loved him . Thomas Gomez , as the inspector Burgess , is an asset to the film as a detective who has his doubts the police had caught the man who committed the crime . This movie will not disappoint .  
0	  I didn't think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so abysmally on both fronts .. really awful . The fact that it doesn't take itself seriously ( usually a good thing ) works against it , primarily because the actors are so wooden you really would swear they are reading cue cards . On the upshot though .. the MST3K version , as always , has a few laughs ..  
0	  OK , so I rented this clown like Chainsaw Massacre esquire film , not expected much , but I did like the novel approach to a serial killer film . ( from the back of the box is the following synopsis ) " At first , it was just a joke - a myth around the campfire - for five friends staying at a remote cabin in the Texas woods . But when they began to disappear one-by-one , replaced by scattered , bloodied body parts and voodoo effigies , the remaining few scramble for their lives . But he 's out there . And he 's sick . And all he wants is blood .. " So obviously from the get-go it doesn't make sense : why is this clown in the woods to begin with ? Why a clown ? Why are their dolls with the word " food " drawn on them ? Why why why ? Hardly anything gets answered in this 1 hour 30 min . bore fest except where this clown lives . The characters are dumb guys , dumb girls , and a hell of a lot of bitchiness . One in particular is a girl whom they brought from a restaurant up the road , whom they thought they should help because she was getting hassled by some guy she knew . What warrants that as an excuse to bring a girl into your circle of friends or their cabin ? She , of course , begins planting seeds of jealousy , having the men have sex with her by feeding their dumb minds everything they want to hear . The music was an average affair ( standard frantic keyboard music like in every horror film without differences ) . The actors seemed to be brought from some soap opera the way they complained and whined about everything . The idea that the main guy in the film takes this girl to the cabin as their first date makes for a horrible date , but of course , she unrealistically gives herself to him on the first night of getting to know him . There was hardly a budget spent of anything , it seems , but there was a clown outfit and plenty of cheap $ 1-store dolls lying around in the woods , which was a horribly bland place to shoot this whole movie ( been done too many times ) . I was also waiting for the clown to jump into the house to kill the remaining 4 characters of the film ( in through the glass maybe ) , but nothing exciting like that ever entered the film . I guess you were just supposed to like the clown being a killer or something . I had to give the film a 3 . It was an interesting premise ( clown as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre character , essentially ) and I 'll give them a star for acting serious all the way through when the movie could 've totally been a B-movie-style video , but they opted for the more legitimate style of video . But ultimately , I probably would 've felt like renting the Killer Klowns from Mars video again before going back to check this out . Ah , but that cover art .. pretty awesome drawing .  
1	  After having read two or three negative reviews on the main page of IMDb for " Pushing Daisies " , and having literally minutes ago finished watching the final episode , I thought it was about time I said what I thought of PD . First off , to address what some of the issues that I have seen other people having with this show : something along the lines of " I expect the people who have been woken from the dead to have a more realistic reaction " . Realistic , on this show ? Pushing Daisies is , truly , pure and utter escapism . It 's colour palette , the dialogue used , the scenarios , situations , music : all of it , to me , is just an escape from everyday life . An escape from the mundane and boring . It is here where Pushing Daisies exceeds exceptionally well Pushing Daisies isn't for everyone : A large majority of the television audience don't " get " it , for some people it 's just too out there and silly . But for people like me , even from the first episode I watched of it ( Season 2 's " Frescorts " ) and I was just blown away by the show . From then on , I bought both the box sets and they have barely been out of my DVD player . Other people I know can't stand it , it really seems to be like Marmite . The show follows the adventures of Ned , the Piemaker , with a magic finger , who brings back childhood sweetheart Charlotte Charles , works in association with private investigator Emerson Cod , owns the Pie-hole and employs waitress Olive Snook . Completing the main cast members are aunts Lily and Vivian , whom Charlotte ( Chuck ) is never allowed to see . They live in a fantasy world where the dead are brought back to life , everything is shown with a wonderfully bright splash of colour , and narrated by Jim Dale . Other than outlining the basics of the show , I really can't praise it much more without saying : Just watch it . Despite being screwed over by the Writer 's Guild of America strike , with only 22 episodes ever to be made , it provides wonderful plot twists , story lines , characters and situations while providing ( for me ) a satisfying ending ( yes , I could tell it had been tacked on the end and rushed , but I was still happy with the way it went out ) . Whether it is creative or just pretentious , for a lot of people ( me included ) it made the most addictive and wonderful viewing , and I hope for the future of television that more shows like this are created so I 'm not left with just 22 , 40 minute memories of what true entertainment can be .  
0	  Amen to Magsel . There was a lot of confusion going on . First off , how do you know which movie you are purchasing ? Henry Cele stars in every one of them . I bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries .. WHAT A LETDOWN ! It would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped . David Hasselhoff ( spelling ? ) is OK for popcorn TV but he was not believable in this film ( where was his English accent ? ) AND WHAT 'S WITH THE LOVE STORY ? The movie was supposed to be about a young man 's rise to military power - not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the English maiden looking for her daddy .. If I had paid more than $ 7 for this movie , I would have to call the police - because that would be a crime !  
1	  Portrays the day to day stark reality of survival on a ranch in the old west . Outstanding acting by both principal actors . This doesn't even feel like a movie .. you feel like you 're there . Animal activists should beware .. many scenes are obviously not just realistic .. they are real .  
0	  ' Ninteen Eighty-Four ' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted . It is a very dark film , and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself . It is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self-centred . The film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours ( contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams ) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places . However , despite the film 's cleverness at portraying this idea , the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across . It seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story .  
0	  My friends and I walked out after 15 minutes , and we weren't the first . Afterwards , we tried to get our money back . Movie theater management wouldn't allow this , but they did agree to let us see another film . The only time that worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts : Former Child Star . As you can tell , this wasn't a memorable night . Probably one of my worst movie nights . Close second has to be when I saw a double header of Domestic Disturbance and Heist . In conclusion , for the sake of humanity , please don't see The Order .  
1	  I thought this movie was very well done . Taking place in the mid 1950 's , everything looked accurate to me . It was well cast and believable . I don't usually care much for this type of movie , because they just don't have any depth , but I felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt , you got to really know them and care about them . It did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time . This movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups . After the movie was over I wished there was a part two . I wanted to know what happened to Dani and her family . This movie is bound to be a classic . If you haven't seen it you should try to catch it when it is on TV or rent it ..  
1	  I loved this movie . I 'm a Mexican and was in the least offended by it . In fact , I think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over Mexico . It 's a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse . It angers me to read in the news how killers , kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells . We should have someone like Creasy , Denzel Washington 's character . A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante . Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here ( at least in the big cities ) . I actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the one 's Creasy did his fine job upon . That would be so marvelous ( Sorry , I am THAT resentful ! ) . MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you can't miss . It might be hard on some of you , if you aren't used to reading subtitles ( Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies ) but the effort will be well worth it . Some of the editing is a bit fuzzy .. kind of like TRAFFIC , remember ? ( another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is ) . The movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half . I swear you 'll be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers . His performance is nothing short of Excellent . The ending ( no spoilers , OK ! ) is a bit sad , but I 'm sure you 'll like it anyway . MAN ON FIRE is one of the year 's best movies . A " must own " for a DVD collection ! 9 * out of 10  
1	  ' The second beginning ' as it 's title explains , shows us the beginning of the end for the human race . Set long before the matrix existed , this short anime written by the Wachowski 's shows us the world that could lay infront of us in the not to distant future , set at the turn of the 21st century , the second renaissance delves into issues common with human behaviour ; greed , power , control , vanity etc . The use of robots or artificial intellegence as slaves or servents is common among science fiction / fantasy stories . The second renaissance is no exeption to this concept , however instead of a simple man vs . machine layout , this story explains the struggle that the machines put up with , the struggle for acceptance in a world ruled by humans . Where the matrix films show us the human perspective , these short animations tell both sides of the story . The second renaissance part 1 + 2 , answer many questions brought up by the original Matrix film , such as how the war broke out , how the sky was blackend , what led to the use of humans as batteries and it also introduces us to the machine city called 01 , which may have relevance to the upcoming Matrix Revolutions film . I won't give away too much of the story , as I do not want to ruin the experience for perspective viewers , however , I will recommend it to anybody interested in the world of the matrix or simply anybody interested in Japanese animation ( anime ) . 9/10 .  
0	  Spoken like a true hard-boiled u'an gangsta . The story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks , but never ever confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II , or Goodfellas . It is not in the same league . But what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these Italian Americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u'an accent . Pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him . I was looking forward to see Abrahams and Loggia , but their steenky accents spoiled the fun . Ah well , the script ain't too hot either . Don Corleone would have made this disappear five minutes after meeting him , smiling and patting him on the back all the while .  
1	  Dressed to Kill starts off with Kate Miller ( Angie Dickinson ) having a sexually explicit nightmare , later on that day she visits her psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott ( Michael Caine ) for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated & unfulfilled in her current marriage . Kate then visits a museum & picks up a stranger , they go back to his apartment for casual sex , when done Kate is set to leave but is attacked & killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman . Prostitute Liz Blake ( Nancy Allen ) discovers the gruesome scene & sees the killer but manages to escape . Detective Marino ( Dennis Franz ) says he suspects Liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so Liz teams up with Kate 's son Peter ( Keith Gordon ) to track down the real killer , clear Liz 's name & see that justice is done .. Written & directed by Brian De Palma I thought Dressed to Kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery . The script is measured & slow at times but it likes to focus on the character 's so you really know them , the entire first twenty minutes is just developing Kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off , then the film switches it 's attentions to Liz & no one else gets a look in . This way Dressed to Kill is quite absorbing & engaging , unfortunately the character 's themselves aren't exactly likable . I found some of the dialogue quite funny at times , especially the dirty talk that Liz spouts occasionally . The killers motives are somewhat plausible but I guess you 'd have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in Dressed to Kill . It 's a good film but it didn't excite me that much & I didn't really find any character to root for or like . The film tacks on a needless & unnecessary twist ending that I didn't really see the point of . Director De Palma directs with style & visual flair , from the art museum sequence to a car chase & as a whole it 's impeccably filmed throughout . I 'd imagine that every shot in Dressed to Kill had a great deal of thought put into it . I felt the film was a bit flat & uninspired at times though , nothing about it really excited me that much . There is a fair bit of nudity , some sex & rape along with a few bits of gore & violence , Kate 's murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight , if that 's the right word . However , it 's by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe . With a supposed budget of about $ 6,500,000 Dressed to Kill has that glossy high production value feel of a Hollywood film . The New York locations are nice , the cinematography is good & as a whole it 's extremely well made . I thought the music was inappropriate & was far to loud & intrusive . The acting is OK but despite his top billing I didn't think Caine had that much screen time . Allen was married to director De Palma at the time Dressed to Kill was made , interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by De Palma in two of them , this & Blow Out ( 1981 ) , he cast her as a prostitute .. A body double was used for Dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start . Dressed to Kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but I didn't think it quite lived up to it 's lofty reputation . Good but not brilliant .  
1	  Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories , Reno Hightower . Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as Jack Dundee . He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one . You 'll see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film , as Jack hisses at a rat , Reno poses , and the call of the caribou goes out . Don't miss this classic that isn't scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played .  
1	  When I rented Domino I was expected it to be very dumb . I hate films that have really flashy editing and cinematography and Domino also just got very bad reviews . The only reason I watched it is because I like have liked Keira Knightley , Mickey Rourke , Christopher Walken , and Tony Scott on other occasions . I also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories . Yes the editing and cinematography were frantic , the story was weak , and the acting was mediocre , but I still loved this film for some bizarre reason . Domino was very , very entertaining and often very funny . It was horribly underrated when it was released I think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like Scotts last film Man on Fire and instead just got wonderful entertainment . I actually understand why everybody hated Domino so much , even though I loved it and recommend it .  
0	  This film has the kernel of a really good story . The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard , especially in the North Pacific , is the stuff of heroes and legends . This film mucks up a good story with three endings ( none satisfying ) , a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged " romantic " relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire . The rescue scenes are great - even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal - but the backstory is lame and disappointing . Costner is good - especially his hand acting ( watch for it ) . Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible . The main female characters are one dimensional . The best female is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center and she 's on camera for about two minutes in the whole film . It could have been an excellent film - and Costner needs one !  
0	  In A Woman Under the Influence Mabel goes crazy , but I can see why she does go crazy . If I lived the kind of life she lived with the family she has I would go crazy too . Everyone in her family is off their rocker and not completely with it . She is constantly surrounded by people yelling at her and telling her what is best for herself and people that aren't the sharpest knifes in the drawer . To start with the one person closest to her in her life , her husband , Nick , is a little off his rocker . He is always yelling at her when he is home telling her how to live her life and to stop acting like an imbecile . The rest of the time he is working long hours at his job and he isn't there to support her when she needs support . The one person in her life that should always be there for her is never there and if he is , he is just making her feel worse . She relies on him for support and always goes to him first when she feels she is acting wrong and he does nothing to support her . When she comes home from the hospital all he does is tell her how to act , instead of comforting her , he just yells at her and tells her what to do . The other major people in her life are her parents . Her parents do nothing in her life for her . Mabel basically runs their lives because they are afraid to stand up to her and stand up for her . In the end she even asks her father to stand up for her and he doesn't understand , and when he does get it he still does nothing . They do nothing to help Mabel recover or to keep her from going crazy because they do nothing for her period . The only person that tries to do something for her is Nick 's mom . Nick 's mom is adamant about having Mabel committed . She doesn't want to have Nick deal with it so she has the doctor commit her . It seems as though everyone is against Mabel and they feel that having her committed is a good idea because then they won't have to deal with it anymore . They all want to live their own lives and do nothing for Mabel except for yell at her and make her feel like she is doing something wrong when she really isn't . That is why she went crazy , and why she had to be committed , it was her family 's entire fault .  
1	  This series premiered on the cable TV station " Comedy Central " in the United States . It was chopped to death , and shown out of sequence . This was sad for the audience it should have attracted , it didn't and fell by the wayside . Luckily , at the same time my cable company went digital and I got the BBC . Thank goodness because I got to see " The League of Gentlemen " in order , complete and uncut . " The League of Gentlemen " troupe is right up there with England 's " Monty Python 's Flying Circus " and Canada 's " The Kids in the Hall " . But .. a warning . " The League of Gentlemen " though are one step beyond . It 's not only about dressing in drag and lampooning the cultural ills , it goes deeper and much , much , darker . I can tell many of you now - it will offend certain groups of people , it will enrage others . But remember , its only comedy .. dark , dark comedy . If that is not your thing , don't watch . If you think you KNOW dark comedy , watch this - if you get angry and upset , then you don't quite know DARK COMEDY . These guys got it right , and right on the button . They are brilliant , they are excellent and I enjoyed each and every character creation . There 's a COMPLETE story that is told here from episode one to the end . You cannot watch this one episode at a time , willy nilly , that is one of the charms of this series . Watch it in order . See how creative and stylish and deeply disturbed these guys are . No one and nothing is out of bounds . That , my dears , is " dark humor " . Bravo !  
1	  First , this was a BRAVE film . I 've seen Irreversible and can understand the comparisons . However , I cannot begin to understand the people who 've trashed this film . I can see how the end may have come off extreme but I 'd be lying if I didn't say I wished that every guy who 's ever forced a woman into sex deserved exactly what Jared got . Conversely , it didn't solve anything or make anything better and the fact that the film doesn't pretend to is what made me appreciate it . The comment prior to this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would stick with . I certainly did and intently . I 'm 24 years old . The way the film drags made it realistic to me . People have become so used to eye candy and fast paced plots on screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on one brick in the foundation of a film , not only do they lose interest , they demolish whatever has been built , and call it rubbish . When in actuality it 's their lack of patience and comprehension that needs fine tuning and not the product of a creative mind such as Talia Lugacy 's . Rosario Dawson displayed the numbness of self-destruction flawlessly . I think she portrayed Maya pre and post assault with great ease and the transition between the two is an act I rarely ever see done well . Often times , much like the films " aimed at teens " mentioned in the prior comment , the effects of rape are displayed as either extremely manic and impulsive or terribly depressed , isolated and lifeless . Dawson , in my opinion , manages to perform the balancing act so many survivors fall prey to : drone-like existence in the waking hours , working some dead end job to survive ( and distract ) and then overindulging in vices in order to lose themselves in the haze of substance abuse rather than face what sobriety brings . I thought this film told the truth and I appreciated it for finally showing people a different side of rape . So many people let the end of this film devour the middle and the beginning .. I believe that Maya 's face during the act was the end .. not the act itself .. not the vengeance or the meaning behind it .. just her face .. thank you  
1	  elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies , it has every thing you would want in a film , like great one liners , sexy star and a Outrageous story ! if you have not seen it , you are missing out on one of the greatest films made . i can't wait till her new movie comes out !  
1	  It 's a road movie , with a killer on-board . Brian Kessler ( David Duchovny ) , a sophisticated , urbane writer , wants to conduct field research on American serial killers . But , neither he , nor his girlfriend , Carrie ( Michelle Forbes ) , has the money for a cross-country tour of murder sites , so they advertise for someone to share travel expenses . Who they end up with is a young couple , Early Grayce ( Brad Pitt ) and his girlfriend , Adele ( Juliette Lewis ) , two better examples of " poor white trash " you will never find in all of cinema . Indeed , Early and Adele are what make this film so entertaining , as they babble , cackle , confide , muse , speculate , drool , and otherwise behave in ways I haven't seen since reruns of " The Beverly Hillbillies " . Early 's idea of California : " People think faster out there , on account of all that warm weather ; cold weather makes people stupid " . That 's enough to convince Adele : " I guess that explains why there are so many stupid people around here " . To which Early responds proudly : " It sure does " . Early continues to instruct Adele about California : " You never have to buy no fruit , on account it 's all on the trees .. and they ain't got no speed limits , and I hear your first month 's rent is free , state law " . But poor Early has some , well , mental problems , which become ever more obvious to Brian and Carrie as the four travelers proceed west across the U.S. As they enter the desert Southwest , with its beautifully stark landscape , " Kalifornia " starts to look more and more like " The Hitcher " ( 1986 ) , and Early starts to act more and more like John Ryder , everyone 's maniacal hitchhiker , whose terror seemed so unstoppable . In " Kalifornia " , the acting is uneven . Duchovny 's performance is flat . Brad Pitt is surprisingly effective , despite his overacting at times . Michelle Forbes is great as the avant-garde , photographic artist . But my choice for best performance goes to Juliette Lewis . With her nasal voice and heavy-duty Southern accent , she is stunning , as the naive , highly animated , child-like Adele . Toward the end , the film takes on a Twilight Zone feel to it , as our travelers enter a Nevada nuclear test site with a dilapidated old house full of test mannequins . The plot dissolves rather messily into unnecessary and preposterous violence , an ending that was somewhat disappointing . Overall , however , " Kalifornia " is an entertaining film , thanks to a clever concept , great scenery , especially in the second half , good cinematography , great dialogue , and that wonderful performance by Juliette Lewis .  
1	  I can remember watching this for the first time , when I was 9 years old . I wanted to be one of the " barbarian brothers " . This movie is still great . One original aspect was that the fight scenes where very short . Implying that the " barbarian brothers " where so good that they finished there enemies off quickly ! Plus , you have chases , a cage fight , a dragon , and yes even a bar brawl ! Yes , the acting is bad so that 's why it 's not a ten , also the story line has received a lot of criticism . I think it is quite original . Not to many movies in it 's genre have the same original story lines , or colorful dialogue . I definitely recommend this film .  
1	  It 's true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes . And none more so that September 11 , 2001 , a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism . No , this documentary didn't set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9/11 . Rather , the filmmakers , brothers Gédéon and Jules Naudet , set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie New York firefighter . They had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training , and had handpicked their " proby " ( probation firefighter ) to join them in an NY firehouse , home to Ladder 1 and Engine 7 . But their production was to develop and contain at that time , believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the World Trace Center . I was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of LAN gaming , and received a call at about 850pm local time from my Dad , who informed me of the above . Few minutes later , he told me there was another , and that the WTC was under attack . By the time I arrived home , the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke , and to my horror , they collapsed , under an hour . The filmmakers had two cameras running that day , one who had followed a team out on a routine call , and which immediately raced to the WTC upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it . We follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of WTC1 where the first responders of firefighters , paramedics , and police had to make sense of what happened , and to quickly develop a plan of action . The other camera , held by the other brother , was making his way to WTC to look for his sibling , and along the journey , captured the many expressions of New Yorkers , as well as the sense of chaos in and around Manhatten . Peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from Ladder 1 and Engine 7 , which miraculously , did not suffer any casualty . But being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil , as they struggle to come to terms with the event . Through the events that unfold , we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs , to save lives . We began with what the documentary was supposed to be , before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus , right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures . It 's not a film that is fabricated , and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary ( and heavens , not sound stages for Hollywood blockbusters ) . It 's as close as you can get to that day , witnessing the event up close , from safety . Code 1 DVD contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7 .  
1	  This game is the bomb and this is the 007 game of the year and should be on greatest hits . When I got Agent Under Fire , I thought that was a good game but then Nightfire came around and that was better , but now there is a new type of James Bond game . This time it a 3rd person shooter and there is more than 12 missions , the graphics of the game are out of this house . It even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like Pierce Bronsan as once again James Bond , William Dafoe as the villain Nikolai Diavolo , and Judi Dench as M ( forgive me all if I spell it wrong ) . This game would be own as the greatest James Bond game around . I give this a 10/10  
0	  If they could get Ed Asner why didn't they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers ? And why did the protagonist throw the wise old sage character to the ground when he was never in danger . It forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride and so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a life long disability . I guess thats why the main character refuses money though and why the old guy works him like a dog even when he volunteers for extra work . If the d-bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is long-distance boyfriend then why is a soldier any better . He has good reason to be jealous , good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective , controlling manipulative father . All the characters that are meant to be likable aren't and everyone else is the ' bad ' boyfriend . How did they meet anyway , a wine broker and a saw mill worker ?  
1	  A dying Kung Fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned Poison Clan . He is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them The master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the clans money which the master wants used for good . The earlier students were all taught in a different style snake , centipede , scorpion , lizard , toad , while the last student was taught a little in each style . All of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the money , and soon everyone is battling to get the money . Classic martial arts film has title that even many non-fans know . I 've spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head . Its a very good movie , though I 'm not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the Shaw studio ( One armed Swordmen or the Brave Archer series for example ) . This isn't to sell the film short , its not , since the film is structured like a mystery , our hero has no clue who anyone is and the Venoms themselves only know at best who two of the others is . We 're given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is . The film is also odd in that for a martial arts film , other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money , there is really no action for about 40 or 45 minutes . Its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention . ( The film is also odd in that its the first martial arts film I think I 've ever seen where there are no women . I don't think one has a speaking role and I 'm pretty sure that none appear in the background . Its indicative of nothing , its just something that struck me . ) This is a good solid little film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles , but is still a really good film to curl up with on your couch . Around 7 out of 10 .  
1	  This is a very difficult movie , and it 's almost impossible to get a handle on what 's going on . At first it seems to be a rather pedestrian movie about a guy ( Trelkovsky ) who needs an apartment and rather crassly invites himself into one when the current tenant ( a woman ) commits suicide . Then the twists and turns start . Are the neighbors trying to kill him ? And why are the dead tenant 's clothes turning up in the apartment ? One wonders , finally , if Trelkovksy _ is _ the prior tenant . SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER One of the tricks Polanski pulls on us is to lie to us . We assume when we see things from the point of view of a character that we see things as the character does and that there may be distortions of reality . We assume when the camera is showing us things from its omniscient point of view that we see actuality - but Polanski has the camera lie to us .  
1	  I sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of Hitchcock 's lesser known films , because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden Hitchcock gem or a true Hitchcock great or some other generic if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - Hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc . So , that being said , I would just like to say that if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - Hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - Vertigo - North - by - Northwest - Psycho - Rear - Window - etc . Now , that may be overshooting a little bit , The Ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above , but compared to the other films that Hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s , I really think that The Ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them . As an almost brand new director , there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why Hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career . Granted , the film does start with , among other things , the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer ( and I use idiot in the definitive manner , the way Stephen King so often does ) having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people . I suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then , but I think it is one of the most off-putting sequences in any Hitchcock film I 've seen . The main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round , but when he meets his match , it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife 's finger . So begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman , who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly . ( spoilers ) There is , for example , a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and , just before going into the building , she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss . This kiss is never explained , and there is also the fact that , even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband , or at least ultimately chooses him , they look into each other 's eyes but do not actually kiss . The film is certainly beautifully photographed , even more so than several films that Hitch released in subsequent years . There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as One Round Jack 's trainer who , in his stone faced expressionism , reminds me quite often of the brilliant Buster Keaton . Hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous , but this is a great sample of his early work .  
1	  For me , this is one of the best movies i ever saw . Overcoming racism , struggling through life and proving himself he isn't just an ordinary " cookie " , Carl Brashear is an amazing character to play , who puts Cuba in his best light , best performance in his life . De Niro , who is a living legend gives THAT SOMETHING to the movie . Hated his character in movie , but he gives so much good acting to this film , great performance . And appearance of beautiful Charlize was and as always is a big plus for every movie . So if you haven't seen this movie i highly recommended for those who love bravery , greatness who seek inspiration . You must look this great drama . My Vote 9/10 .  
0	  Alicia Silverstone ( pre - " Clueless " ) plays a modern-day crime-obsessed teenager attempting to solve the brutal slaying of a local girl . Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-flick , which isn't especially well-made but is however surprisingly serious-minded in regards to its leading character . Silverstone is appealing and successful in carving out an interesting young woman here , despite the picture 's kitschy undermining . The supporting cast ( including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen ) isn't bad , though the violence in the last act goes overboard . Not a cheesy camp-fest , but nothing exceptionally memorable either . * 1/2 from *  
0	  I regret every single second of the time I lost while watching this movie , really . Unhappily , I always find it hard to switch off a movie once I started watching it . Especially , when it 's such a classic or what people use to call a classic . I think that this is one of those movies every movie-lover should have watched at least one time , so that was why I watched it . Don't get me wrong , I like Humphrey Bogart and his wife Lauren Bacall both as a couple and as actors , but this movie was a big fraud in my opinion . No really good plot , neither an espionage flick nor a romantic love story . Well , not even a convincing mixture of both of these genres . Only thing which caused tension was that it was uncertain whether ' Bogey ' and Bacall would stay together in the end or part from one another . I think " To Have and Have Not " is very overrated and Bogart was in many better films during the 1940s .  
0	  Having enjoyed Jean Arthur in " The Devil and Miss Jones " , my interest was peaked , so I tried sitting through this second-string screwball outing about an investigation into the death of a jockey-but I didn't make it to the end . Arthur , photographed in a gauzy , movie-magazine fashion , either wants alimony from ex-husband William Powell or another shot at marriage , but I never felt for her because the character is just a string of wisecracks ( she 's the type of heroine prone to comical curiousness , but once inside a morgue-like all women in these ' 30 's comedies-she faints ) . William Powell reportedly had a high time working with Miss Arthur , but you 'd never know it from the end result ; they look awkward standing next to each other , hesitant over their banter . The actor playing Powell 's valet is excruciating , and the pauses for viewer laughs are pregnant with unease .  
0	  Any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake . Alex Baldwin trying to imitate the late Steve Mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn't work . While Baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish . McQueen had charisma , never try to compete with a star . As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw enough said . McQueen looked dangerous , menacing and believable as Doc , the film had excitement and suspense , Baldwin and company made this into a comedy , I laughed the one and only time I saw this miserable film . And that dreadful hairstyle for Michael Madsen who is one of today 's more exciting and believable actors ! Did the makeup people have it in for Michael , what were they thinking . If you wish to see movie-making the way it was under Sam Peckinpah 's direction Get the original !  
1	  The show is about two sisters living together . Holly being the younger one has some teenage problems on the other hand her sister Val has job , boy friend , fiancé problems like most of the women on the planet . They try to support each other they make mistakes sometimes but they don't give up and continue . And the show is also about friendship . The priorities in life . I loved this show so much . It is funny and the actors are so good . I am really sad that the show is over . I still watch the reruns time to time :) Amanda Bynes is very talented . Jenny Garth may be new to comedy but she plays really well . She is one of the actresses i like watching . I like Vince and Holly 's relationship they are very natural . Gary is a natural talent and makes you laugh each time he shows up . With Tina Holly found a real friend and i really like them hanging out . Lauren character is so funny and she is a natural talent . I would like to see her more . This show really takes you in and makes you laugh . I wish the show hasn't been over .  
1	  I am not going to spoil the contents to anyone , who has not yet watched this humble masterpiece by Kay Pollak . A world famous conductor brilliantly played by Michael Nyqvist seeks peace from stress by moving back to his childhood village . The villagers , who has followed the genius in silence , are slowly tempting him to share of his greatness . Each role in this movie , has a very specific purpose and shows a remarkable potential in each of the actors playing their own chord in short but precise words , a symphony of love . Not love in the sense of relationship , but in the tone of the spirit deeply buried within each of the characters , each revealing their own present story , their needs , their skeletons , desires and much more . I shall not forget to mention , the two main parts played by Frida Hallgren and Michael Nyqvist , whose dramas are played in unforgettable harmonies of emotional feedback . They touch each other with a pain connected in their own disability to love themselves . Michael Nyqvist is really put to the test here in a very difficult setup , in one of those movies that either end up as catastrophic or fantastic . And fantastic it became from start to end , not one second less or more than enough , you are left with a feeling of change and a taste for more . To this day , definitely one of the best movies I have had the pleasure of watching .  
1	  With a well thought out cast , this movie was a great comedic relief . The plot is well-written and the cast was knockout . Every bit as good as the reviews suggested ( a rarity ) and was highly entertaining . Being a huge John Candy fan myself , this movie was no disappointment .  
1	  In anticipation of Ang Lee 's new movie " Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon , " I saw this at blockbuster and figured I 'd give it a try . A civil war movie is not the typical movie I watch . Luckily though , I had a good feeling about this director . This movie was wonderfully written . The dialogue is in the old southern style , yet doesn't sound cornily out of place and outdated . The spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie . Toby Maguire was awesome . I thought he was good ( but nothing special ) in Pleasantville , but here he shines . I have always thought of Skeet Ulrich as a good actor ( but nothing special ) , but here he is excellent as well . The big shocker for me was Jewel . She was amazingly good . Jeffrey Wright , who I had never heard of before , is also excellent in this movie . It seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand . A movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and visa versa . This movie had the perfect combination . The actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular . This movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others . It lets you really get to know the characters , which are all very dynamic and interesting . The plot is complex , and keeps you on the edge of your seat , guessing , and ready for anything at any time . Literally dozens of times I was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were " too quiet " ( brilliant directing ) . This was also a beautifully shot movie . The scenery was not breath taking ( It 's in Missouri and Kansas for goodness sakez ) but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings . Has that rough and rugged feel , but keeps an elegance , which is very pleasant on the eyes . The movie was deep . It told a story and in doing so made you think . It had layers underneath that exterior civil war story . Specifically , it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for . There were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie , too many to pick out . It was like a beautifully written short story , filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done . If you like great acting , writing , lots of action , and some of the best directing ever , see this movie ! Take a chance on it .  
0	  This is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic , genre defining MASTERPIECE , Jaws . Yes , brainiac , great whites ( and other species of shark , bull , black-tip , oceanic white-tip , tiger ) have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found . Humans don't often make it onto that menu , granted , but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior . It 's not like it 's never happened . The odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town , singling out a human nemesis , sinking several dozen thick hulled North Atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people , all friends of the aforementioned " nemesis " , are close enough to the water for it to reach , are so slim as to be laughable . Much like this turd of a Jaws knock-off . Laughable . Great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats , protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards , as they look like seals from below . A shark the size of Bruce ( if you don't know , look it up ) would be more than capable of sinking a boat like The Orca ( hey ! that 's the name of the blatant rip-off we 're discussing ! ) , as it would weigh upwards of 6,000 lbs . I could go on , but I don't need to . Jaws is amazing ( better acting , better effects , better music , better writing ) , Orca is crap ( BLATANT rip-off of Jaws , lousy writing , abominable effects , most ridiculous plot this side of an Olson Twins flick ) . It doesn't take a masters from Columbia University to see that . Watch better movies .  
1	  This is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching . The story is engaging and it doesn't take long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin grabs your attention . The acting is first class and the characters are represented well . Sometimes it feels like the director couldn't decide himself between drama and romantic comedy . Ben Chiller 's portrayal of the law abiding and shy Englishman with porn S.M. magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs ! As does the look in Nicole Kidman 's eyes when she is offering John his first taste of intimacy in a long time .. Other times the actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant .  
1	  The case of the Scorpion 's tail is a highly stylish giallo directed by Sergio Martino , who appears to be a giallo master second only to Dario Argento . Ernesto Gastaldi wrote this fabulous who-dunnit , quite complex but ultimately very satisfying and entertaining murder mystery . It also makes sense in the end , a big plus , ' cause that 's not always the case for these giallo 's , as they tend to stretch credibility with their endless red-herrings and ultimate solutions . Here , the less you know about the plot , the better . Pure giallo trademarks present here are the beautiful cinematography , the catchy music score , the gorgeous females ( Anita Strindberg is a goddess ) , brutal murders , black gloved murderers and explicit sex scenes to name a few . In most parts it 's decently acted , Goerge Hilton his usually suave self and others do fairly well . Martino directs with a sure hand , keeps things tight and atmospheric with some terrific set pieces . If you 're a giallo fan , this is a must see . If you like well written and suspenseful thrillers in general , this comes highly recommended .  
1	  Putting the UFO " thing " aside . This was the best documentary I 've seen . Factual reporting by Neil and Buzz .. a must see . The interviews and reporting are a revelation since most of the information was stamped confidential in 1969 and only released in 2006 . No documentary to date has the detail or accuracy for such a brief 47 minutes .. The FACTS will blow you away , and you will be left in awe of the risks taken to be the first on the moon .. Neil and Buzz are probably the biggest hero 's of our time . Ever see a man save his own life ? Bet not . Neil saves his life when only mili-seconds separated him from death . Amazing to watch . It is a travesty people have not known all the details assosiated with landing on the moon and the courage those men had when facing certain death , from a failing computer .. 10 stars !  
1	  An ok movie about downs syndrome . A mother has twins one is very sick the other is good but he has downs . The mother does not think she can raise him so she gives him to some people who have 15 kids 11 have downs ! the mom does not like this & she thinks he should be with his family ( I agree too ) so they take it to court & the family gets broken up & the grandparents lose , it never really says if the mom & daughter makeup ? I think this movie 's good but the plot is familiar , it 's still good & has a few unintentional laughs !  
0	  All this dismaying waste of film stock needs is Count Floyd popping up every sixty seconds . Somehow they got Steve Railsback , Susan Anspach , John Vernon , and Joe Flaherty together on a set and couldn't get within five miles , about eight kilometers , of an actual movie . BOY does this thing suck . There isn't one original line , thought , shot , or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close . The magical , ethereal Susan Anspach of Five Easy Pieces - boring . Steve Railsback - boring . John Vernon - boring . The big bug - boring . If this is a scary movie , Buttercream Gang is a thuglife documentary . Seriously - every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness . Usually it 's in the opening credits - " Written , Directed , and Produced by " one guy . Or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there 's one and only one reason this turkey got made . Here , you don't find out till the very last of the credits , where the cooperation of about a dozen subfunctions of the Canadian Government is gratefully acknowledged . Right now I 'm watching MST 's take on Beast of Yucca Flats to get the taste out of my mouth . Ghod , what an improvement .  
1	  This is an awesome action film with great one liners from Arnie ! . It 's stylishly made , with lots of tense action to keep one satisfied . The Characters were awesome , and Richard Dawson , is very menacing as the main villain . Yes it has tons of plot holes , however it 's highly highly entertaining , with a great ending as well . It had a great story , too it , and Arnie and Maria Conchita Alonso had great chemistry together . The Character development was also pretty good , with , some superb performances . The Directing is great ! . Paul Michael Glaser , does a very good job here , with awesome use of colors , keeping it stylish throughout , awesome camera angles , and overall keeping the film at a very fast pace ! good job . There is a little bit of gore . We get a few bloody gunshot wounds , exploding head , slit throat , bloody chainsaw slices , skinless corpses , blood , and an impaling . The Acting is great ! . Arnold Schwarzenegger is AMAZING as always , he is excellent in the acting department , has tons of hilarious one liners , kicks that ass , and as always is a big physical presence ! , and was tons of fun to watch ! ( Arnie Rules ! ) . Maria Conchita Alonso , does well here , she was really cute , and had good chemistry with Arnie ! . Yaphet Kotto , is decent here , with what he has to do , which is not much . Marvin J. McIntyre , is good as the geeky type guy , he was cool ! . Richard Dawson is awesome as the main villain , and was very very menacing , and he was fun to watch . Jesse Ventura , Jim Brown , Erland van Lidth , Gus Rethwisch , and Professor Toru Tanaka , all do what they have to do very well as the stalkers . Overall a MUST see ! * 1/2 out of 5  
1	  While this movie 's style isn't as understated and realistic as a sound version probably would have been , this is still a very good film . In fact , it was seen as an excellent film in its day , as it was nominated for the first Best Picture Oscar ( losing to WINGS ) . I still consider WINGS to be a superior film , but this one is excellent despite a little bit of overacting by the lead , Emil Jannings . Jannings is a general from Czarist Russia who is living out his final days making a few bucks in the 1920s by being a Hollywood extra . His luck appears to have changed as he gets a casting call-to play an Imperial Russian general fighting against the Communists during the revolution . Naturally this isn't much of a stretch acting-wise , but it also gets the old man to thinking about the old days and the revolution . Exactly what happens next I 'll leave to you , but it 's a pretty good film-particularly at the end . By the way , look for William Powell as the Russian director . Despite being made in 1928 , with the makeup he doesn't look much younger than he did in many of his later films .  
0	  The main reason people still care about " Carlton-Browne Of The F.O. " is that it features Peter Sellers in a second-billed role . But watching this film to see Peter Sellers is a mistake . Sellers plays Amphibulos , a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirt-poor island nation of Gaillardia , formerly a British colony , now hosting a lot of Russian diggers during the height of the Cold War . Amphibulos wants to play both U.K. and Soviet interests against each other for easy profit , " everything very friendly and all our cards under the table " . Terry-Thomas is the title character , a lazy British diplomat anxious to show Gaillardia that Great Britain hasn't forgotten them , all appearances to the contrary . A positive review here says : " The reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated . " I would argue that the reason " Carlton-Browne " is considered below average is because the comedy is non-existent . After a decent opening that establishes the film 's only two strengths , a sympathetically doltish Terry-Thomas and John Addison 's full-on larky score , things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes . The low opinion of Carlton-Browne by his boss and the obscurity of Gaillardia ( which no one can find on a map ) is milked to death . By the time we actually reach the island ( after a labored series of airsick jokes ) , expectations are quite low . They 're still too high , though . The island itself , which seems to exist either in Latin America or the Mediterranean , is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport , and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade . The army is apparently still horse drawn , allowing for another lame aural gag by a thick-accented announcer : " In war , the army uses many horse . " Sellers never quite takes center stage even when we 're on his character 's island . The plot is taken over instead by Ian Bannen as King Loris , who inherits the throne of Gaillardia after his father 's assassination . Bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written . Normally this would make him the likely target for scene-stealing by Sellers , but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache , Sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year , " The Mouse That Roared " and " I 'm All Right , Jack . " Strange that this film , like " Jack " , was a Boulting Brothers production , with Roy Boulting here serving as co-director alongside Jeffrey Dell . Usually Boulting films combine wicked social satire with anything-goes comedy , but here there are only fey jabs in either direction . Amphibulos works his mangled-English vibe for all its worth ( " This man is like , how do you say , the bull in the Chinese ship " ) while Carlton-Browne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve . The weakest and most protracted element of the film is young Loris 's romance with Ilyena . Score one point for her being played by ravishing Luciana Paluzzi , dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed . The film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one , and a final bit of action by Carlton-Browne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally . Apparently he lives to see another day , but the film of the same name is strictly DOA .  
0	  I looked forward to watching this film and then realised that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was swamped by the unnecessary swearing . Now I am not a prude in any way , but to shout obscenities at each other does not a good film make . Ewan Bremner is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at this time ( witness his performance in the god awful Life of Stuff ) & his " Cockney " accent is almost as bad as his Edinburgh accent . Avoid . How many more of these films " Kiss Kiss Bang Bang " , " Beautiful Creatures " do we have to suffer before the film makers realise that the f-word , the c- word etc does not replace proper dialogue .  
1	  I watch movies for a living , picking out which ones are good enough to distribute .. Tossing aside those that don't make the cut . I 'm not saying that I know more than anyone else based on this , I 'm just leading you to how I came to watch " The Gospel of Lou " .. Anyways .. So many bad movies land on my desk and I actually sit through all of them . I don't actually " watch " everything , usually I just look over at the TV occasionally while I 'm working the scan for production value , performance , and how well the story is being presented . If something catches my eye I 'll take the time to watch it . " Lou " drew me in during the first few minutes where I closed my laptop and wheeled my chair over to the TV so I could completely tune in . Needless to say I was enthralled throughout the whole movie . The story is told well , the characters are either endearing or repulsive ( depending of course on the actor and directors intention for the character ) and all very well played . At times I caught occasional amateur mistakes in the camera work and editing , but the emotional nature of the story make these faults easy to dismiss . I 've heard other people 's comments say that at times the film brought tears to their eyes , other time extreme elation .. I was laughing one minute and crying the next and was incredibly touched by this movie . Sadly I was unable to acquire it because I was - as the saying goes - a week late and a dollar short . That 's the way it goes sometimes .. but at least I had the pleasure of seeing this one and I can't wait to see what kind of response it gets . Good luck and great fortune to you Bret Carr ( if you read this ) , you are without a doubt a talent to watch for .  
0	  I just saw this film tonight and I have to say that it 's a mess . I love Vince Vaughn but he ends up more annoying that funny here and the film is more than less a remake of the crappy 80 's classic " Santa Claus the movie " but with out the camp or the bad Sheena Easton song at the end . . The story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but with North Pole as its setting . Of course Fred ( Vince Vaughn ) is the family screw up who comes home after a series of set backs that include his girlfriend ( Rachel Weisz in a cameo role ) dumping him , so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother Santa Claus ( Paul Giamatti ) and wacky high jinks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarky as well that threatens all of Christmas . Now if you think you know the ending of this film , I think you would be right because it 's predicable to the hill . As for the acting , Vince Vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but this time he ends up more annoying than likable , Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus but the role is more than less one note , Elizabeth Banks plays Santa 's assistant but she 's not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor Kevin Spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the film " Glengarry Glen Ross " but a little more anal . The only two actors who come out of this film with their dignity intact is Paul Giamatti , who brings a real sincerity and warmed to his role as Santa Claus but he looks somewhat embarrass to be in the movie and you can't blame him and Rachel Weisz , who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with theirs , which is a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved a lot better than what this script gave them . To put it in a nutshell , a major disappointment .  
1	  I haven't seen BSG , I tried to watch it once in the middle of the show but couldn't get into it . However , I saw Caprica Rebirth yesterday I felt a little lost , so I decided to watch the Pilot today and I must say I was pleasantly surprised . I think this is a promising show and the only side effect it had on me is that now I want to watch BSG as well . But what I really liked is that I didn't have to be a hardcore BSG fan to understand what 's going on in Caprica . From what I have read in the net , they were trying to reach the female population since BSG reached way more men , and at least in my case it worked . However , I suggest that if you are trying to watch the show do it from the beginning starting with the Pilot .  
0	  The script is nice . Though the casting is absolutely non-watchable . No style . the costumes do not look like some from the High Highbury society . Comparing Gwyneth Paltrow with Kate Beckinsale I can only say that Ms . Beckinsale speaks British English better than Ms . Paltrow , though in Ms . Paltrow 's acting lies the very nature of Emma Woodhouse . Mr. Northam undoubtedly is the best Mr. Knightley of all versions , he is romantic and not at all sharp-looking and unfeeling like Mr. Knightley in the TV-version . P.S.The spectator cannot see at all Mr. Elton-Ms . Smith relationship 's development as it was in the motion version , so one cannot understand where was all Emma 's trying of make a Elton-Smith match ( besides of the portrait ) .  
1	  My , Kasi Lemmings certainly is a fair looking woman . This film is a lost gem , a dead-on satire " mockumentary " of the early 90 's Hip Hop scene , when MC Hammer had just began to fade away into that good night . We follow the three members of the NWH as they embark upon their picaresque journey of would-be riches and fame . And like Nickolas Nickleby , at the end , they finish their journey not far from where they started , but at least a little wiser and lot less naive . This is one of the best films that no one has ever heard of , but it 's the kind of film you either love or hate , a lot like " Company Man " in this regard . I regard this movie like the 1000 islands of upstate New York : it 's a wonderful little secret you want to keep to yourself .  
1	  Nick Nolte gives an excellent performance in Kurt Vonnegut 's dark tale . Notle plays Howard W. Campbell who was a double agent working in propaganda during World War II . After the war , he lives anonymously until competing factions wish to dig up his past . As with much of Vonnegut 's work , this is a meditation on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own aims . Nolte is fantastic - self assured and confident as the younger Campbell , and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to atone for the sins of his past . ( 7 out of 10 )  
1	  First of all I am a butch , straight white male . But even with that handicap I love this movie . It 's about real people . A real time and place . And of course New York City in the 80 's . I had many gay friends growing up in New York in the eighties and the one thing about them i always admired was their courage to live their lives the way they wanted to live them . No matter what the consequences . That 's courageous . You have to admire that . This is a great film , watch it and take in what it was like to be a flamboyant African American or Hispanic Gay man in the New York of the eighties . It 's real life . Bottom line it 's real life .  
0	  Probably the worst film I 've ever seen , the acting and story were terrible and I almost fell asleep . The only good actor was Colm Meaney . I had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end , no emotion , no charisma .. nothing !  
1	  The most agile fat guy in martial arts does it again . An early Sammo film that has him imitating his character 's hero , Bruce Lee , Sammo is amazingly Lee like in his actions and fighting . The way he slips into Bruce 's style and then back to his own , more familiar kung fu is a joy to watch and shows how accomplished and adaptable he is at his art . Throw in a bit of slapstick humour so beloved of this type of flick and this a movie that has it all - comedy ( some unintentional , like the fake black guy ) , action and some incredible fight scenes . A great beer and buddies movie that is worth an hour and a half of anyone 's time .  
0	  I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it . The fat guy is the best character , as he seems to be a nice guy . The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men . I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year 's attitudes and fads . Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls . Most low-budget movies have that " local babe " quality , and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys . Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the " youngsters " went wild over what was essentially some really over-used , high-mileage skank . There were some cuties too . That is the charm of these low-budget crappy movies . You will see a lot of doggies , and some real cuties ! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit . Too bad . It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a " Where are they now " book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return . What happened ? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder " what ever happened to X ? " Anyhow , this movie mostly blows , but it has some funny moments .  
1	  Melvyn Douglas and Joan Blondell co-star in " The Amazing Mr. Williams , " a 1939 mystery / comedy that 's quite good , although forgotten , probably due to the number of incredible films that came out in 1939 . Douglas plays a talented police detective married to his job , while his girlfriend waits for a wedding that is constantly postponed . What happens in this film is no exception - he 's called to a murder scene just as he 's about to walk down the aisle yet again . Both stars were excellent at comedy , worked together well ( and often ) , and help make this battle of the sexes fun . Edward Brophy and Donald McBride are on hand for excellent support . As you can read in other reviews , Melvyn Douglas doesn't make much of a woman . Entertaining if a little on the long side . One of the comments here trashed Melvyn Douglas , one of our greatest actors . He literally floated effortlessly through dozens of films as the other man and the best friend before coming into his own in films as an old man . He wasn't lazy , but rather , a very hard-working actor ( who made it look easy ) who had a Broadway career simultaneously with his film career . He just wasn't cast as a leading man in films or given very challenging roles under the studio system . I challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in " Hud " and " I Never Sang for my Father " and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk .  
1	  The best part of An American In Paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end , where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living personification of several major painters . Kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in Paris , so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy , Gershwin tunes , and cast members like Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant . Kelly was at his best here - it 's a little different to Singin ' in the Rain , and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor . No wonder the sequence ended ' That 's Entertainment ' after all other MGM musical highlights had gone by !  
0	  Okay , what the hell kind of TRASH have I been watching now ? " The Witches ' Mountain " has got to be one of the most incoherent and insane Spanish exploitation flicks ever and yet , at the same time , it 's also strangely compelling . There 's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and I even doubt there ever was a script to work with , but somehow I couldn't turn it off . The scratching your head with confusion starts right away , with an opening sequence about an angry little girl that killed her mother 's cat . So you think this film revolves on children possessed by evil forces ? Heck no , because after this intro , the girl and her wickedness simply aren't mentioned anymore . Then cut to a guy , with the most impressively trimmed mustache you 'll ever see , who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather unsubtle way . When she asks him to spend his vacation with her , he promptly phones his employer requesting him any type of assignment ! Great move . The movie finally starts now , as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks . Though not before he picks up a new girl ( Patty Shepard ) and photographs her topless ! Throughout their journey , all kind of strange events occur that  you guessed it  are never explained . The girl wakes up in the middle of the forest , loud petrifying music plays everywhere and someone even steals the jeep ! Really , car jacking witches ? Apparently a coven of silent witches owns the mountains and they practice voodoo on trespassers . That 's as close as I get describing the plot , but there 's a good chance I 'm way off More important here is the atmosphere ! " The Witches ' Mountain " is occasionally very creepy , with its spooky music and interesting cinematography . The supportive characters all look uncanny and the ravishing Patty Shepard plays a good heroine . This is the type of European horror film that could have been legendary , if only someone had bothered to write a structured screenplay .  
0	  The only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by Clint Eastwood , whose work I admire immensely . The leads had absolutely no chemistry . Not for a second could I believe that there was anything deeper than lust between them . The story just didn't ring true . Add to that stilted conversation , tons of stereotypes , and an incredibly slow plot that basically leads nowhere , and you 've got yourself a real stinker . Kay Lenz 's nude scenes might be worthwhile for those seeking some salacious fare , but otherwise this is a colossal waste of time . My thoughts as I watched the movie was that itwould have been better titled " Cheesy . "  
1	  It 's a gentle , easy-going 1950s comedy . Kim Novak belongs to a coven of witches in Manhattan . She puts a spell on neighbor Jimmy Stewart out of boredom but eventually falls in love with him , losing her powers . See , witches are permitted to have " hot blood " but not love . Elsa Lanchester is Novak 's aunt , also a witch . Jack Lemmon is her brother , ditto . Hermione Gingold is the chief witch , and Ernie Kovacks is Sidney Redlich , an author who specializes in writing about witches . I described it as a 1950s comedy because it could hardly be mistaken for anything else . Everything is so smooth and polished , from the set decoration , through wardrobe and plot , to the performances and direction . Take the character of Ernie Kovacks . He 's referred to as " a drunk and a nut . " And here 's how the movie demonstrates these traits . He asks for a second drink , and , though he always wears a jacket and tie like the other gentlemen , his hair is a bit long and tousled . That 's a strictly 1950s version of a drunk and a nut . Nothing is out of place ; everything is tidy and free of dust . The soles of Jimmy Stewart 's shoes are barely scuffed . And the Zodiac Club , where the witches hang out . It 's called " a low dive . " Yet it 's a clean , dark place with polite waiters , a quintet of musicians , neatly dressed clientèle , and potted plants against bare brick walls . That is not my idea or yours of a " low dive " - not even for Greenwich Village in 1958 . My idea of a dive in Greenwich Village is Julius 's or The White Horse Tavern or The San Remo or The Swing Rendezvous , a now defunct lesbian hangout . The Zodiac Club is a high dive compared to these . The kookiness we always hear about is muted by today 's standards . I mean , Kim Novak is odd because she runs around her apartment in her bare feet . And she wears a lot of black clothes like the Beatniks of the period did . But never mind all that . It 's an enjoyable romantic comedy . Kim Novak is effective as Gillian , who runs a primitive art shop for the uptrodden . She has a strange beauty , bulky and ethereal at the same time . She glides rather than walks , a wispy presence . Her eyebrows seem drawn with a set of plastic French curves . And Jimmy Stewart is quite good as the bewildered and bewitched victim . In the 1930s he usually played in light roles . In the postwar years and for much of the 1950s he was the tortured protagonist , but here he puts his early experience in comedy to good use . Who could resist laughing when Hermione Gingold forces him to wear a shawl and drink a hideous concoction of putrid fluid in order to cure him of Novak 's spell ? It 's good to see him as a stooge instead of the angry and indignant man of principle he was in danger of becoming . Richard Quine directs the movie quietly , without fireworks or special effects , and does some interesting things that the play couldn't have had . Note the scene in which Novak casts the spell over Stewart , when the Siamese cat 's face and ears seem to merge with Novak 's startling eyes . Ernie Kovacks in the 1950s was a well-known television personality . There was never anything quite like The Ernie Kovacks Show before - or after . It brings the word " surrealism " to mind . He could stage five minutes worth of wordless and indescribable tricks in an unpopulated room with only Bartok 's Concerto for Orchestra as background . And he did an unimpeachable sketch using the character of Percy Dovetail , an effete poet . The credits kind of skip over The Condoli Brothers but that 's rather casual because these two guys - Pete and Conte - were virtuoso trumpeters with independent careers in jazz ensembles . Conte was later a member of Doc Severison 's band on Johnny Carson 's Late Show . The third act kind of bogs down a little and becomes more " romantic " than " comedy " . But it 's never dull . The whole film rolls along as neatly as Van Druten 's play and the kids will probably get a kick out of it too .  
1	  While rehearing Carmen of Bizet , the middle-aged choreographer Antonio ( Antonio Gades ) brings the sexy Carmen ( Laura del Sol ) to perform the lead role . Antonio falls in love for Carmen , who is an independent and seductive woman incapable to accept a possessive love . When Carmen has an affair with another dancer , Antonio is consumed by his jealousy like D. José in the original opera , entwining fiction with reality . " Carmen " is another great movie of Carlos Saura 's trilogy dedicated to the Flamenco dance . The dramatic love story is developed with the lives of the artists entwined with the characters they are rehearsing , and many times is not absolutely clear whether what is happening is reality ( with the dancers ) or fiction ( of the play ) . Paco de Lucia is another attraction of this original version of the famous Bizet 's opera , which is based on the novel of Prosper Mérimée . My vote is seven . Title ( Brazil ) : " Carmen "  
1	  " Stories of the Century " was a half hour series and appeared in first run syndication during the ' 54-'55 television season . It was also the first western TV series to win an Emmy award . Starring veteran western actor Jim Davis as railroad detective Matt Clark , the series set Clark and his fellow railroad detective partners ( Mary Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as " Jonesy " during the second half ) against historic western outlaws of various periods ranging from the mid-1860 's to the early 1900 's . The series was very satisfying , easy to watch , and fairly realistic due mainly to the easygoing charm of Jim Davis in the lead role . He seemed like an actual western character . One other note . When Matt Clark would arrive in town after a long ride he actually looked like he had been on a long horse ride as he would be covered in dust . A very good early adult western .  
0	  Well what I can say about this movie is that it 's great to see so many Asian faces . What I didn't like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role . The Asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead , the white guy infatuated with Asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the " keeping it real " black cab driver . Plus all the coke , shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious . The story plot itself was fun but pretty much how I thought the story would unravel . Then again when watching romantic comedies you can't expect much but then again I would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once . The parents are the best part of the flick .  
0	  Another day stuck indoors , another film to watch . Having finally completed my Christmas shopping yesterday on a cold and foggy afternoon , I had nowhere else to go to escape " The Land That Time Forgot " . Or rather , I had nothing else to watch . Doug McClure , that bastion of leading-man actors , leads a handful of Allied sailors sunk by a U-Boat somewhere in the Atlantic in 1916 . Capturing the U-Boat ( in a scene that defies logic and reason ) , they eventually find themselves on a strange island , apparently untouched by human hands . Together , they explore the land and discover dinosaurs and Neanderthals ! Can they escape before becoming a permanent resident of the land that Time forgot ? Despite being made few years before " Star Wars " , these films are light-years apart in terms of special effects . The model shots are little better than anything you would expect to see in an episode of Gerry Anderson 's " Stingray " and the creatures aren't much better either . When the T-Rex ( I 'm assuming that 's what it was ) was killed , it fell in the same way that zombies do when you kill them - frozen in mid-walk and collapsing , arms and legs held out like a sleeping cow that 's been pushed over . Granted , the sets aren't too bad but the lousy acting and endless explosion noises ( which all sound the same ) do their best to ruin credibility and your enjoyment of the picture as a whole . Characters are neither believable or worthy of your sympathy as they fire their guns at seemingly anything that moves . In the end , I just didn't care if they got off the island or not and by the time the end came , I was more relieved than entertained . Costumes are authentic enough until the cavemen arrive and it is bear-skin bikinis and loin cloths all round . And although it was fairly obvious from their actions , you wouldn't have known that some characters were German from their accents . The whole thing just lacked some polish and cohesion , leaving the viewer confused in places and nonplussed in others . Overall , this film barely registers a ripple of excitement these days although you can find some small amusement in trying to work out where Colin Farrell is . I spotted his name in the credits and half expected a baby to appear with an Irish accent and suspect facial hair . Oh well . Nothing particularly great here to see then , but just about OK if you 're eating your lunch and the weather is preventing further activity .  
1	  Hitokiri ( which translates roughly as " assassination " ) , a / k / a " Tenchu " which translates roughly as " divine punishment " ) showcases Hideo Gosha at the top of his form . Do NOT miss this one , or Gosha 's other classic , Goyokin ! Hitokiri is not only one of Gosha 's best films , it 's one of the best " samurai / chambara " films ever made , and perhaps one of the best Japanese films ever exported . Be warned , all of the intricate plot details in Hitokiri can be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with 19th century Japanese history . Even so , the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers . As per the norm for Gosha , Hitokiri provides yet another variation on his traditional theme of " loyalty to one 's lord " vs . " doing the right thing " . However , Gosha develops his favorite theme with such sophistication , that it 's really _ the _ movie to see ( along with Goyokin , of course ) . I suppose it breaks down like this : If you want a simpler , more action-oriented tale , you might want to see Goyokin . However , if you want a more thoughtful , multilayered ( albeit grim ) drama , see this one . ( OK , OK , essentially , the historical backdrop is a massive power grap between many different samurai clans who are either ( 1 ) working to reform , yet retain , the Tokugawa Shogunate , and ( 2 ) those who are trying to install the Emperor Meiji as the supreme ruler of Japan . Of course , those clans working " for " Emperor Meiji were often less interested in " reforming " Japan than in ensuring their own clan more power in the " new world order " . Ironically , the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one of the first reforms of the Meiji government . It 's ironic twists like this - Gosha 's big on irony - that make the entire plot all the more bittersweet . ) What distinguishes " Hitokiri " from Gosha 's other movies is Gosha 's mature sense of cinematography . Every shot is thoughtfully composed , and ( much like Kubrick 's Barry Lyndon ) each frame of the movie could hold its own as a still composition . Of course , this is typical Gosha . Hitokiri really stands out with stunning backdrops , including ( as with Goyokin ) many riveting seascapes . Just watch the opening sequence , and you 're hooked ! Make no mistake , this is no English period piece : Hitokiri is extremely violent ( don't say you weren't warned ) . What else , other than cool camera work , makes Hitokiri stand out ? The performances seem ( to me ) a bit more subtle in this one . Katsu Shintaro ( of Zatoichi / Hanzo the Razor fame ) turns in a star performance as the conflicted protagonist / antihero , Okada Izo . Katsu manages to instill humanity to a character that seems almost more wild animal than villain . Throughout the movie , you 're never quite sure if you 're engaged or revolted by Okada 's character . At the same time , Katsu 's portrayal of Okada 's ravenous hunger for respect , and his later pathetic attempts at redemption , seem so human that you can't help but feel empathy / sympathy . Of course , after seeing Nakadai Tatsuya play the tortured hero in " Goyokin " , it 's great to see him play such a ruthless villain in " Hitokiri " . He 's just perfect , there 's nothing more to say ! As a final note , perhaps more interesting to buffs than to casual fans , don't miss the last screen appearance of Mishima Yukio ( yes , the closeted gay right-wing ultranationalist novelist who committed suicide by seppuku before the crowd of jeering Japanese military personnel he " kidnapped " in 1970 , and had a movie on his life and work made by Paul Schrader ) , who actually does a pretty solid job of portraying the honorable ( for an assassin ) Shinbei Tanaka .  
0	  I had to endure teen-aged , high school angst and family conflict for almost all of the show . I really do not care about high-school girls fretting about their relationships . I 've spent my time in Hell dealing with such issues and I care nothing about fictional teenies going through " lite " versions of the horrors I endured . I want science fiction . That 's the only reason I 'm here . There were a few seconds of science fiction late in the show . We FINALLY see a proto-Cylon . It was good but with one problem . Its red eye-dot would lock onto an object of interest . We all know that Cylon eyedots always scan back and forth , giving the machine a map of the world . The red eye-dot does not ever stop moving back and forth . I really hope the writers fix this abuse before the second episode .  
1	  Storyline : Max von Sydow 's voice-over narration hypnotizes the protagonist ( and audience ) back to 1945 where our protagonist the young American ideologist Leopold Kessler ( Jean-Marc Barr ) has just arrived in post-WWII 1945 Germany to help rebuilding the damaged country . Uncle Kessler ( Ernst-Hugo Järegård ) supplies Leopold with a job in the big Zentropa train corporation , but soon Leopold falls in love with Katharina Hartmann ( Barbara Sukowa ) ; daughter of Zentropa owner Max Hartmann ( Jørgen Reenberg ) . Leopold soon finds himself caught in a web of corruption , being taken advantage of , losing his ideology , and is forced to chose between pest or colera . Mysterious , mesmerizing , manipulative , noirish , haunting , beautiful , and ugly . These are some immediate , grandiose , descriptions that come to mind when thinking of Lars von Trier 's 1991 masterpiece EUROPA ; the final chapter of the Europa trilogy . In USA it was retitled ZENTROPA so audiences wouldn't confuse it with Agnieszka Holland 's EUROPA EUROPA from 1990 ( equally a WWII drama ) . The Europa trilogy also consists of FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT from 1984 and EPIDEMIC from 1987 ( the infamous experiment that only sold 900 tickets in the Danish cinemas ) . The trilogy thematically deals with hypnotism and loss of idealism , although the themes of this trilogy are not as essential as the visuals . In the opening-shot of EUROPA we see a locomotive moving towards us while our unidentified narrator literally hypnotizes us : " On the mental count of ten , you will be in Europa . Be there at ten . I say : ten " . A metaphor for movies ' ability to transport us into a subconscious dream-reality . EUROPA utilizes a strange but extremely effective visual style - that famous Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky is Trier 's main-influence says it all . It 's a black-and-white movie occasionally intertwined with red in form of blood , a red dress etc . According to rumors this inspired Steven Spielberg to use the similar effect in SHINDLER 'S LIST from 1993 ( coincidentially another WWII drama ) . Furthermore Trier uses so-called Dutch angels and reinvents background-projection by adding separately shot co-operating layers upon layers , but unlike old Hollywood movies that incorporated it for economical reasons , Trier uses it for artistic reasons . These carefully executed strange-looking visual techniques underline that we are in a dream-reality , we are hypnotized ; the universe of EUROPA is not real ! EUROPA is often criticized for weighing advanced technique ( such as multi-layered background-projection ) above plot and characters , but hey that 's what reviewers criticized Stanley Kubrick 's 1968 visual masterpiece 2001 : A SPACE ODYSSEY for - nowadays it holds an obligatory place in all cinema-history books . EUROPA also gets accused of historical incorrectness . Apparently Trier assigns the Nazis ' Werewolf terrorist-group too much historical significance . According to various online-sources that 's correct ( a fascinating subject - try Googl'ing it yourself ! ) , yet Trier 's purposes are neither educational nor portraying history accurately . EUROPA is a never-ending nightmare . Leopold Kessler is hypnotized , therefore the universe that the audience encounters is a distorted reality . Equally it shows how our memory deceives us - a 100 % accurate reconstruction is a lie ! Although young audiences who experience EUROPA are too young to have memories from WWII , we have a collective memory of it from various BBC documentaries , so these small inaccuracies actually serve a purpose : they inform us us that we are not in post-WWII Germany 1945 , but in Leopolds memory of it . All three Europa trilogy chapters portray young ideologists with noble intentions forced into corruption and losing their ideological innocence . The ambiguous endings of FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT and EUROPA show the ideologists getting forever caught in their hypnotized realities . Before , during and after shooting EUROPA in 1990 in Poland , Lars von Trier and co-writer Niels Vørsel were extremely interested in WWII . It shows . It 's packed with extremely beautiful shots catching the atmosphere of the time-period spot-on . A great example is the old Polish church ( EUROPA was shot in Poland primarily for economic reasons ) in the last act of EUROPA . As with 2001 : SPACE ODYSSEY I think EUROPA will receive it 's rightfully deserved place in cinema-history . Its method of twisting old film-noir love-affair clichés and visual techniques is so unique , strange and completely different from anything you will see from Hollywood nowadays , or any other dream-factory for that matter . EUROPA is an essential movie in the Lars von Trier catalog . Some write it off as pure commercial speculation , but that would be catastrophic . It 's right up there with other Trier classics and semi-classics such as FORBRYDELSENS ELEMENT from 1984 , the TV-series RIGET from 1993 and DOGVILLE from 2003 . It 's a unique experience from before Trier cared for his actors , and before the Dogme95 Manifesto . Watch it ! " On the count of ten .. " 9/10  
0	  This film is terrible . You don't really need to read this review further . If you are planning on watching it , suffice to say - don't ( unless you are studying how not to make a good movie ) . The acting is horrendous .. serious amateur hour . Throughout the movie I thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like Michael Madsen , only to find out that it is actually him ! A new low even for him ! The plot is terrible . People who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before . Even by the standard of Hollywood action flicks , this is a terrible movie . Don't watch it ! Go for a jog instead - at least you won't feel like killing yourself .  
0	  I love Dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment ! I remember Lee from other Dracula films from when i was younger , and i thought he was great , but this movie was really bad . I don't know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing Lee was the ultimate Dracula , with style , looks , attraction and the evil underneath that . Or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me . But can you imagine Dracula with an snobbish English accent and the body language to go along with it ? Do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension .. ? Then this is a movie for you ! Otherwise - don't see it ! I only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie . Sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you . Maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home . Cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid , and i think that sums up the whole thing ! Or maybe you like this film because of it 's place in Dracula cinema history , perhaps being fascinated by how the Dracula story has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today . Cause as movie it isn't that appealing , it doesn't pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the Vampyre myth so fascinating . And furthermore it has so much of that tacky 70ies feel about it . The scenery looks like cheap Theatre . And i don't say that rejecting everything made in the 70ies . Cause i can love old film as well as new .  
0	  This movie was on t . v the other day , and I didn't enjoy it at all . The first George of the jungle was a good comedy , but the sequel .. completely awful . The new actor and actress to play the lead roles weren't good at all , they should of had the original actor ( Brendon Fraiser ) and original actress ( i forgot her name ) so this movie gets the 0 out of ten rating , not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy , this is a film that you turn to another channel or take it back to the shop if hired or bought . It was good to see Ape the ape back , but wasn't as fun as the first , they should of had the new George as Georges son grown up , and still had Bredon and ( whats her face ) in the film , that would 've been a bit better then it was .  
0	  It 's not really about gymnastics ; swap out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about archery , or microbiology , or a booger-flicking tournament . Instead , like every other Rocky / Flashdance derivative that flooded the 80s market , it 's about conquering adversity with stick to it iveness , rendering all social / personal realities irrelevant by your lonesome - with love interest standing by of course . Ronald Reagan top to bottom , in short ; so as a piece of cinema it 's down to the details . Some of the actors are quirky enough to liven things up - especially the love interest , brought to you by none other than Mr. Keanu Reeves , warming up for Ted ; heroine Olivia D'Abo 's hateful alkie dad and big-hair stepsister are more interesting than the sickly mom or her utterly inert bitch-nemeses / teammates , one of whom appears to be made of porcelain . It 's my instinct to be appalled by the comic-relief black guys , but on the other hand at least they 're in the movie . But D'Abo doesn't quite convince with her awkward-girl shtick , and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the gymnastics themselves really does matter ; it 's all just bodies hurtling around , and not only is the outcome of the big tournament a foregone conclusion , it 's all performed by an obvious double .  
0	  Well , no , not really . Its not really a good movie , but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be . I really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money , and sometimes thats all you can ask for . The plot is OK , nothing brilliant or new , the acting is pretty bad , but the cast is pretty . The directing is passable , but the effects are horrible , especially the werewolf effects , which in a werewolf movie , is a pretty big problem . There was a fairly decent amount of nudity , which to me is a pretty good thing , but it wasn't all that hot . All in all , its a fairly average direct to video movie , not the worst film I 've ever seen and if you 're bored a genre fan , check it out sometime . I 'd even watch it again . Bonus fact for horror geeks , Kane Hodder ( Jason Vorhees in a few of them ) plays the werewolf .  
1	  I love Monte Carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie . I thought everyone was very good . I was not familiar with Richard Lewis , I thought he made his character ( Julian Peters ) very personable , funny and attractive . Sean Young was very good as the befuddled rejected girl with a heart of gold . George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo . John Candy has a field day as the bon vivant . James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk . Cybill Shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife . Delightful ensemble cast . Lots of talent , clever script , lots going on and beautiful locations . Just a nice pick me up for a dreary day . Especially in the winter when a trip to Europe is not anywhere on your horizon .  
0	  The cast although nothing special , all do an OK job , the story seems like a good idea , the script is bearable and the end has quite a good twist ; so what 's wrong with it ? For a start the special effects are really bad ( if this was made in the 60 's ) it might look OK but in 2003 there is just no excuse for visuals as poor as this . It makes me laugh that the DVD cover claims very proudly ' from the special effects creator of Jeepers Creepers ' . Secondly the direction is weak , this film just does not capture the essence of the story , A doctor feeding the hospital inmates souls to the Devil ( or demon type creature ) should be tense or frightening ; it simply isn't . All in all this is a pretty poor film , and although bearable and at times mildly entertaining , it is still probably best left alone . A rather sad 4/10  
1	  This movie is just plain silly . Almost every scene has some bit of humor : running gags , slapstick , and great jokes . The acting isn't that great , and the plot is cliche , but the jokes more than make up for that . If you have a chance to see this movie , I recommend that you do .  
1	  I still liked it though . Warren Beatty is only fair as the comic book hero . What saves this movie is the set , the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script . I really expected something more substantial in the terms of action , or plot but I got very little . The main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in Hollywood at the time in such an unusual film . The one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was Madonna . She did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad . The movie at some points just stood still . You expected something more and you got nothing . Al Pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good . He and Beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy . It is also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman , and Warren Beatty in a film other than Isthar . I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things . The thing about this movie is it is good , but it could have been so much better . I liked it as a child because I thought it looked cool , and visually the movie is amazing , the sets are incredible , the writing is only fair , and with such a cast in the movie I would expect a little better anyway . SPOILER I especially thought the finale was not big enough . It was interesting but for such a grand scale film I just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang . The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere . The movie only uses the 7 comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway . The costumes and makeup were flawless as well . The facial makeup for the villains was great . Beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character . Still , this is a good movie that could have been much much more . It is to me better than Batman , the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time . Of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross .  
0	  First let me say that I am not a Dukes fan , but after this movie the series looked like Law and Order . The worst thing was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg . Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg , and even worse was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe , If they ever watched the show Roscoe was not a hard ass cop . He was more a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie . The movie is loaded with the usual errors , cars getting torn up , and continues like nothing happened . The worst example of this is when the the General gets together with Billy Prickett , and the General is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop , but goes on to win the race .  
0	  Never cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films ! Bob Fosse 's " Star 80 " about Dorothy Stratten , of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband , is a zillion times more interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen . Patty Hansen is no actress either .. I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a god-awful " poodlesque " hair-do .. Very disappointing .. " Paper Moon " and " The Last Picture Show " I could watch again and again . This clunker I could barely sit through once . This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms . Stratten 's tawdry death ; I think the real reason was because it was so bad !  
1	  SPOILERS THROUGH : I really am in the minority on this one but I liked this movie . It 's not a classic but it 's definitely involving and quite an adrenalin fueled ride . I definitely thought it was worth at least a 7 rating . Perhaps the reason I liked it is because I haven't seen the original . Something tells me that with a movie like this it 's strongest fans will be the people who have not seen the original version and thus , have little to compare it to . This was not a masterpiece but I did get into it quite a lot and it actually made me want to see the original . There were a few things I liked about it . One was the casting of Kowalkski . Viggo Mortenson was superb and really brought a lot of charisma to the role . Since the bulk of the movie fell on his shoulders , he really needed to be excellent and he was . This was a great role for him . Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that it 's made for television . I had no idea this was the case when watching it . It sure seemed like a major motion picture and I would never have guessed this was not a big screen release . I also found the story to be very absorbing . I 'm not one for action movies but I got sucked into this . Plus it was a lot more then an action movie in that there was drama , mysticism , a love story , quirky people every which way you turned . ( I didn't even recognize Priestly . ) And it was touching . This was not a great movie but it is watchable . And then there 's the ending . It packs a strong punch and if one 's been involved in the story up to that point , it 's very difficult not to be transfixed at the very end . I am not sure how I feel about the ending . The implication was that Kowalkski survived and though I 'm highly skeptical of HOW that would be possible , it is a movie and realism isn't an ingredient that 's always in the mix when making a movie . So I 'd have to say I found the end incredibly unrealistic but very touching in a manipulative kind of way , which I don't usually like but for some reason , is almost forgivable in this movie . Admittedly , a lot of things were just props for the plot ( could the villains have been anymore stereotypical ? ) But the makers got a lot right even if they got many things wrong as well . However , having said that , I will admit I can understand why someone who 's a major fan of the original would hate this version because , though I have not seen the original , I have seen many original movies I loved being remade with terrible results . ( My big dislike is actually sequels . ) But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high a quality . People have compared this to Smoky and the Bandit . How about a road version of " Legends Of The Fall " meets " Thelma and Louese " as well ? I sure felt touches of both films ( both of which I 'm a fan of . ) I do not think however , that this was a great film . It was better then average to me but far from great . But it was an absorbing , adrenalin fueled , touching movie with excellent casting of the main character . My vote is 7 of 10 .  
0	  Saw this piece of work at a film fest in CA . My god , what was the director thinking ? Film professors should use this film as a case study on what NOT to do when making a short film . First off , this project makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . The film takes place partially in " The Waystation " , some stupid vapid bar in the middle of nowhere , where nothing really takes place . THe acting is beyond bad . So bad in fact that I almost thought it was a comedy . The lead actress Julia Reading is a step below the acting in most amateur porn films . There is one or two decent performances , including the guys who played Jacob and Fenner but it 's like the director had no clue on how to work or use his thespians . The only thing worse than the acting was the dialogue , which bordered on absurd . The writer ( whom I assume is also the director ) writes each character like they are auditioning for a comic book villain . The overall production value is pretty good , but to be honest , with a film this bad it 's easy to overlook it . The production design is pretty good , although the Waystation looks like any ordinary bar . The costumes and make-up are okay , and I understand the production was working with a low budget . It 's just when the characters speak , or they try and push the plot forward , the film unravels into a muck of crap . As I 've said , this film is god awful . It 's like the director / writer watched a lot of sci-fi films and threw all the parts he liked into a blender and came up with this . My only hope is that he used other people 's money on this , because if he used his own , he 's a total sucker .  
1	  This movie is awesome on so many levels .. and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on . Just remember this : When you 're watching Shaun of the Dead and other recent zombie movies .. be they good or bad .. THIS is the formula that they are using . THIS is what makes zombie movies so great . And what makes it BETTER than great is the story behind the movie . A simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know . All in all , it doesn't linger . There 's never a point where you think to yourself " c'mon , get on with it " .. it moves quick and corners nicely . This is the sporty , little Italian number of zombie flicks . So awful , it 's wonderful ! If your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek .. rent it , buy it , love it . As a great trivia note : If you 're watching it on DVD , you 'll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen , underneath the musical score .. Well .. that 's because that music was lifted straight from the trailer .. which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop .  
1	  It was by accident that I was scanning the TV channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other . Ethan Hawke ( Jesse ) " Tape " ' 01 and Julie Delpy ( Celine ) " ER " 94 TV Series ( Nicole ) . This gal and guy , will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years . Jesse and Celine have great conversation , and deep eye contact with a great magnetic explosion between the two of them . I am looking forward to the SEQUEL to this film in 2004 and if you have viewed this film , you will feel the same way .  
0	  .. the first film I had to walk out on . And it was the cast and crew pre-screening ( Not that I was involved , I hasten to add ) . I made it through the first hour , so I reckon I 'm just qualified to comment , but that was my limit . Like other comments here , how did this get through any kind of QA . An accumulation of the very worst in dialogue , the epitome of wooden acting , awful casting , all wrapped together without a plot . Tara Fitzgerald 's casting was bizarre , almost comic . She possesses the worst Russian accent in movie history . As I left the screening , the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema . They obviously couldn't sit through it again either .  
1	  Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions , so I turned to my twin sister and said , " Hey this looks like fun , " - truly I love documentaries - so we started watching it . At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man , but then it was explained that due to his condition , he never went through puberty , thus the high voice and smaller body . He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause . He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality .. I cried , watched some more , laughed , got up to get another Kleenex , then cried some more . Once Jonni Kennedy 's " time was up " he flew to heaven to be with the angels . He was more than ready ; he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free . I highly recommend this . If you do not fall in love with this guy , you have no heart .  
1	  " The Case of the Scorpion 's Tail " has all the elements that are necessary in order to make an effective giallo movie . The story is standard giallo . When a man dies in a plane crash his wife ( Ida Galli ) collects a $ 1 million life insurance policy . The widow heads to Greece for the payout but a series of gruesome murders follow her . There are plenty of suspects , including a tenacious investigator ( George Hilton ) from the insurance agency and the widow 's lover . Director Martino keeps the story moving at a fast pace while the viewer tries to guess the identity of the killer . Anita Strindberg ( also memorable in " Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key " and " Who Saw Her Die ? " ) is a stunning-looking heroine . It 's one of Martino 's best films .  
1	  I used to watch Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10 . It was on right after Bay City Rollers . I saw it come on to Family Channel one day , and taped it for my then three-year old daughter . I 'd forgotten all the things I 'd loved as a child , the magic flute , the zoom broom , Witcheepoo 's makeup . This show is decidedly low tech . The mayor is surely a precedent to Mayor McCheese , and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes . But kids love this stuff . They would way , way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high-tech computer animation . There is ( mild ) slapstick , but no adult themes such as sex or people dying , and kids accept Jimmy 's schemes . Kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire , and I loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought Witchypoo was flying overhead . The music is old , but you really get used to it , and my daughter really loved it . She used to sing " different is hard , different is lonely " in the car . My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months , and it 's still one of her favourites . I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in the works . I really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don't do anything like computer-animating characters etc . I think a whole new generation would love Pufnstuf .  
1	  Like his elder brothers , Claude Sautet and Jean-Pierre Melville , Alain Corneau began to cut his teeth in French cinema with a series of fine thrillers : " la Menace " ( 1977 ) and " Série Noire " ( 1979 ) among others . " Police Python 357 " is a good example of how Corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career . They had a splendid cinematography , painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiency 's sake . The police superintendent Ferrot ( Yves Montand ) is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone . He makes the acquaintance of a young woman Sylvia Léopardi ( Stefania Sandrelli ) and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover : his superior Ganay ( François Périer ) . When the latter learns it , he kills her in a fit of anger . Ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him .. One could deem that this kind of far-fetched story isn't exempt from glitches and sometimes , one can see right through it but Corneau 's pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling , dusky atmosphere . The first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however , it is crucial for what will follow this key-moment . Corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary , minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation . In spite of drawbacks , Corneau and his scenarist Daniel Boulanger penned a deft story . Ménard ( Mathieu Carrière ) who sometimes expresses his surprise because Ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation . But his superior knows that he usually works alone . Actually , Ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself . Eventually , the chief idea of the film concerns Ferrot himself . He 's a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization . It is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses won't recognize him when he is brought face to face with them . The backdrop of this thriller , Orléans is efficiently enhanced by Corneau 's camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm .  
0	  Brides are dying at the altar and their corpses are vanishing . No one knows why or who , but an investigative reporter ( Luana Walters ) notes that each bride was wearing a strange orchid and she goes to interview its creator , Dr. Lorenz ( Bela Lugosi ) . Now Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits , including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife ( Elizabeth Russell ) with the fluid of young brides to keep her young . The Corpse Vanishes has an interesting premise and a short enough run time that it shouldn't be able to get boring . Unfortunately , while it starts off quite well , it does start to drag before the halfway point and gets rather boring with its clichés and predictable plot . There are some good things about it-Bela Lugosi is charming and evil and performs brilliantly ; Elizabeth Russell is also a beautiful , suave , aloof and very creepy countess ; and I 'm always a fan of Angelo Rossitto . Luana Walters is also convincing as the reporter here . It maintains a bit of a Gothic atmosphere and the sets are decent . But overall , it just didn't manage to hold my interest through the whole picture , and for that , I have to rate it poorly .  
0	  There are plenty of comments already posted saying exactly how I felt about this film so Ill keep it short . " The Grinch " I thought was marvellous - Jim Carrey is a truly talented , physical comedian as well as being a versatile clever actor ( in my opinion ) . Mike Myers on the other hand gets his laughs by being annoying . I used to like him very much in his " Waynes World " and " So I Married an Axe Murderer " days - but Ive never been fond of Austin Powers and " the Cat In The Hat " has just finished me off . This film was horrible - the gags were horrible ! inappropriate for children not only in adult content but in the fact that some of them were so dated they havent amused anyone for 50 years ! The plot was messy , messy , messy ! Its a shame really because the children were very likeable as was " Mom " . They probably could have picked a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could have pulled it off if it weren't for Myers ugly , revolting over-acted portrayal of the Cat . I mean - did Myers even glance at a script ? Was one written ? The other actors seemed to have one - but the Cat just seemed to be winging it ! On the other hand I would like to mention that the sets and props were marvellous ! But unfortunately they cant save this film . Poor Dr Seuss - the man was a genius ! Dont ruin his reputation by adapting his work in a such a lazy , messy way ! 1/10  
0	  I probably give this more credit than it deserves because it 's Halloween , I was just at " Knott 's Scary Farm " and I was in a mood to watch a really cheesy Halloween movie . Oh , and it only cost me one dollar . Usually I 'll ffwd through a movie like this to get to " the good stuff , " but I resisted the urge here and I 'm still not sure why . It was obvious from the opening shots this wasn't a " real " movie , not even a B-movie . It 's more in the category of the DeCoteau " horror " movies like " The Brotherhood " that are shot on film-look video for about 50 cents ( in fact , I was half afraid any minute one of his beefy college boys would stagger out rubbing himself in his underpants or something ) . There were no cutaway shots ( too expensive to do multiple camera setups ) and flat lighting but .. it 's hard to pinpoint . There 's something refreshing about watching a director with no money pull off a half-decent movie . The fact that he 's doing even a half-decent job is commendable , and this movie has it 's share of merits-the acting isn't bad , the photography is pretty good ( if too bright to be scary ) , there are some surprises , and the whole thing is sort of .. different somehow . A bunch of college kids are ( for some unknown reason ) stuck in the warehouse where they are decorating the annual haunted house . A creepy old man gives them a satanic book and they accidentally summon up the powers of hell . This results in the costumed people in the haunted house becoming who they are made up to be , and causing a lot of mayhem and human suffering . Along the way we are treated to an oddly complex and thoughtful lesbian relationship subplot-it 's interesting that this couple seems to be the most well-rounded in the movie . Yes , there 's a sex scene but it isn't salacious-or at least no more so than you 'd find in any legit movie about lesbians that shows them having sex . It 's rather unusual for a horror film to take the time and effort to do this without resorting to cheap exploitation . The other thing about this that held my interest was how it was clearly trying to emulate the " stupid kids have sex and get killed " vibe of the 80 's slashers . It 's hard to take that on because there are so many of those films that already exist , the genre has been done to death . I 'm not sure if it 's good or bad that these filmmakers simply tried to make another entry in that genre , without irony , as if it was still a LIVING genre , but I appreciated the attempt . Which is why I sat through it ; sometimes you just want to watch a mindless , no-budget , " A-for-effort " horror film . There really was too much set up , not enough gore , endless plot-holes , dead-ends and clichés and the unfortunate overall feel of a movie that simply did not have enough money behind it to be the film the producers envisioned .. but at the very least the haunted house scenes were pretty cool . I 'd pay to go to that haunted house if it existed , and didn't mind paying a dollar to see it on DVD even if I 'll never watch this again . Oh , and * possible spoiler * , but there was great , brief business with the vampire girl in the coffin : " I used to be claustrophobic . But I 've changed . " Ha ha , good one .  
0	  I was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a Bernard Malamud story . This is basically a story of possible redemption , racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust . A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife . If Morris Mishkin ( Zero Mostel ) will only believe in the angel ( Belafonte ) , his wife Fanny ( Ida Kaminska ) will recover . The problem is that Morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel . When he believes it , Fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly . It would have been very nice if there had been an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny speaks to Morris . Jan Kadar , who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in her Oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966 's " The Shop on Main Street " directs this film as well . Kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn't convey the desperate situation that she faces . She keeps calling for Ruthie , their daughter , who disobeyed them by marrying out of the Jewish religion . For most of the film , she does not realize the Angel 's appearance in her apartment . The scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the Angel 's girl friend confronts Belafonte in their apartment , is memorable but all too brief . We don't know why Belafonte is in danger and why he has died . Those viewing this film must have left the theater in a state of depression and desperation .  
1	  This is the one in which the diminutive Ruth Gordon plays an Agatha-Christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe . Gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of suffocation , while Gordon is traveling back and forth to New York . He manages , however , to leave behind some clues , scratches on a couple of black safe deposit boxes and an improvised and well-hidden note . Columbo enters the case , suspects her at once , and solves the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical intuitive powers . Oh , and Mariette Hartley is on hand as Gordon 's secretary and would-be blackmailer . Hartley is , I believe , the grand daughter of the psychologist B. F. Skinner . I 'm not sure her ancestry had anything to do with her attractive belly button , which is on display during a belly dance sequence , but I 've always admired Skinner anyway . The murder is well handled . It 's a good plot , and none of the performers or crew fluff anything . But the outstanding figure here is Ruth Gordon , only a skosh over five feet tall . She was over 80 years old and looked it . There are moments when she almost teeters , but she consistently exudes charm . Her acting is idiosyncratic . You can never be sure when she 's being serious or when she 's putting Columbo and the audience on . She 's given some good lines too . What humor there is comes from Gordon . Columbo doesn't have any of his frequent comic moments . All in all , a nice job by everyone concerned .  
1	  During the whole Pirates of The Caribbean Trilogy Craze Paramount Pictures really dropped the ball in restoring this Anthony Quinn directed Cecil B. DeMille supervised movie and getting it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras included . It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans , Louisiana which would have helped make The Crescent City once again famous for it 's Pirate Connections . When the Execs at Paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then I will be a happy camper . Paramount Pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now !  
1	  This was a good movie . It wasn't your typical war flick but something a bit different . This movie showed us recruits in training before the war and not actually fighting a war . This film is one of the more realist views on war and the army than most other films like this made . Colin Farrel did a great job at portraying an army recruit and Clifton Collins Jr and also Matthew Davis contributed reasonably well . Seeing Colin Farrel move from b grade to a grade in a few short years , You would never thought it would happen . I will also add that the makers of tigerland did a great job at filming a movie in the year 2000 and making it look like 1970 was a good touch . Its good to see talent used wisely and i hope to see this same talent again in the near future .  
1	  Robot Jox tries hard , but is fundamentally a series of fight scenes strung together - robot against robot , man against man , man against woman . The premise had potential , but it seems the script wasn't really given the couple of more drafts it needed . Still , it was fairly good , for a science fiction action movie . Part of it was because the script was by Joe Haldeman . For those who aren't familiar with the name , Haldeman wrote the award-winning science fiction novel " The Forever War . " It 's considered one of the very best powered battle armor novels , right up there with Robert Heinlein 's " Starship Troopers " and John Steakley 's " Armor . " And this movie is really more like a giant powered battle armor movie , rather than giant robots . It 's closer to what fans would have wanted instead of the travesty that was Paul Verhoeven 's " Starship Troopers , " which bore only a passing resemblance to the novel it was based on . Despite some assumptions , this really isn't based on Homer 's " Iliad . " A couple of names are all they had in common . Achilles having his robot 's foot blown off had no parallel in the Iliad , which didn't include Achilles ' death . Nor was the ancient Achilles a noble warrior . He was the mightiest , but also vengeful and petty . Even the robot jock killed off in the first scene doesn't fit . He was named Hercules , while the Greek Iliad would have had Herakles . The effects were fairly good for the time and the budget . True , it wasn't comparable to " Terminator 2 " a year later , but that movie cost ten times as much . The stop motion was almost as good as the robotic walkers in " The Empire Strikes Back " and " Return of the Jedi . " Better , in fact , than a lot of Ray Harryhausen animation , which is highly regarded , but quite dated . Don't bring high expectations into this and you probably won't be disappointed . It 's better than a lot of other low-budget flicks and even some big-budget blockbuster wannabes that have better effects but far worse scripts .  
1	  Otto Preminger 's noir classic works almost as a flip-side of LAURA .. while that film was glitzy and features the high fa-luting Clifton Webb , this film is a whole lot seamier . Dana Andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves . Preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked . Andrews is quite fine ( a lot less wooden than he 's been in the past ) and the stunningly beautiful Gene Tierney is stunningly beautiful ! Creepy Craig Stevens plays the unlucky victim . WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a must see and a terrific companion-piece to Preminger 's equally lurid WHIRLPOOL ( also starring Tierney ) .  
0	  This is the only movie I have ever seen that has prompted me to write a critique on any internet site , and that is a significant statement from someone who likes " The Attack of the Monolith Monsters . " This movie is perfect for anyone who wants an inoffensive movie . It is devoid of sex and violence , for example . I believe that this movie is safe for children of all ages . This movie is perfect for anyone who does not want to be entertained , challenged , or stimulated in any way . Adults could easily catch up on their sleep in front of the TV while the kids watch this movie . Don't be surprise , however , if you wakeup to find the kids have turned the TV off and started a board game . As an adult who enjoys being entertained , who enjoys everything from the mundane to the fantastic in realism , drama , comedy , and action , all of those adult things that reflect real life on earth and / or stimulate the imagination , this movie has nothing to offer .  
0	  This was not enjoyable to watch . Frank puts all his dreams on the back burner and gets a normal ( boring ! ) job just so his stepson can go to film school , but his stepson decides that he 'll make a humiliating documentary about the man instead . A documentary filmmaker should point the camera and simply shoot , not manipulate and comment with snide captions . The bitterness and resentment of the filmmaker towards his stepfather is obvious . And sad . The goal seems to be to make Frank appear dumb and pathetic , instead he comes across as the most human of the 3 people featured . Essentially a smear campaign all dressed up as something much smarter and edgier than it really is . It left me with an intense dislike for the filmmaker .  
1	  A fine story about following your dreams and actually taking a stab at Doing something about them when the chance strikes . Nothing was easy for Morris either-he had a family , job , job opps elsewheres , a mortgage , etc-it wasn't like he could just drop what he was doing and blithely hop on the greyhound to play AA ball for 4 months . It took guts . I am glad that they showed his indecision , almost up ' til he got the callup to the majors . I can remember seeing him pitch against the Red Sox ( I think .. ) , it was a great story . Though Morris actually looks more like John Kruk or a Mills Watson than Quaid-that 's okay . Quaid does a very good job playing the man , the teacher , coach and ' oldest rookie ' .. As someone who is in the the same age group , I certainly can ID with his plight . You 're not Quite too old to do what you had dreamed of as a kid , but it 's getting there . You have to do it sooner than lator . Believably told , nicely edited , paced , acted , good to see the familiar faces of the late Royce Applegate , Brian Cox and Rachel Griffiths here . Good job all around , glad to see it hit . * outta * .. who woulda thought that the Tampa Devil Rays woulda been the subject of such a good movie early on ?  
0	  The first few minutes of " The Bodyguard " do have a campy charm : it opens with crawling text from the Bible ( the part that Samuel Jackson recites to his soon-to-be victims in " Pulp Fiction " ) , continues with two karate school teachers in New York arguing about the eternal question of mankind ( who is better ? Sonny Chiba or Bruce Lee ? ) , and then Chiba appears , playing himself ; he immediately stops a plane hijacking and breaks a bottle in two with his bare hand . Unfortunately , any entertainment value , intentional or unintentional , soon gets crushed by the disjointed story , the lack of action for long periods of time , and the poor quality of any present action . To keep it simple , here 's why " The Bodyguard " is an unbearable movie to watch : 1 ) You don't know what 's going on . 2 ) There are barely any fights . 3 ) The fights that are there , are short and terribly filmed . Sonny Chiba is cool . Judy Lee is gorgeous , her face is glorious . It 's only for them that I give " The Bodyguard " a 2nd star out of 10 . This movie makes 87 minutes feel like 5 hours .  
1	  John Ford is one of the most influential and best remembered American filmmakers in the history of film , his name usually associated with the western film genre . However , John Ford 's arguably best film is not a western at all but a seedy drama set in the Irish fight for independence in the early 1920s : 1935 's The Informer . Times are tough on many in Ireland and the burnt out Gypo Nolan is caught in a web of poverty and desperation - and the walls are closing in . Gypo is big but he is not the brightest bulb on the tree , has a warm heart but a short fuse , and never seems to really think things all the way through but he is not a criminal or a self-centered pig . Walking the streets starving with no where to live , the hulking Gypo Nolan finds the prime lady in his life , Katie Madden , on the streets soliciting herself because of her own desperate situation and starts to dream about taking her to the United States if he only had the 20 Pounds to pay for it . As luck would have it , his friend Frankie is back in town with a 20 Pound price over his head and Gypo is desperate enough to inform the police of Frankie 's whereabouts . Gypo , with the new 20 Pounds of blood money earned , finds this foggy night particularly foggier as guilt swells all over him and the IRA invests all their resources to find Frankie 's informer . Victor McLaglen portrays the fallen Gypo Nolan and definitely deserved the Best Actor Oscar he was awarded for this film . His brutish , stupid , and tender turns give the character dimension and McLaglen is only second to Dudley Moore 's character Arthur Bach from the 1981 film Arthur as the most entertaining cinematic drunk . Margot Grahame 's performance as Katie Madden is also excellent but she and McLaglen are the only members of the cast who truly impress . Preston Foster is especially miscast as an IRA head , mainly because he is most obviously not Irish , and J. M. Kerrigan borders on irritating throughout his role in the film but this disappointing supporting cast is the film 's only poor point . Often overshadowed by some of Ford 's better known westerns like The Searchers or The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance , The Informer is easily one of John Ford 's best films - if not his very best . Beginning what would be a long career of Oscar nominations and wins for John Ford , The Informer won four Oscars including one for him for best director in 1936 . Ford and company 's use of shadows and light in the film is particularly engaging and vital to telling the story . Gypo 's walk through the streets is narrated by the gloomy state of the town and the glaring accusations of the street lamps , each shadow constantly reminding him of his dark deed . Ford 's command of this technique was amazing to watch ; if The Informer was made 10 years later ( thus making the genre requirements ) it would probably be considered one of the best films noir of all time but that does not hinder it from being remembered as an excellent classic film .  
0	  Maybe it was the title , or the trailer ( certainly not the interview on the DVD , which is with the director as he keeps saying " hi , kids " into the camera like a buffoon ) , but I had expectations for Entrails of a Virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal , bloody killings by a weird Japanese penetrator . Turns out it 's way too sleazy for its own good , or bad , or whatever . There 's a problem - and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust , similar to this in many respects - in not having balance to the sex and violence . Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno , and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies ! And with the killing scenes , there has to be at least a little tack , and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity , in creating the creature / killer / whatever . Entrails of a Virgin has neither . It 's safe to say it 's a pretty soulless movie , even if isn't one of the very worst ever made - it 's there just for horn-dog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their ' other ' heads . In this case , we 're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls , nothing too salacious , and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by " A Murderer " as he 's credited . First off , the director Kazuo ' Gaira ' Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on - we get spliced in ( or phoned in , take your pick ) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere . It looks like it 's from another movie . Then once settled into the house , there 's a ' wrestling ' scene that 's poorly choreographed and shot ( yeah , we really need to see him ' all ' there ) , and then on to the rape and killings . First the rape , by the photographers , who promise the girls some jobs for their time . Then the Murderer , who like D'Amato 's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial , and who for an unknown reason kills the men and / or rapes the women one by one . Now , the latter of those , taken by themselves , should be considered the highlights of the movie . This is like saying , however , that the croûtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad . An eye-gouging scene , a spike thrown like an Olympic event ( that scene , actually , is kind of cool ) , and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl , whose inconsequential name I can't remember . Even * this * becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title ! On top of this , the sex scenes , which become tedious through ' Gaira ' and his indulgence in long takes without cutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway , are dubbed over by the actors ( you 'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough , hence the need to let them ' speak ' for themselves ) . But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one , where it 's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror ( watch as the last girl left alive , the virgin of the picture , tries to stop the murderer from getting to her , which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him ! ) You just want it to be done with , for the ' I hate women ' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether .  
1	  and possibly closest to the Dickens story line . Although I find the young Ebenezer hard to watch ( who 's idea was that period hair , surely they could have done better than that ! ) , Scott does an incredible job as Scrooge . His delivery of some of the lines from Dickens finally brought it to life for me . Edward Woodward is everything we expect and more of the Ghost of Christmas present . I find G.C. Scott 's Scrooge much more of a believable miser than the more current version done by Patrick Stewart . The scene Christmas Morning when Scrooge realizes he hasn't ' missed it ' , is enough to convince one that Scott knows how to act versus overact . He 's phenomenal here . Nearly the entire cast is incredible . The Tiny Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol is a little tough to look at , almost too sweet . Still the music and the scenery make this a must watch every holiday . Enjoy !  
0	  This is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage , that no doubt wants to be a Friday the 13th ( 1980 ) clone . The poster for this movie makes it look like there 's going to be some sort of a cross between Jason and Freddy , which is likely to attract movie-goers . There is NOTHING good or entertaining about this movie about this movie . It just makes me sad , just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon Sleepaway Camp II : Unhappy Campers ( 1988 ) on video or DVD , and waste their time with this sad , cynical , depressing movie . Angela Baker ( Pamela Springsteen ) is a camp counselor at Camp Rolling Hills , who hopes that the other campers are as nice as she is , and that they stay out of trouble . Meanwhile , the other campers are realizing that people are disappearing one by one , with Angela making up the excuse that she had to send them home . Could Angela be the killer , who was once a man , who underwent a sex change operation years earlier ? Who knows ? Who cares ? The 1980s was home to a lot of movies that made the cross between the Mad Slasher and Dead Teenager genres , in which a mad killer goes berserk . Some have a plot , some don't , but they 're all about as bad as this one . Sleepaway Camp II : Unhappy Campers is 80 minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed , strangled , impaled , chopped up , burned alive , and mutilated . That 's all this movie is . It is just mindless , bloody violence . Watching this movie , I was reminded of the Friday the 13th movies , in which the message for its viewers was that the primary function of teenagers is to be hacked to death . The filmmakers of Sleepaway Camp II have every right to be ashamed of themselves . Imagine the sick message that this movie offers for its teen viewers : " The world is a totally evil place , " this movie tells you , " and it 'll kill you . It doesn't matter what your dreams or your hopes are . It doesn't matter if you have a new boyfriend , or a new girlfriend . It doesn't matter what you think , what you do or what your plans for the future are . You can forget those plans , because you 're just going to wind up dead . " And the sickest thing is-and by not giving too much away-the movie simply sets up room for a sequel . Well , why not ? They 've probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movies . I missed out on the original Sleepaway Camp ( 1983 ) , and , after watching its first sequel , I will hopefully stay away from the other sequels , as well as the original . And for parents , if you know kids who actually LIKE this movie , do not let them date your children .  
1	  This movie is still an all time favorite . Only a pretentious , humorless moron would not enjoy this wonderful film . This movie feels like a slice of warm apple pie topped with french vanilla ice cream ! I think this is Cher 's best work ever and her most believable performance . Cher has always been blessed with charisma , good looks , and an enviably thin figure . Whether you like her singing or not - who else sounds like Cher ? Cher has definitely made her mark in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others have come and gone . She is one of the most unique artists out there . It 's funny , because who would have thought of Cher as such a naturally gifted actress ? She is heads above the so-called movie " stars " of today . Cher is a real actor on the same level as Debra Winger , Alfre Woodard , Holly Hunter , Angela Bassett and a few others , in that she never seems to be " acting , " she really becomes the character convincingly . She has more than earned the respect of her peers and of the movie-going public . Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful - the characters , the scenery , the dialog , the food . I never get tired of watching this movie . Every time single time I watch the scene where they are all sitting around the dinner table at Rose 's house , I pause the remote to see exactly what delicious food Rose is serving . I saw the spaghetti , mushrooms ( I think ) , but I can't make out whether they are eating ravioli , ziti ? What is that main course ? It looks wonderful and its driving me nuts ! Everybody in that family was a hardworking individual and they respected and cared about one another . The grandfather wasn't pushed aside and tolerated , he was a vital part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom . He seemed to be a pretty healthy , independent old codger too . Loretta 's mom wasn't " just a housewife , " she was the glue that held the family together and was a model example of what a wife , mother , and home manager should aspire to be . She was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen but she didn't let it define who she was . High powered businessmen aren't as comfortable in their skin as Rose Casterini was . Notice the saucy way she said " I didn't have kids until after I was 37 . It ain't over ' til its over . " You got the sense that she had been the type of young woman who did exactly as she pleased and got her way without the other person realizing what had happened . She was charming , quick witted , and very smart . What a great mom ! I didn't actually like Loretta right away because she seemed like a bit of a know-it-all who wasn't really as adventurous and as in control of herself as she wanted others to think . She could tell others about themselves and where they had gone wrong , but she really didn't apply common sense to her own life . She was going to marry a middle-aged mama 's boy simply because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose to her life . She was more conventional than her own mom . She dressed and wore her hair like a matron at a house of detention and seemed humorless and bored , but underneath you sensed that she was vulnerable and lonely and had a lot of love to give the right man . She would probably end up making an awesome mom too . I could see in the future , a house full of Loretta and Ronnie 's loud , screaming happy kids and Rose and Cosmo enjoying every minute of it .  
1	  This is a film exploring the female sexuality in a way not so often used . Almost every other film with this kind of sexual scenes always becomes rated X , and so seen as a pornographic movie . Here is a kind of romantic horror story combined with the females " own satisfaction " need . A very good film !  
1	  This was basically an attempt to do the same thing with " Batman " that was done with " Gilligan 's Island " in " Surviving Gilligan 's Island . " For those of you who missed it ( and shame ! ) " Surviving Gilligan 's Island " ( full title : " Surviving Gilligan 's Island : The Incredibly True Story of the Longest Three Hour Tour in History " ) was a special from a few years back , where Bob Denver ( " Gilligan " ) , Dawn Wells ( " Mary Ann " ) and Russell Johnson ( " The Professor " ) related the story of the show 's creation , cancellation , rediscovery & rebirth . Along the way , stories were dramatized with actors portraying the original cast and crew . It was very well done . It was funny , well cast and came across as a genuine document of the show . " Return to the Batcave : The Misadventures of Adam and Burt " is in a similar style . The re-telling of the history of the show , the re-enactments , the general feel are all the same . What 's missing is the straightforward approach that " Surviving " took . In " Return " , Adam West and Burt Ward both receive invitations to a car show to which they were not meant to be invited . After being allowed to stay , Adam and Burt witness the theft of the centerpiece of the show : the legendary Batmobile ! Adam and Burt decide to chase after it themselves , leading them through clues that cause them to think about the history of the show . This eventually leads to the revelation of who stole the Batmobile and why . Choosing to use this conceit ( actually having a plot ) is the biggest letdown of this show . Unlike " Surviving " , " Return " forces the viewer to follow a less interesting storyline ( the theft of the Batmobile ) instead of focusing all its attention on what the audience would most be interested in ( the history of the show . ) It is the historical sections that work the best . The casting ( as in " Surviving " ) is excellent . Jack Brewer ( " Adam West " ) and Jason Marsden ( " Burt Ward " ) capture the feel of the actors without looking * too * much like them . Brett Rickaby ( " Frank Gorshin " ) bears a stronger resemblance to his subject , but captures none of the late Gorshin 's charm , only his characterizations . Other actors ' portrayals are short and functional , with none standing out as especially good or bad . Many of the stories have been told before , but they mostly play out amusingly , with only the occasional clunky presentation . Another wonderful bit from the historical sections was the use of audition footage of Lyle Waggoner 's tryout for the part of Batman . The only place where the flashbacks fail is when they insert obviously made up plot points to advance the main story . This downgrades the accuracy of the flashbacks needlessly . The " main plot " ( if that is what we must call it ) is , of course , ludicrous . This is not really a fault in and of itself , but it 's just not carried off well enough to cover up the shortfall . Strong performances and good writing can make up for a silly plot ( especially in these kinds of things ) but we really get neither , here . The performances by West and Ward seem somewhat flat ( even for them ) ; the dialog too carefully written for it to feel natural . Again , I think the comparison to " Surviving Gilligan 's Island " can be seen in that the dialog is mostly just there to set up a flashback . In " Surviving " , that 's all it intends to be . In " Return " it tries to do double duty and , unfortunately , often fails . Gorshin and Newmar do well ( although I agree with others that Gorshin had not aged well and that Newmar had - and what 's Waggoner taking to look that good ? ) but aren't given enough to do . Again , I think they all would have been better served by a more straightforward presentation than the one chosen here . Another odd point about " Return " . This special is about the " Batman " TV series and its history , yet all the clips shown are from the theatrical movie . Even the Waggoner footage is technically movie footage . If you know you 're " Bat-history " , then you know that the movie was originally planned to be made first , only to be delayed in favor of the TV show when CBS needed to fill time fast . So when Waggoner and West were testing for the role , it was for the movie , not the TV show . Why " Return " only uses movie footage is unclear . It most probably has to do with rights issues , but it is a distinct distraction to those in the know : seeing Julie Newmar in the present , but only footage of Lee Meriwether as Catwoman in the past . Overall , I liked the show , mainly for the flashbacks . I would have preferred the style used in " Surviving Gilligan 's Island " , but I can understand why they 'd want a more story-oriented piece given the subject matter . Besides , I like these people . It 's nice to see them out and about , still having fun with one of the great pieces of entertainment history . I just wish they had done it a little better and when more of the original cast was still alive to be there .  
1	  I cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is . Suffice it to say , anytime I 'm depressed about how unfair or futile things seem , this is the movie I go rent to put me in the right frame of mind . The background music makes you realize the easiness of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness . The Indian girl that sings is but one example of a character in this film who does not try hard , and is happy as a result . Persifina , the laundry co-worker of Ruby 's ( Ashley Judd ) is another = - her eyes and smile could make the hardest person 's day . I watch this movie and I dream of better days to come or of a good conversation with friends , and I realize that being alone-Ruby is alone quite often-isn't the same as being lonely . Recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful lull of a movie .  
0	  While watching the film , I 'm not sure what direstion it was to take . There 's a reason a writer shouldn't direct his work and even act in it as well , you can't do it all . I felt the story really suffered in this film due to the director wearing so many hats . Ms . McTeer is the film . To add to her amazing talents , her portrayal of this woman was why I was engaged . Here is a British actress who can do anything . In my view , conflict is what makes drama and a great story . I felt this film didn't have that . Everything was somewhat easy for the characters , there were no real obstacles preventing the chahracters from getting what they wanted . Watch the film for the sweetness , but most of all for Ms . McTeer 's brilliant performance .  
1	  when i first started watching these it became one of my favourite shows . Melissa Joan hart is very funny and talented so were the aunts and the other characters and the star of of the show Salem the cat , he was immensely funny . the first few season in my opinion were the best where Sabrina was a teenager in high school adapting to witch life . they were most funniest , most entertaining and most um .. good . i 'm not a fan of when they started introducing Brad and Dreamer cause i quite liked Valerie , but they were okay the problem was they were only in it for one season . if you 're gonna have new people at least keep them . i didn't like Josh he was a tw * t , i preferred Harvey but then he disappeared . and they got rid of Libby ! it would have been awesome if thy had been bickering in theses seven years . and Mr. craft as well , if him and Zelda got married that would have been gold ! then Sabrina moves out of her aunts house and into Roxie / Miles / Morgan 's house . i didn't like theses people either , it didn't really seem they liked Sabrina . Sabrina seemed to lose her charm and stuff and the aunts seem to be shunned out of her life and into they 're own stupid story lines . i kind of stopped watching it for a while and the old re-runs were back and i was like whoo-hoo ! LOL . i must say the last few seasons were absolutely terrible . they got rid of the aunts which sucked cause they were a big part of the show . then suddenly she lets those two freeloaders move in to the nice house when they treated he like dirt . and now she 's working at some magazine shop so they 're putting loads celebrity guest stars into the show , if they 're in every episode it kind of ruins it . the programme just really went downhill and lost its luster . i saw the last episode . it had the aunts in it ( Zelda was reduced to a candle ) and she 's about to get married but she runs off with Harvey the end . i would have liked to know what happened after . well thats my review and the only thing i can say is the only thing that stayed it 's appealing self through the seven years was Salem the cat .  
1	  I remember this show from Swedish television . I was only 7 years of age and it scared me beyond belief . I would love to revisit this series and see if it was just as excellent as remember though i suspect my taste and demands have changed . Although this was released before alien and a plethora of other space-thrillers i suspect that it has its root in scary movies from the 50 : s and the political climate of the 70 : s . When i think of it , this was a real sci-fi , a movie trying to discuss scientific and political questions about who we are and what we are . The term sci-fi has since then become bleak and come to be the term for any movie that has space-ships in them .  
0	  I saw this film opening weekend in Australia , anticipating with an excellent cast of Ledger , Edgerton , Bloom , Watts and Rush that the definitive story of Ned Kelly would unfold before me . Unfortunately , despite an outstanding performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role , the plot was paper thin .. which doesn't inspire me to read " Our Sunshine " . There were some other plus points , the support acting from Edgerton in particular , assured direction from Jordan ( confirming his talent on show in Buffalo Soldiers as well ) , and production design that gave a real feel of harshness to the Australian bush , much as the Irish immigrants of the early 19th century must have seen it . But I can't help feeling that another opportunity has been missed to tell the real story of an Australian folk hero ( or was he ? ) .. in what I suspect is a concession to Hollywood and selling the picture in the US . Oh well , at least Jordan and the producers didn't agree to lose the beards just to please Universal .. Guess I will just have to content myself with Peter Carey 's excellent " Secret History of the Kelly Gang " . 4/10  
1	  I saw this movie the day it came out last year . Hilarious I thought . Well , now it 's on video and I saw it again . I love this movie ! The things they do are sometimes dumb but that 's what makes it my third favorite movie of all time . The special effects are okay , but the witty dialog will have you rolling . I 'm the kind of person that 'll say i 'm inspired by this movie , so if you like dramas and other stuff , avoid . But for all others , enjoy ! The acting is superb . Hank Azaria is hands down the best ( he 's neither a commie , nor a fruit ) followed by Ben Stiller ( uh , don't correct me . it sickens me ) and then William H. Macy delivering his best performance ( outshining fargo ) Everybody has praised everyone from macy to garafalo , but I think Kel Mitchell was pretty good as Invisible Boy . Two problems : The most boring part of the film is the subplot of the romance between Stiller and Claire Forlani , and the Casanova parole hearing . Some scenes absolutely advance the story in no way , but they 're a blast . Kinka and especially the writers tend to drag on a scene untill all it 's hilarity is gone , but bam they switch and you 're ready for more . I swear after seeing this , you will be tired from the explosive climax ( which I think was pretty cool ) The camera is pretty cool also , moving at a furious pace with the actors . Also , Tom Waits delivers an outstanding performance ( he has this kinda cool bad hero coolness to him ) and like someone else said , the best parts are when the characters show some humanness to them . Captain Amazing is pretty funny , ( especially his speech to Casanova about his perfect plan-I was rolling ) and rush is pretty cool as Casanova . One beef : the funniest comedian ever ( eddie izzard ) is almost wasted , but his heart is in the right place . So all in all , a wonderful movie . I give it twenty stars and hope that someday , everyone will see the brilliance in the film 's best parody , the Six Million Dollar Man one . Laughing right now as I think about it . 20/10  
0	  WARNING ! Don't even consider watching this film in any form . It 's not even worth downloading from the internet . Every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid . The so-called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film . They couldn't tell a good joke to save their lives . It 's an insult to any human being . If you 're looking for a fun-filled movie - go look somewhere else . Let 's hope this Mr. Unterwaldt ( the " Jr. " being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy ) dies a slow / painful death and NEVER makes a film again . In fact , it 's even a waste of time to WRITE ANYTHING about this crap , that 's why I 'll stop right now and rather watch a good film .  
1	  " Der Todesking " - Jorg Buttgereit 's second full-length feature film ( the first one was notorious " Nekromantik " ) has no central character or characters , but instead thematic continuity in the act of suicide . Divided into days of the week , it comprises of a series of set-pieces , each of which featuring the self-destruction of a complete stranger . Yes , the production values are low and it 's disturbing , but in many ways " Der Todesking " is extremely effective . It makes you think which is sometimes more important than pure entertainment . Unlike the other Buttgereit 's works it isn't very gory , but there are some unpleasant images like castration scene in the Tuesday episode , a decomposing corpse and various acts of suicide . The last ( Sunday ) episode is so depressing and full of pain ! - just amazing if you want my opinion . 10 out of 10-check out this post-modernism shocker ! Disturbing art in the purest form !  
0	  Ice-T stars as Mason a homeless African-American who finds himself hunted by wealthy hunters ( Rutger Hauer , Gary Busey , Charles S. Dutton , F.Murray Abraham , William McNamara and John C. McGinley ) however Mason proves to be much harder prey then the usual targets in this ridiculous and slow paced actioner which takes too long setting up actionscenes and then totally botching them .  
0	  The John Goodman program was pretty awful , but this thing just plain stinks . The one and only thing in this mess that made me smile was recognizing the voice of Patrick Starfish as Frosty . The story is hopeless , written by somebody who has garbled memories of childhood rebelliousness but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years . Paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit . Everybody is unpleasant , and for no reason . The plot is predictable but the show lurches from one inexplicable , unconnected scene to another in such a pointless way there is no fun in watching it . The worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have ever seen snow !  
1	  The vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences , inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift , sure justice ; good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts . It is , in fact , one of the things that has made the character of Dirty Harry Callahan ( as played by Clint Eastwood ) so popular . He carries a badge and works within the law , but at heart , Harry is a vigilante , meting out justice ` his ' way , which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors , as well as the criminals he 's pursuing . But it 's what draws the audience ; anyone who 's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another , delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it - even if it 's only on the screen . And that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done - and quickly - is one of the elements that makes ` Sudden Impact , ' directed by and starring Eastwood , so successful . In this one , the fourth of the series , while working a homicide , Harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work - an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own , with one exception : Whoever it is , he 's definitely not carrying a badge . In his own inimitable way , Inspector Callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time . So he does ; as only ` Dirty Harry ' can . In a small town north of San Francisco , Harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case , which he quickly links to a recent murder in San Francisco because of the unique M.O. employed by the perpetrator . Unaccountably , Harry encounters resistance from the local Police Chief , Jannings ( Pat Hingle ) , who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere . Not one to be deterred , however , Harry continues his investigation , which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist , Jennifer Spencer ( Sondra Locke ) . Gradually , Harry discovers a link between the victims ; the burning question , though , is where does Jennifer Spencer fit into the picture ? Eastwood is in top form here , both in front of and behind the camera , and it is arguably the second best of the five-film series , right behind the original ` Dirty Harry . ' It had been seven years since the last ` Harry ' offering ( ` The Enforcer , ' 1976 ) , but Eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor . And this one definitely benefits from having him in the director 's chair , as he is able to recapture the essence of , not only his own character , but that ` spirit ' that made these films so successful , and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between # s 3 and 4 . As with all the films he directs , Eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end . The screenplay , by Joseph Stinson , is well written and formulated to that distinctive ` Dirty Harry ' style ; the dialogue is snappy and the story itself ( conceived by Charles B. Pierce and Earl E. Smith ) is the most engaging since the original ` Dirty Harry , ' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama , rather than entirely upon the action . The characters are well drawn and convincing , and , of course , this is the film that gave us one of Harry 's best catch-phrases : ` Go , ahead - make my day .. ' As Harry , Clint Eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular : He lives by a personal moral code , a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made America what it is today . Harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear , possibly more so today than ever before . No matter who we are or where we come from , there 's undeniably a part of us that wants to be Harry , or at least have him around . ` Dirty Harry ' is an icon of the cinema , and it 's impossible to envision anyone but Eastwood portraying him ; for better or worse , Eastwood ` is ' Dirty Harry , without question , just as Sean Connery is James Bond and Basil Rathbone , Sherlock Holmes . Sondra Locke is entirely effective here in the role of Jennifer Spencer , a young woman wronged and out for vengeance , or as she sees it , ` justice . ' She manages to bring a hard-edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character , with a convincing , introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the ` action ' genre . Even amid the violence , Locke keeps her focus on Jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life . Her portrayal makes a perfect complement to Eastwood 's Harry , and becomes , in philosophy and deed , something of his counterpart . In supporting roles , two performances stand out : Paul Drake , as Mick , creates the best ` psycho ' since Andy Robinson 's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original ` Dirty Harry . ' With actually very limited screen time , Drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing , which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience . This is the guy you can't wait to see Harry take care of in the end . Also effective is Audrie J. Neenan , who makes her character , Ray Parkins , the epitome of the proverbial ` low life , ' who can be found in any bar in any city . It 's a performance that evokes a gut-level response , and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film , in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism . The supporting cast includes Albert Popwell ( Horace ) , Mark Kevloun ( Bennett ) and Nancy Parsons ( Mrs. Kruger ) . With a perfect blend of drama and action , ` Sudden Impact ' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality ; the perfect justice of a not-so-perfect world , that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience . 9/10 .  
1	  When you read the summary of this film , you might come to think that this is something of an odd film and in some ways it is , for the primary character of this film , Gerard Reve ( Jeroen Krabbé ) is haunted by visions and hallucinations . The visions Gerard see are all ( more or less ) subtle hints to what will happen to him as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try and figure out the symbolism used in the film . Despite the use of symbolism and a couple of hints to the ending of the film , the film maintains a very high level of excitement throughout and does not get boring for one minute . This is mostly due to the great performances of Jeroen Krabbé and Renée Soutendijk ( Christine ) and the great direction of the whole by Paul Verhoeven . His directing style is clearly visible and one can say , looking at it from different angles , that ' De Vierde Man ' is a typical Verhoeven film . It will not only seem typical for people familiar with his American films because of the nudity and the graphic violent scenes , but it will also seem typical for people familiar with his Dutch films , because of the same things and his talent to tell a great story . When people watch Verhoevens American films , short sighted people might say , he has no talent in telling a good story and only focuses on blood and sex . That is what some people think , whereas I think that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each with each film . Although not a good film , Hollow Man ( his last American film ) is an example that Verhoeven can do more than science fiction splatter movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more various films to helm . He needs that . Just watch his Dutch films . Not only do they show that he needs a certain amount of freedom , but they also show that he has remarkable talent . ' De Vierde Man ' brought him one step closer to Hollywood and is certainly one of his best . 8 out of 10  
0	  The original was a good movie . I bought it on tape and have watched it several times . And though I know that sequels are not usually as good as the original I certainly wasn't expecting such a bomb . The romance was flat , the sight gags old , the spoken humor just wasn't . This may not have been the worst movie I 've ever seen but it comes close .  
0	  Hmm , Hip Hop music to a period western . Modern phrases like " cool " and too many others to keep track of . " The sistahs are in tha house " ! ? French manicured nails on hard riding girls . Microphone packs CLEARLY visible on Li'l Kim 's back . I just can't go on with the litany of errors made by the director and editors . The acting isn't as bad as I 've ever seen . The women did well enough with a poor script . It was weird hearing Louis Mandylor speaking in his native accent . The girls are beautiful . The costumes fabulous albeit completely incorrect . I just can't believe they would dumb down what could have been a great story . I would feel offended to believe that this movie was loaded with such trappings that it would play well in the inner city .  
0	  Okay I had heard little about this film , so when it came on the movie channels on TV , I wanted to watch it , being a horror aficionado . I think I can do a collective " huh ? " for everyone who watched it . I decided to move on with my life , but at a party with my closest friends , we saw it was coming on and some of us having seen it already decided we could laugh our way through it , both of us proclaiming " this is the dumbest thing I 've ever seen " . It wasn't scary ; Ill give it to Roth ( who I think is a young hack ) ; characters do change throughout the film , ala " Cube " . HOWEVER despite your typical " rats in a cage " scenario - who will turn on who , etc . , it was pretty average horror . A few points : 1 . ) What was with that kid ? I 'm not even talking about him being weird and biting people . I 'm talking about the whole " slow motion karate kicking " , what was that ? 2 . ) Okay I know Rider 's character liked Jordan Ladd 's , but as a young woman , I was appalled that he just went ahead and molested her in her sleep . Uh , thats illegal . 3 . ) Roth was in the movie just so Roth could be in the movie . Talk about pointlessly writing yourself in ! 4 . ) What was with the deputy ? 5 . ) So she was just instantly pulled apart by the dog ? And there was little to no blood left ? Just a scrap of her jeans ? Anyway we were LAUGHING our asses off , and I love laughing during horror movies ( Return of the Living Dead 2 , Evil Dead ) , but I don't know if we were supposed to be laughing here ..  
0	  According to reviewers , the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school . Jolly joke ! 1955 ? The synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet , but there it is on the bandstand . The Ford Pony Car was not invented yet , but there it is playing oldies music . The synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970 's . The Pony Car at best is from the mid 1960 's . 20 year-old college kids ? Josh Brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made-for-TV movie was produced . The plot is so predictable that viewers have plenty of spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their TV 's .  
0	  This is the worst piece of crap I have seen recently . There is nothing good about this movie . The plot is plain stupid , dialogs don't make any sense , humorous scenes never heard anything about the real humor . Actors just don't play , the worse they don't even try . The script itself is somewhat which is in the same league with Ed Wood and Uwe Boll . There is only one good thing in this flick , the fights . They are well choreographed as one would expect of the Hong Kong guys , and are the only reason to watch Prince of the Sun . Although I believe the fights are just supposed to fill the empty space so that the screenwriter didn't have to bother thinking about the storyline . However , this weak and absurd plot may prevent you from watching it to the end . Avoid it unless you are fan of the dragon lady Cynthia Rothrock .  
0	  You know Jason , you know Freddy , and you know Leatherface . Now , get ready for : The Safety Pin Killer ! That 's right , in Killer Workout , a dumb slasher movie if I 've ever seen one , the unseen murderer dispatches his ( or her ? ) victims with an oversized , novelty safety pin . It is an odd choice to be sure , the kind of thing that deserves an explanation . Naturally , the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing . As the title suggests , an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect . In fact , the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer , just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed . And since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead , it 's really just process of elimination . Oddly , while the entire name cast is killed off , the aerobics classes continue in earnest . In fact , nothing is capable of stopping the dancing . While three men are murdered in the next room , the workout goes on . Death isn't even a factor ; one character dies , but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions . Director David Prior knew what he was doing when named the movie Killer Workout and not Logical Workout . Cop chases , explosive tanning beds , and hundreds of shots of women 's exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure . Much like the woman caught in the tanning bed , I felt very uncomfortable by the end of Killer Workout . Finally , thankfully , THE END flashed on the screen . What happened next ? You got it , shots of the women working out . Not even the end of the movie can stop them !  
1	  I saw the film for the first time at BBC on July the 27 of 2005 . For me it was a good interpretation of the person Conan Doyle , and I truly wonder what the sherlock fans think about it . I also think it is a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what is mentioned . You may ask yourself was A.C. Doyle a strong person or did he put himself in question . However he was the creator of the famous Holmes , but how much of it was a sort of semi-biography ? Not the less I strongly put this adaption forward , it is a movie you have to see - even if you aren't interested in the Sherlock Holmes movies or books - look a it , enjoy yourself and have your own opinion of it .  
1	  I just saw this film last night at Toronto Film Festival where it was playing under the Midnight Madness section . To tell you the truth , the only reason why I went for this movie was because it shared its name with the Radiohead song , and also because my friend had bought the tickets so I really didn't have a choice :-D I went in expecting it to be something like The Silence of the Lambs , but it turned out to be semi-gore flick . Somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable , and that is absolutely correct . I really couldn't care less if Potente 's character got her entrails ripped out by the Creep . I was rooting for the homeless to make it out alive with Potente 's character getting her just desserts . Christopher Smith has certainly done a great job with the visual aspect of the film . However , the story is rather weak , but then again the whole point of the movie was to scare the crap out of you and it did that quite effectively . The score by a Bristol band called The Insects was top notch . That , more than anything else , really scared the crap out of me . The director was a really decent chap and was quite entertaining during the Q & A session . I really do hope he gets to make better films in the future . This one is strictly for genre fans , but I 'd recommend non-fans to give this a try anyway . It was a fun ride .  
1	  I believe I received this film when I was a young buck . I remembered watching it as a child , but i could never find the film . I remembered good ol Rageddy Ann , Andy , Babette , the Greedy , King Koo Koo . I searched high and low for this movie and still no luck . But one day when I was moving out of my childhood home I had found it . We were reunited . I am 17 years old now . I still watch it . All the time actually . It 's one of the funniest and touching movies I have ever seen and enjoyed at the same time . And personally I think they should make a sequel . Mmm , yes a sequel indeed . Now i am even considering getting the captains bird tattooed somewhere on my body !  
0	  This is the biggest piece of lamo I 've ever watched . It is excruciatingly boring I would have rather sat through a seminar on creationism than have watched this if i had known it was going to be as boring as it was . Not even the 40 seconds of the hot chick in the bikini with the big ta tas redeems this of anything lower than a 1 . The reviews of this movie claiming that this movie is " unintentionally funny " are absurd and just plain WRONG . Not one thing is funny about this movie . they spend the first 50 or so minutes walking through the woods talking about stuff you wouldn't understand nor care about and it is just as lame when the people start dying because you don't even know who the people are because they are so UNINTERESTING . Honestly though , I didn't watch it to the ending , but that should say something about how horrible it is . WORST MOVIE EVER . Immediately after ejecting this filth from my DVD player I started scraping it against the cement in front of my house , not wanting other blockbuster customers to have to fall upon the same mistake i had made as to rent this movie . Then Zach peed his pants . Thankyou for your time .  
1	  " If I wanted to dribble , I 'd call a nurse . " " Haven't you had enough ? " .. " More than enough . " " You got me a choo-choo . " " If I begin to die , please remove ( the cowboy hat ) from my head . That is not the way I wish to be remembered . " Some of the wonderfully humorous , and often insightful , quotations from this charming and often insightful film . Dudley Moore is charming , lovable and rich . Sir John Gielgud is aristocratic , charming and loving .. and poor . The two have a non-father / father and son relationship which defines the man whom Arthur is to become . Will he follow his heart and soul , or just his wealth ? Over twenty-five years , I 've returned to this movie , with glee and amusement and joy . It is a movie to return to , time and time again , and remember what is important in life , as short as it is . Judge Miller  
1	  In a poor village in Mexico , the Colonel ( Fernando Luján ) lives with his asthmatic wife Lola ( Marisa Paredes ) in an old house . Lola still grieves the death of their son Augustin some time ago . The colonel has been expecting for his pension of fighter in a war against Catholic church for almost twenty-seven years . However , for political reasons , the present government wants to forget this old fight . Without having any possession or money , but a valuable gamecock , they struggle to survival with the expectation of the acknowledgement letter from the government , recognizing the law and paying for the delayed pension . This slow and touching movie reflects the social and financial situation of most of the elder retired persons in third world countries . In Brazil , most of the retired persons has to survive with about US $ 80,00 per month . The debts of the colonel in the story were made to pay for a graveyard for his son , otherwise he would be buried as an indigent . Outstanding performance of the cast , in a very sad story that is reality in the poor countries . My vote is eight . Title ( Brazil ) : ( ` Não se Escreve ao Coronel ' ) ( Do not Write to the Colonel )  
0	  I think they really let the quality of the DVD production get away from them . I rented this DVD from 2 movie stores and the second time I finally got it to play on the 3rd DVD player I tried . Anyone else have this issue ? It 's really hard to give the film an un-biased review after going through such a hassle to play it . For one , I 've never seen a Finnish horror film before so I was sort of bummed that the movie was done in English . Also since it 's never made clear what is wrong with Sarah , she just came off as retarded and therefore I really just hoped someone would shoot her in the face and make all the horrific happenings go away .  
0	  I was skeptical when I first saw the Calvin Kline-esque commercials , but thought I 'd give it a chance . So I 've watched it , and all I can say is bleh . This movie was so bad . It 's rare that I hate a movie this much . Watching this flick reminded me of those funny scenes in Altman 's " The Player , " when the writers pitch their bizarre ideas to producers . I 'd like to know which MTV producer decided that an hour and a half long music video adaptation of Bronte ( but this time Heathcliff 's name is Heath and he 's a rock star , and Hindley 's name is Hendrix ) would be a good idea . Even that might not have been so bad , had they not gotten every other aspect of the film so horrible wrong as well . The direction must have been " you 're lonely , pout for me . " I laughed out loud during all the " serious " scenes and was bored throughout the rest . The camera work was jagged and repeatedly reminded me that I was watching a bad movie trying to be edgy . My theory is that the sound guy got bored and went down to the beach for a few beers with his boom - all I could hear in half the scenes were the waves . And in the other scenes , I wish that 's all I could hear . And speaking of sound , what they did to the Sisters of Mercy song " More " is absolutely inexcusable , then again , it 's inexcusable what they did to Bronte . On the bright side , there was one entertaining scene - specifically the moment when Johnny Whitworth licked Katherine Heigl 's face - and if you can tell me what that scene had to do with all the rest of the story more power to you .  
0	  Phantom of the Mall is a film that fits best in the " easily forgotten " category . It 's a pretty lousy variant on the famous story by Gaston Leroux , the Phantom of the Opera . Not a bad idea to itself , but the plot and production of this movie are way to weak to bring a decent homage to that story . On the bright side , Gaston Leroux doesn't has to turn over in his grave just yet . It could have been a lot worse . Phantom of the Mall has too many useless flashbacks in it and way too many boring sequences to make it memorable . Also , the scriptwriters wanted to give too much draught to the story than necessary . And even though there 's a lot of mystery getting build up about the character of Eric .. the basic plot is ordinary and déjà-vu . * SPOILERS * It 's about a young couple that brutally gets torn apart because the boy gets killed in a fire . That fire was set to his house because he and his parents refused to sell their home in order to make room for a huge mall to be build . The boy survived the fire and he has hidden himself in the mall to avenge himself . Meanwhile he guards his girl who now works in the mall and tries to forget her loss * END SPOILERS * This pretty simple - but rather effective - plot gets thickened by lots of pointless elements and annoying conspiracy theories . While it should just be an entertaining horror movie , it desperately tries to be an intelligent thriller .. and that 's not what the fans look for . There are a few innovative killings but they 're not satisfying enough for people who want to see a relaxing horror movie . And besides , Phantom of the Mall could have used at least a bit of humor ! This entire production - the cast included - takes itself way too serious . I 'll try to finish with a few positive aspects .. Like for example , it stars Ken Foree ! Die-hard horror fans will certainly recognize him as Peter for Dawn of the Dead ! That 's like the horror milestone that yet has to find an equal . Even though his role in this movie is limited and even completely unnecessary .. it was good to see him again . TV-movie fans will also recognize Morgan Fairchild as the mayor , she 's a fine actress and an elegant lady . Pauly Shore is also in this but I can't stand him .. so my opinion about him may be a bit biased . And finally , a bit of praise for the leading actress named Kari Whitman . She 's an extremely beautiful girl and she does have a bit of talent .. too bad she never made it to the top . Actually , this movie is her biggest achievement and that says enough about her career ..  
1	  Set in a middle class neighborhood in the imaginary town of Willard in the 1950s , this dark comedy with a light touch toys with such American obsessions as gun mania and violence , materialism and keeping up with the Joneses , fear of others , slavery , golf , and the disposing of the dead . Yes , it all sounds a bit heavy , but trust me on this , it 's nearly as light as a feather . Zombies are featured prominently among the characters . Crucial questions arise , such as : who will become a zombie ( 90 % of the Willard folks choose this final path , while only 10 % prefer a traditional funeral ) ? Who owns how many Zombies to do their bidding like robots ( they 've become a mark of social status ) ? And , what is the range of possible relationships that can be worked out between the living and the sort of reincarnated dead ? Somehow , director Andrew Currie , who also co-wrote the lively screenplay ( with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton ) , keeps this improbable material percolating along for an hour and a half without once faltering for want of a good laugh . A super cast helps : Carrie-Anne Moss , Billy Connolly , Dylan Baker , Henry Czerny , Tim Blake Nelson , Mary Black and Sonja Bennett are the principals , aided by young K'Sun Ray as Timmy , the innocent kid with a good heart who acts as fair witness to all the lunacy of the grownups . ( Having seen her only in " Memento " and " The Matrix , " I had no idea that Ms . Moss had such fine comedienne chops . ) The production design and music are exquisitely 50s , to a tee . Maybe this one isn't for everybody . It surely will be a hard film to beat for my annual Bizarro Award . But intelligent comedies that stay funny from start to finish are among the hardest won achievements in movie-making . For me anyway , " Fido " is a hoot ! My grades : 8.5/10 ( A- ) ( Seen on 01/30/07 )  
0	  This " Debuted " today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is " I am speechless " I taped it today so I could watch it tonight after work . I had high hopes , Now I am tearing apart the closets looking for a length of rope so I can hang myself . Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen . I wish I could say something nice like " It was fun to make fun of this movie " but this movie is giving me nothing to work with . I know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with out prior warning but I am going to anyway " This movie sucks " There I said it ! They should show this flick to film students to show them what NOT to do ! My nine year old niece could make a better film . The only decent thing about this film is the sound and / or sound track . OH ! I just found a rusty C-clamp in my old tool box . I am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen . I could just tape over this VHS but I think I will burn it in the fire pit instead . I could wash with soap but I fear I will never be clean again . Christmas is coming . Buy this movie and give it to people you hate . - Mike  
0	  This 1977 cult movie has two crazed lesbians ( Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp ) appearing at the home of wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning ( Seymour Cassel ) , in hope of help in locating a residence they can't seem to find . But these two have other plans in mind , when they find out George 's wife is out of town , they end up taking control of the residence , tying up the George , killing a delivery boy while destroying the place all in one evening . Bizarre and disturbing movie , but the two get there just reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends . Most will either dislike it right off or get caught up in this ludicrous movie after about 30 minutes into it . Either way some even consider this a cult classic . Larry Dodson  
1	  I was shocked and surprised by the negative reviews I saw on the web , I thought Cinderella 2 ( as well as 3 ) is a very cute and funny sequel for everyone - kids and adults .. like me , I am 22 years old . I also find it and very informative film , it shows lessons on being true to yourself and following your heart . I thought it has great animation , and the voice casting was very good ; the songs performed by Brooke Allison too . Since this film has been divided into three flashbacks / stories , my favorite out of the three , is the story of when Jaq the mouse , became a human for a day , thanks to Fairy Godmother and her magic .  
0	  Beating the bad guys .. Again is the tag line for this movie , it exposes so much truth about it . Home Alone one and two , film classics . Home Alone three and four , a good film if you 're three ! Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl , as hard as it tries to be funny , it 's not . Culkin is replaced by Alex D'Linz or something else . He 's a very bland actor with bland performances , but it 's not entirely his fault , the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions . The pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks , and you 'd have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real . A good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day . And to make things worst , a totally different cast , go see if you don't believe me , but you 'll regret it .  
0	  This is a fair little show about the paranormal although it feels as if Art Bell and his ilk figured out how to carve a career out of the attitude that Carl Kolchak exemplified . Of course there probably wouldn't be an X-Files if this show hadn't prepped this audience for it so well . Darren McGavin is not exactly the super-heroic type but he is a plausible ( enough ) guy to deliver heroic deeds . Check out his work on some of those old Alfred Hitchcock Presents . Here he is the main attraction , there doesn't seem to be a girlfriend or wife who 's a distraction . In fact there isn't a whole lot of sex appeal to the show . Something I 'm noticing as well is that the pacing isn't really suspenseful in a typical way . There 's a lot of throwaway humor to this show . Sometimes its just pokey to get to the climax . There 's a thread from this show coming all the way up to the present MAD MEN show in terms of style . Not that David Chase writes Mad Men but the people that worked under him on The Sopranos definitely have emulated and inherited his serio-comic tone .  
0	  I had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on Danish television yesterday . First of all , I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I wasn't disappointed . She looked gorgeous . Second of all , through reading about the film I had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in Philippe de Broca 's films . On this account , however , I was sadly disappointed . I found the jokes predictable ( apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war ) and the characters completely one-dimensional . Also , the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion , with no sense of drama at all . I kept watching until the end , but I got bored very quickly and just sat there , waiting for the scenes with Lollobrigida .  
0	  WARNING : I advise anyone who has not seen the film yet to not read this comment . Although I haven't seen them all , The Hamiltons sure did deliver one lowsy piece of entertainment , which it did not entertain me at all ! I thought that in common with the semi-bad acting , stupid plot scheme , and the twist at the end of the movie , which was very retarded , this movie sucked ! Okay , so supposively these are people who eat other people . Yeah .. notice I said people not humans , not because they aren't human , or wait I think they are , OH NO WAIT , THEY DIDN'T TELL YOU ! So okay , are these people cannibals , or are they imbreds , or what are THEY ! I mean , maybe they 're just " THINGS " that came here to see what people taste like or , are they cannibals who have eaten people for a long time now , or maybe this movie was HHOORRIIBBLLEE ! WHICH IT WAS ! So if you think The Hamiltons is good , I ask of you , why , why , WHY , WHY , why was it so awesome , because to me it was just flat out terrible ! One big BOO for The Hamiltons ! Go see The Gravedancers , Tooth & Nail , or Borderland for a piece of entertainment !  
1	  This is a feel-good movie and nothing more . And for that , it is great fun to watch . Sure it skims over political issues . But so what ? I am sure she wasn't trying to make ' Good Night and Good Luck ' here . Let 's not try to make it anything else but what it is .. light fare . And very enjoyable at that ! Do we remember what 1984 was like ? We 've become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not . I tend to differ on this point . Goldie knew this was fun-fluff and she went ahead and did it . Like her lightest fare : Protocol , Overboard , Housesitter , Wildcats , Private Benjamin , Seems Like Old Times , Foul Play , Death Becomes Her , First Wives Club and the remake of Out-of-Towners , GOLDIE knows what she is doing .. she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it ! Goldie just knows herself really well , and she knows what she can do really well . She has always made me laugh cheerfully and innocently . I loved her in Laugh-In and every thing she 's ever been in . She has never tried to be anything else but who she is .. and that 's that bubbling , giggly , girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always endear me and remind me that life is pretty short and you 've just got to lighten up because before you know it .. you are old , wrinkled and suffering from one of life 's inevitable ailments . If it even comes that late . I appreciate Goldie for what she is : a lovable , comic actress .  
0	  I was looking for a cute , simple comedy to pass the time but choosing this film proved to be an enormous mistake . I can't write a single good thing about it . First , the script is stupid and not funny at all , relying on tired , recycled jokes and a farting turtle for laughs . In my book , that 's not funny , that 's pathetic . Low budget ' effects ' ( if I can even call them effects ) with horrible cinematography . In many places it feels almost like an indie film shot with no money . Acting .. I feel sorry for the actors . Are Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards that desperate for some money that they 've agreed to take part in this ? ( looking at their recent filmography , it would appear so . ) Despite the outfits , Pamela is showing her age and as a whole , they don't even come across as sexy , let alone funny . This movie is not even in the so bad it is funny category . It 's just bad , as if everybody involved was sick of it . Avoid .  
1	  I thought this movie did a down right good job . It wasn't as creative or original as the first , but who was expecting it to be . It was a whole lotta fun . the more i think about it the more i like it , and when it comes out on DVD I 'm going to pay the money for it very proudly , every last cent . Sharon Stone is great , she always is , even if her movie is horrible ( Catwoman ) , but this movie isn't , this is one of those movies that will be underrated for its lifetime , and it will probably become a classic in like 20 yrs . Don't wait for it to be a classic , watch it now and enjoy it . Don't expect a masterpiece , or something thats gripping and soul touching , just allow yourself to get out of your life and get yourself involved in theirs . All in all , this movie is entertaining and i recommend people who haven't seen it see it , because what the critics and box office say doesn't always count , see it for yourself , you never know , you might just enjoy it . I tip my hat to this movie 8/10  
0	  Movies like these are to the originals what Album Oriented Rock stations are to what music used to be like - repetitive , boring , and drained of all the original energy by a committee of corporate drones . I AM glad that Aragorn wasn't typecast as an expectant psycho by this P.O.S. Go back and watch the 1971 version , count the things that would NEVER be included in a modern version , and thank whatever deity you worship that someone somewhere in the distant past had the balls to write and shoot an original concept movie that wasn't based on someone else 's ideas , and wasn't passed through a corporate board before it saw the light of day .  
1	  " Ardh Satya " is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema . Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani , this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success . Even today , Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India . The film tells the Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s . Unlike any Police of other cities in India , Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether . Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment . Amongst various Police officers & colleagues , the film describes the story of Anand Velankar , a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family . His father is a harsh Police Constable . Anand himself suffers from his father 's ideologies & incidences of his father 's Atrocities on his mother . Anand 's approach towards immediate action against crime , is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction . The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand 's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors . This leads to frustrations , as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction . Resulting from the frustrations , his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars , also turning him to an alcoholic . The Spirit within him is still alive , as he constantly fights the system . He is aware of the system of the Metro , where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end . His compromise towards unethical practice is negative . Finally he gets suspended . The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core . One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty 's house to arrest him , followed by short conversation which is fantastic . At many scenes , the film has Hair-raising moments . The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch . Alcoholism , Corruption , Political Influence , Courage , Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today . Those aspects are dealt brilliantly . Finally , the films belongs to the One man show , Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly .  
0	  This film really disappointed me . The acting is atrocious . Unbelievable . And it 's about actors . The story is incredibly obvious : A group of independent actors stage a Passion Play and , in turn , they start to live out the lives of the characters they play . I 've been watching a lot of movies lately , thanks to Netflix , and this is the first one I haven't watched all the way through in a long time . I felt I didn't need to see the end ; we all know the end of this story . For some , it seems , this " modernization " of the Gospels is either sacrilegious or enlightening . I cannot speak to any of this as I wasn't raised in the Christian church . That being said , I was raised in the US and I live in an increasingly Christian culture . I 'm curious enough about Jesus and about the modernization of the religion , for better or worse . I haven't seen Mel Gibson 's version , but I 'm guessing that those who liked that one will like this , except for the most conservative . I just wish this was a better film . Lots of these reviews praise Arcand 's direction and especially the cinematography . I liked neither . The film itself is rather prudish and preachy . I didn't believe the characters ' personae and I was never involved with their on screen lives . The play within the play is very much dated and would not , I think , carry it 's own weight in a real time production . But that 's beside the point . What I really needed for this to work would have been stronger development of the characters and the plot to support the philosophical and theological questions the film would like to be about . And the musical choices are obvious and unoriginal . There were two examples of this that come easily to mind . Firstly , there is a reenactment of the parable of Jesus driving the money lenders from the temple : the lead actor , who has fallen for the woman who will play Magdalene and who is also a model and dancer , becomes enraged that she must debase herself by auditioning for a commercial ( with a wicked producer and plenty of panting men in the audience ) with her pants off . He trashes the place and chases them all out . I guess this is the level that the film wishes to reach . The romance between these two is entirely arbitrary and not at all emotionally realized and the scene is played out like a high-school rendering of Death of a Salesman , i.e. , not well . Please stop hitting me over the head with this high-handed " significance . " The other is the relationship between the other female lead and the priest who has asked them to do the play and who , eventually , turns against them and betrays them to the nowadays-corrupt Church . Why . Why does she sleep with this guy . " It brings him so much pleasure and me so little pain . " Ah , the saintly whore and the lovable old coot . It seems to be just enough for Arcand to signify but not worth the trouble to enrich and enliven these characters . They are going through the motions and I 'm reaching for the eject button . Feel free to write me off as bored , jaded or just not interested . Feel free to watch this movie and see the Passion , in all its beauty , sadness and inspiration , delivered as an amateurish and gimmicky charade . Feel free to have all your preconceived ideas affirmed and see any shred of artistic integrity forsaken for monotonous drivel . But don't say I didn't warn you .  
0	  First of all , I was expecting " Caged Heat " to be along the same lines as " Ilsa , The Wicked Warden " . Boy , was I wrong ! In no way is this film 70s exploitation , " chix in chains " , or " women in prison " . Sure , the plot consists of a bunch of women in prison , who wear street clothes btw ( quite comical ) , but NOTHING happens . There aren't strong rivalries , no one tries to seduce the warden or doctor in order to try and escape , and no inmates make out . There are 2 shower scenes , that I suspect is just recycled footage , but no fights breaks out / no one is seduced here - or anywhere for that matter ! Aside from the lack of plot , unconvincing , unsympathetic , and flat characters , a couple of inmates that do manage to escape actually return to the prison in order to " free " their fellow inmates ? ! PUH-LEASE , the movie should have just ended off with the escapees riding off into the sunset .. as opposed to letting this mess continue ! I feel scammed .  
0	  OK , the movie is good but I give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale . This kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron 's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus . First of all , strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus . An organic virus is much more complex , even though it 's way tinier . Though , it 's considered one of the simplest forms in the universe , organic virus 's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the RNA , then change your own RNA code . Explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor ? Maybe the radiation has some effect on the user 's cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses ? I could see that , but obviously , the writer didn't think of that .  
1	  After 21 movies and three years of working in Hollywood Bette Davis finally got a role she claimed as her own and which put her as a force to be reckoned with . As Mildred Rogers , Davis burst forth with a completely unsympathetic role of a slutty waitress who becomes the target of Leslie Howard 's affections , and already eager to sink her teeth into a role like this , she had no qualms of the awful things her character was meant to do throughout the course of the film and the awful transformation she would undergo . It also has been widely noted that her performance here , one of the few things that makes this slightly uneven movie watchable , has been the one to remember even after two remakes and the scenes where she rips into Howard have made cinema history . At circa 85 minutes , the story moves at a nice pace , telling the story of Philip Carey ( Howard ) as his life crosses that of the destructive Mildred Rogers over and over again . Howard and Davis ' chemistry is all but non-existent - Davis sustained in an interview much later in life she personally didn't care much for Howard 's iciness towards her and that helped her act even worse ( in character ) towards him as Mildred . All the same , the two seem awkward with one another ; their scenes together remain stiff , only salvaged by the ferocious acidity Davis brings to her lines and her own nervous presence . Then again , Cromwell 's direction has a certain stiltedness about itself that fails to come through at times - he tries to fill in some space ( whenever Davis is not there ) with dissolves and montages indicating the passing of time ( a calendar superimposed over a changing Frances Dee ) . All much in the style back then . This was before technicalities and complicated camera angles came into being , and in essence , the visual story is a simplified , bare essentials translation of the Somerset Maugham 's novel - which is saying a lot , since at 600 pages , " Of Human Bondage " would have been indeed hard to film even then . Storywise , it feels that Philip Carey may be something of a glutton for punishment , since there is no discernible , sexual attraction between he and Mildred and to compound that , Mildred never hides her displeasure from the get-go . Howard 's performance never seems to go through much external emotion - his eyes are constantly sad , his expression never veers too far away from lost ( he could almost be a distant cousin to William Hurt in " The Accidental Tourist " - dejected , hurt , and absolutely passive ) , but this is possibly a part of his character and the reason he fails to see that other women ( played by Kay Johnson and Frances Dee ) are making themselves vulnerable to unrequited affections . Interestingly , Johnson 's Norah , once she realizes Carey will never fall for her , is the one who sums the story up with her observation that people are bound to other people - she is bound to Carey as Carey is bound to Mildred , and Mildred herself is bound to Miller ( or men who fit the role of provider ) . In her short but memorable scene , she 's the one who holds the essence of the story 's moral .  
1	  The film revolves around a man who believes that all forms of media are obsolete . The idea behind his art project is to unmask the ridiculous culture that we are bathed in . Naturally , the film takes place in Los Angeles / Orange County . He attacks stand up comics ( caw , caw , caw ) , rock bands , models , blockbuster Hollywood films , and touches on many other mediums . Eventually , he finds himself in the sights of the weapon he has set into motion . The film is five years old and rings more true every day . It 's the best description of post-punk anger I 've ever seen . It 's also one of my top 10 favorite films .  
1	  THE ODD COUPLE ( 3 + outta 5 stars ) Like most people I will always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the definitive " Odd Couple " . Their incredible work on the TV series from the early to mid-70s was a highwater mark for television at the time .. easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale . Nonetheless , how can you go wrong with a Jack Lemmon / Walter Matthau pairing ? Matthau is in especially good form as Oscar , the slob . Lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as Felix , particularly if you have previously seen Tony Randall 's outstanding performance . The script is good .. definitely Neil Simon 's best . ( I will go on record here as stating that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst , most over-rated playwrights of American theatre . ) The storyline is simple : Felix , a neat freak and newly separated from his wife moves in with Oscar , the slob who needs some help saving money for alimony payments . Their living arrangement becomes much like a marriage as well , culminating in some amusing tiffs and spats . Lots of fun and some great one-liners .  
1	  I have to say , Seventeen & Missing is much better than I expected . The perception I took from the previews was that it would be just humdrum but I was pleasantly surprised with this impressive mystery . Dedee Pfeiffer is Emilie , a mom who insists her daughter , Lori ( Tegan Moss ) , not attend a so-called graduation party one weeknight , but Lori ignores her mother 's wishes and takes off for the party anyway . When Lori does not come home , Emilie knows something is wrong and she begins to have visions of her daughter and the events that led to her disappearance . Seventeen & Missing is better than so many other TV movies of this type , as it is not so predictable . Pfeiffer is the reason to see this movie , and most of it comes off as believable . This LMN Original Movie premiered last night . 10/10  
1	  Very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas . Can't say much about this film without giving away the story . I can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture . Everybody has his or her own agenda . Nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises . Well written with good performances by all .  
1	  Thankfully as a student I have been able to watch " Diagnosis Murder " for a number of years now . It is basically about a doctor who solves murders with the help of his LAPD son , a young doctor and a pathologist . DM provided 8 seasons of exceptional entertainment . What made it different from the many other cop shows and worth watching many times over was its cast and quality of writing . The main cast gave good performances and Dick Van Dyke 's entertainer roots shone through with the use of magic , dance and humor . The best aspects of DM was the fast pace , witty scripts and of course the toe tapping score . Sadly it has been unfairly compared to " Murder , She Wrote " . DM is far superior boasting more difficult mysteries to solve and more variety . Now it is gone TV is a worse place . Gone are the days of feelgood , family friendly cop shows . Now there is just depressing ' gritty ' ones .  
1	  Spielberg 's first dramatic film is no let-down . It 's a beautifully made film without any flaws about the life of an African-American woman . It also proves that not all movies that have the African-American ethnicity as the center of the story have to be helmed by an African-American director . What I love about this movie is Spielberg 's ability to make it very realistic despite the fact that it was based on a book . Furthermore , Danny Glover was excellent as Mr. And usually , he 's just himself throughout most of his movies . But in this , he completely branches out and is someone else for once . But , the performance de resistance of the whole film comes from Whoopi Goldberg . She is excellent as Celie . You will never forget these characters once you 've seen this movie . Now , I heard that the musical version of it is going to be a film as well , and all I can say is : I hope it 's about as good as this one is , because this one is a film that shouldn't be missed .  
1	  If there 's one genre that I 've never been a fan of , it 's the biopic . Always misleading , filled with false information , over-dramatized scenes , and trickery all around , biopics are almost never done right . Even in the hands of the truly talented directors like Martin Scorsese ( The Aviator ) and Ron Howard ( A Beautiful Mind ) , they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen . Skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the Notorious Bettie Page was no different . Some critics and moviegoers objected to Gretchen Mol given the role of Bettie Page , saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the chops for the part . I never doubted Mol could handle the part since , but I never expected to as blown as away by her performance as I was upon just viewing the film hours ago . Mol delivers a knockout Oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950 's pin-up girl , who , after an early life of abuse ( depicted subtlety and tastefully done , something few directors would probably do ) inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time . The picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots , there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story . Director / co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner 's fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending . Still , credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully . Come Oscar time , Mol , Turner , and Harron should be receiving nominations . Doubt it will happen , though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them . 9/10  
0	  Absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen ! The acting , the dialog , the manuscript , the sound , the lighting , the plot line . I actually can't say anything positive about this , although I enjoy Swedish movies . The fighting scenes are so ridiculous that it 's impossible to take it seriously . And when the lead character just happens to loose his shirt , while dodging bullets in a strip bar , I 'm not sure if it 's supposed to be a joke , or if someone really thinks these are ingredients in a good film ? ! Regina Lund is the only half descent actor , but she disappears in a flood of laughable pronunciations and unbelievable reactions . It leaves you horrified that someone actually spent time and money on something like this ..  
0	  If I have to give this movie a score on a linear scale , then I have to give it a low score 3/10 . But it was entertaining , and there are several good things to say about the movie . The psychiatrist candidate James Bishop is assigned to St . Andrews Hospital for his resident , and is exited and eager to " change the world " . From the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital is hiding an evil truth , but James thinks he can make a difference and doesn't recognise this evil . The story builds fairly well , you know all the time that there is a truth in what the patients are telling about some resident evil , and wonder when and how James will discover this . Also when the break comes , James is in a way hunted by the evil , and you feel some suspense until " the fight " is over . Add an innocent beautiful girlfriend that arrives at the worst possible time and other standard horror elements , and you get the picture . The character buildup is actually fairly good , you are introduced to most of the people that gets killed , some of them you " get to know " . The film sets an unpleasant scene , this is also done fairly well . There are mysteries that are unveiled - in an acceptable way . The main character , James is very believable - the story about an eager student starting to work is good in this setting . What kills this movie is : * Stupid special effects - a modern version of " Plan 9 from outer space " - type bad ( the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow ) * Some bad acting ( or probably very few takes when filming ) - The main characters sometimes acts badly , and somtimes good . * The sound is at times very cheap . I kept thinking " I could make a movie like this with my home video camera " throughout the film .  
0	  The movie and acting are not bad and Jay Hernandez does a good job playing Calito Brigante but the movie forgets it 's suppose to be a prequel to a hit movie . The makers of this prequel clearly did not watch the original Carlito 's Way or at least did not care about continuity . This movie is a prequel which means the original movie has already laid out some history for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least lead up to it . Not one of Carlito 's close old friends from the original make an appearance in this movie , they 're not even mentioned . Luis Guzman , Pachanga in the original , is in the movie but he plays a completely different character . The original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969-70 . Considering this movie takes place less than 5 years earlier , wouldn't you think one of Carlito 's long time friends would make an appearance ? In the original , Carlito start 's out being released from jail after spending 5 years in jail . That 's only a few month 's between the end of the prequel and the start of the original ! * Semi Spoiler * We know from the beginning of the original , Carlito has spent 5 years in prison so when the prequel gives us this Hollywood happy ending it 's an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original . What happen to Gail ? It 's the lack of continuity that made this film go direct to video release .  
0	  Prom Night is about a girl named Donna ( Brittany Snow ) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night . And by doing so killing her family , friends , and her enemies . Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately . Are you tired of stupid girl dialog ' Oh my god ' and talking about girlish things . And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying . And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian , Japanese , and Chinese films . That pretty much sums up Prom night but I 'm still not done with the review . The only reason to see ' Prom night ' is to crack a laugh at the kills . If not , don't see Prom night . You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall . And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7 . So not only aren't they scary but it 's obnoxious . By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl . Too much girl talk , too much guy talk , and lots of ' Oh my gosh . It 's our prom ' . I understand it 's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate . If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I 'd be the first one too . I 'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick . Seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting , cheap scares , and a ' Night to die for ' when watching the film . 1 star out of 10 . ( P.S. If I could give the film zero stars I would ) .  
0	  Generally I don't like films directed by Sydney Pollack ( " The Firm " being somewhat of an exception ) and I 've never been a Robert Redford fan either . Still , I thought " Three Days of the Condor " must be good because of the number of praising comments it has received . Although the widescreen cinematography is quite pleasing for the eye and Max von Sydow does a nice job as the sinister professional killer , I found the whole affair tremendously disappointing . The film undeniably radiates paranoid atmosphere , but everything is ruined by the muddled plot which doesn't seem to make any sense . The film also contains one of the most unsatisfying endings I have ever seen which really leaves the viewer hanging in the air . And what can one say about that absurd romance between Redford and Dunaway ? I 'd much rather watch any of Hitchcock 's films five times in succession than to sit through this piece of waste once more .  
1	  This , the finest achievement from Georg Wilhelm Pabst 's Social Realism period is based upon a tragedy in early 1906 that claimed the lives of nearly 1100 French miners as a coal dust explosion deep in mines at Courrieres in northern France took place after a fire had smouldered for three weeks , eventually releasing deadly pit gas that brought about the fatalities . Estimable designer Erno Metzner creates stark sets that simulate the tragedy , providing a perception of reality , augmented by matchless sound editing , with the only music being produced by integral orchestras during the beginning and ending portions of a work for which aural effects possess equal importance with the eminent director 's fascinating visual compositions . Pabst 's manner of " invisible editing " that segues action from shot to shot through movements of players proves to be smoothly integrated within this landmark film that also showcases sublime cinematography utilizing cameras mounted upon vehicles , enabling the director to shift amid scenes without having a necessity of cutting . Although the work 's cardinal theme relates to Socialist dogma , the unforgettable power of this film is held in its details , born of Pabst 's nonpareil skill at weaving numerous plot lines into a cinema tapestry that stirs one to admiration for German rescue squads of whom their Fatherland is greatly proud while no less despairing of disastrous losses to the families of French victims ; certainly , a seminal triumph fully as stimulating today to a cineaste as it was at the time of its first release .  
0	  After seeing the previews I felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast & furious series . So , I already expected it to have a lacking storyline , but at least this time it won't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans . Unfortunately , I was wrong . If you could only imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you . This is the absolute worst movie I had ever seen ( I 'm being nice - no I would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said ) . Not only was the storyline non-existent , but the action was crap too . I guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie . For an example , there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a SLR McLaren to win . And after the bit where Eddy Griffin got in a fight with one of his " girls " ( an Imus comment would work in this case ) the girl asks to pull over and get out of the PLANE and of course they do in the middle of the desert . After this wonderful scene I couldn't take it anymore . So , I only got to see half of this monstrosity . This is the first movie I had ever walked out on . Afterwards , I had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells . I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option . You 're better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home . I will keep all viewers in my prayers .  
0	  ( Spoilers ) I was very curious to see this film , after having heard that it was clever and witty . I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt . The idea behind the film would have been acceptable : depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves , through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience . What made me dislike the whole film were two things . First of all , the film was so down-to-earth that it looked as if , by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day-to-day basis , it became itself ordinary and dull . Secondly , the overall sloppiness of the production , with dialogues that were barely understandable . Too bad .  
0	  ( Some possible spoilers ) I 'm not too sure what Dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk $ 80 million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick . They probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences ( mostly families ) to see it in droves . Well it seemed to work for the opening weekend , it made $ 26 mil . , roughly and has made $ 38.1 mil . total ( an estimation for this weekend ) . But I think audiences that came during the weekend saw pretty much the same thing I did , when I saw and they spread the word . This is one majorly lame movie , apart from the animation everything else , mostly the script seem to be done by a three year old . The movie is only about 80 mins . long , but it feels like a three hour epic . A few sticking points for me are , well the irritating narration is one of them , and it 's so obviously written . At one point he escapes from some captors and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared , up pops the narrator ( the voice of the talented Matt Damon ) to clear up any misconceptions ( which would only happen in the simplest of mindsets . Another one is the constant pop up of Bryan Adams songs , now I 'm a fan of his music , I think he 's good , but come on did Dreamworks really think audiences would be able to handle 8-9 of his songs throughout such a short movie , I certainly couldn't . Finally and here 's a spoiler , a horse gets shot at point blank range by a member of the calvary , no less , she ( the horse ) then falls into a raging river , Spirit ( the focus of the movie ) tries to save her , but they both go over a waterfall that must have at least a 50 foot drop , well later in the movie near the end we see that this horse is alive and well . Now I know this is a kids movie , but even that little amount of realism is unacceptable . To sum up , this is a really lame movie , I 'm not saying kids won't enjoy it , but anyone else will be checking their watches just waiting for this tripe to end . Definitely on my Top 10 worst list of this year . - * out of 4 stars .  
1	  I had no idea of the facts this film presents . As I remember this situation I accepted the information presented then in the media : a confused happening around a dubious personality : Mr. Chavez . The film is a revelation of many realities , I wonder if something of this caliber has ever been made . I supposed the protagonist was Mr. Chavez but everyone coming up on picture was important and at the end the reality of that entelechy : the people , was overwhelming . Thank you Kim Bartley and Donnacha O´Briain .  
0	  Most would agree that the character of Wolverine is one of the most intriguing characters in comic book history . I 'm no Marvel expert , but I did grow up with the adventures of the X-Men and definitely approved of Hugh Jackman 's now widely known portrayal of the scruffy Logan . I enjoyed the first X-Men , found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment . All through the three movies , I probably enjoyed Jackman more than anything else . I figured the idea of making an " origins " - movie about Wolverine could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three X-Men movies . If we concentrate on one character , I figured there could be a movie that achieves what I found the second movie failed at - being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventure . The reason that the Wolverine-movie fails is not because the competition is tougher after The Dark Knight . It 's not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and rudimentary - even though that certainly isn't good - no , it 's because the movie doesn't even seem to try . To begin with , this does not qualify as good entertainment . There is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very , very automatic . With no greater special effects or elements of suspense , and when one event will make you predict the following five , it almost feels like an Uwe Boll movie , imitating an action / adventure movie concept that you 've seen a dozen times before . Of course , nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of Bolls * t but when everybody 's talking clichés as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard , you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enough . But there is an even bigger problem . Even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and , by the way , that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character stupidities . I think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title . I mean , " Origins " . Really ? What to the people behind this movie think about that title ? What do they mean ? You want to know the origins of Wolverine ? He grew up with his brother . They ran away from home during dramatic circumstances . Then they went off to war . All of them ! The Civil War , World War I and II and Vietnam too . Why did they do this ? Still unknown . Eventually , the brother ( Sabertooth , played by Liev Shrieber ) became evil . " How ? " you ask . I don't know , it was somewhere between Omaha Beach and Hanoi . " Yeah , but why ? " you still ask . I just said I don't know ! The movie doesn't explain . He 's evil alright ! " Yeah , but .. you know , ' origins ' " .. Yeah , well that 's an origin ! I mean , duh ! Anyway , eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers . Something with the government , ho-hum . Wolvie gets enough and leave his brother . For six years he 's a happy lumberjack with a loved one , who ends up a little defenseless around the time Sabretooth suddenly appears again . " Yeaah .. but .. whyy ? " - Oh shut up ! - and Wolvie decides to be a guinneapig for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a flesh-covered metal war animal . He goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped , cue X-Men the first movie . There . That 's the origin . You can also find it on the back of the DVD cover . The actual movie won't tell you anything else . With no worthwhile scenes of action , no good heroes , villains or characters in general ( lines from my couch audience : Fat suit ! Token black guy ! Oh , I give you 200 in cash if that girl survives this movie .. , That is supposed to be Gambit .. ? mmhm , yeah well .. uh-huh , right ) , not one line of memorable dialog and zero lines to cover a T-shirt with , added to that the common stupid things that ruin the plausibility in general that you might usually forgive .. well , that sounds pretty much like a waste of time , right ? Fans will check this out , or have already . There 's no stopping that . But if you liked the X-Men movies for no other reason than that they were well-made and entertaining - see them again and do yourself no favors by trying to look for origins where there are none .  
1	  The War Between the States was perhaps the darkest hour in the history of America ; a war that pitted brother against brother and family against family and left scars that even today have not yet healed , and in all probability never will . And , as in any story about any war , beyond any historical significance it is the personal discord behind the greater conflict that creates the emotional impetus that makes it involving . It is the human element that renders the context necessary to give it perspective , which is what director Ang Lee provides in ` Ride With the Devil , ' a Civil War drama in which he focuses on the personal travails within the broader depiction of the War itself , and along the way manages to include an examination of one of the bloodiest chapters of the War , the infamous raid on Lawrence , Kansas , by Quantrill and his raiders , which he succeeds in presenting quite objectively from the Confederate point-of-view . In 1863 , the Union influence predominates in the State of Kansas , and even across the border in neighboring Missouri , those with Confederate loyalties are finding it increasingly difficult to hold out against the encroaching Northerners , especially without the aid of what could be considered any ` regular ' Confederate troops . And when things begin to really heat up around their own town , Jack Bull Chiles ( Skeet Ulrich ) and Jake Roedel ( Tobey Maguire ) form a band of their own and join in the fray , doing damage to the Union cause wherever it is practicable . Jack Bull and Jake do not like the War and do not like killing ; but they are standing up for what they believe to be right . There are others , however , even among their own , men like the young Pitt Mackeson ( Jonathan Rhys-Meyers ) , who will use the conflict as a vehicle for personal gain and as nothing more than an excuse to express their own violent nature through unnecessary brutality , perpetrated in many instances against innocent victims . And so , for Jack Bull and Jake , as well as many just like them , it becomes a time in which loyalty and moral judgments will be sorely tested ; a time during which their souls will be tempered in blood . And they will have to ride with the very Devil himself , against seemingly insurmountable odds . As with all of his films , director Ang Lee approaches his story through an incisive , yet subtle examination of the traditions , cultural aspects and moral attitudes of the people and times he is depicting . And in so doing , Lee provides his audience with at least some understanding of his subject that goes beyond the actual story and ultimately offers , perhaps , a deeper grasp of the motivations that propel his characters and the drama in which they are engaged . Whether it 's the traditions and customs that account for the relationship between a father and his daughters ( ` Eat Drink Man Woman ' ) , the effects of class distinction ( ` Sense and Sensibility ' ) , the honor and code by which a warrior lives and dies ( ` Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon ' ) or the moral ambiguities fostered by a lack of all of the above ( ` The Ice Storm ' ) , Lee infuses his films with insights into the human condition that take them to a higher level . This film is no exception ; and ( as he does with all his films ) , Lee presents his story with the aid of breathtaking cinematography ( in this film , by Frederick Elmes , who also did ` The Ice Storm ' brilliantly ) , which under his guidance is nothing less than visual poetry . It 's that special Lee touch , and it adds a wistful , reflective sense to whatever story he is telling , which is one of the elements that make his films so memorable . As Jake , Tobey Maguire initially brings a sense of youthful innocence to the film that contrasts so effectively with the maturity he conveys later on as the story develops , and his character along with it . Most importantly , Maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him , which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation : His stoic acceptance of death and the news of those ` murdered ' in the various skirmishes and battles ; the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere , even in such troubled times ; the betrayal , which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace ; and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly . It is all of this that Maguire achieves through his performance , and it is no small accomplishment . It is , however , the kind of studied , understated performance that is often taken for granted , which is unfortunate ; work like this is worthy of acclaim , and should be recognized . Skeet Ulrich is effective , as well , as Jack Bull , and Jewel ( in her motion picture debut ) turns in an engaging performance as Sue Lee Shelley . It is Jeffrey Wright , however , who stands out in a notable supporting role as Daniel Holt , as well as Jonathan Rhys-Meyers , who brings a chilling Christopher Walken-like menace to his role of Pitt . Also , in what amounts to a cameo role ( one scene ) , Mark Ruffalo leaves an indelible impression with very little screen time . The supporting cast includes James Caviezel ( Black John ) , Simon Baker ( George Clyde ) , Tom Guiry ( Riley ) , Tom Wilkinson ( Orton Brown ) , John Ales ( Quantrill ) , John Judd ( Otto Roedel ) and Kathleen Warfel ( Mrs. Chiles ) . The Civil War will forever be an open wound upon the nation ; but hopefully , as time goes on , it will be through the objective contemplations of filmmakers like Ang Lee and films like ` Ride With the Devil ' that will ultimately help to close the schism and promote healing . In light of more recent events , it is something that is sorely needed , worldwide . Film is a powerful medium ; it can be educational as well as entertaining , and perhaps in the future more filmmakers , like Ang Lee , will embrace and promote a sense of unity through the sensitive depiction of the events and attitudes that make us what we are . 8/10 .  
0	  This movie was absolute torture . First of all , it 's a whopping 4 + hours long ! True , the Kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for , but every single one of those battles need not have been shown . So maybe this is a documentary , not a commercial film as advertised . Sure didn't seem like it , as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws . The battle sequences were so poorly executed . I am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in Border . Each battle was the exact same as the previous . It was so predictable . ( This might be a spoiler . ) The whole army marches uphill , five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each ( they also use the same cussword every time ) , one of the lead actors is shot , someone yells for a stretcher , the actor says , " No , don't get a stretcher . That will take 6 men from the battalion , " and then an actor dies . That exact same thing happens over and over and over again . Oh , and the songs are so bad and so long . The cast of the movie is too big for its own good . Despite such a long movie , none of the characters were well developed . The actresses had the most miniscule roles . They all are dressed and portrayed to be the same . Two of them were weeping synchronized . It was so comical . They moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their dupatta together . The list just goes on and on . I know I 'm still forgetting something . Anyways , I think I have bashed the film enough that you get the picture .  
0	  Recap : Doctor Markov has developed a new theory how to produce energy , knowledge that might unbalance the world . He keeps his knowledge coded and secret and desperately wants out of the Soviet Union . KGB on the other side desperately wants the new technology . So , they sets a scheme in motion . During a rescue attempt to free Markov , KGB steps in , takes Markov to a secret location and lures him to reveal his secret by saying they are in Sweden , and working for the UN . As a backup , KGB kidnaps Markov 's estranged daughter . CIA now send their best agents , a team of ( Swedish ? ) Ninjas to thwart KGB and rescue Markov and his daughter . Comments : A cult movie that despite not being very good needs seeing . The movie is quite ambitious but lacking in many areas . First off is that it is very dark , probably to conceal locations and bad effects , that some scenes are hard to comprehend . You can't see what is happening . The second thing that it is lacking is martial arts , despite being a ninja-movie . Sure there are some , of quite poor quality , but mostly the ninjas fires automatic guns or sets of explosions . The automatic guns pose a problem too as they seem to have a endless supply of ammunition . And the ninjas seem almost immune to bullets while Soviet guards die like flies . What does it have that speaks for it then ? The idea and ambition foremost . Some actually , and especially for a Swedish movie , decent action-scenes albeit not of martial arts . Some nice slow-motion scenes and pretty much blood and gore . And some very interesting new weapons technology that makes the victims heart or brain explode . Mostly all parts that you look for in a B-movie . Because it definitely is a B-movie , no mistake could be made there . But if you expect it , and watch it like a B-movie , it is entertaining . But don't forget , it is not only a B-movie it is set in the eighties . Some girls , for example , besides wearing .. lets say " interesting " clothes , have lethal doses of eye shadow and makeup . In all , see for the cult status and the ambition . Enjoy it , and then forget it . 4/10  
0	  I am an avid fan of violent exploitation cinema , who would never attack a film for being violent or disturbing . I consider " Cannibal Holocaust " a masterpiece and will always defend controversial films like " Day Of The Woman " or " Last House on the Left " as genuine classics . Anyone who browses through my other user comments will notice that I am actually very pro-violence / gore when it comes to films . However , I do think that there should be at least some point to the violence . This piece of crap doesn't have any point whatsoever . The first film in the notorious " Guinea Pig " series , " The Devil 's Experiment " ( 1985 ) is widely controversial , but , as opposed to many other controversial films , this stinker has nothing at all to be recommended for . I must say that , before seeing any of the Guniea-Pig films , I already had a feeling that I would hate this one , knowing what it was about . Due to its status as one of the most controversial films around , however , I decided I had to see it . I am very glad I didn't waste any money on this pile of crap , and I sure wish I hadn't wasted my time with it either . This thing 's story ( I don't even want to call it a ' film ' ) : It doesn't have one . Three scumbags torture a woman to death for some excruciating 40 minutes . That 's it . There is no artistic value , no ' shocking ' story , no suspense ; nothing . Simply the disbelief that a film that shows NOTHING except for a woman being tortured for no reason enjoys an enormous cult-following . It IS disturbing , I give it that . Of course it is disturbing to watch a torture video for 40 minutes . What is more disturbing , however , is the fact that many people actually seem to regard this pile of garbage as some kind of masterpiece . I really cannot figure why . The fact that the gore effects look realistic cannot be the reason , I hope . The girl who plays the victim isn't a very good actor , and reacts very calm to all the torture . That makes the film look less realistic , which is , in this single case , a good thing . This is a film that is sickening ; not for its gore , but for its redundancy , its existence for the sole purpose of showing 40 minutes of torture . I strongly oppose any form of censorship . Since this is 100 % fake and nobody got hurt during its production , it IS legitimate to make such a film . However , I cannot think of a single reason why anyone would like this , other than the morbid desire to watch suffering and the enjoyment of torture . This film 's sequel " Flowers of Flesh and Blood " gained notoriety when actor Charlie Sheen mistook it for an actual snuff film and informed the FBI . Fortuneately , the film turned out to be fake . Overall , " The Devil 's Experiment " is a fake torture / snuff film that seems to have the sole purpose of looking as close to a real snuff film as possible . " The Devil 's Experiment " is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune of sitting through . Don't torture yourself by giving this piece of crap a try for its controversial status . Do yourself a favor and avoid it . Zero stars out of 10 , I wish there was a negative scale in order to appropriately rate this pile of crap .  
0	  This movie fails miserably on every level . I have an idea , let 's take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east . Maybe if we 're lucky they 'll all be shot and killed and we won't have to ever have our time wasted by them again . Did I mention that I have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life ? My god , I can't think of anything I 've ever seen that was this bad . I 'd rather watch Ishtar 25 times in a row than sit through 10 minutes of this sorry excuse for a film . If I ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film , I 'll spit in their face and then beat them senseless . That 's my two cents .  
0	  I was one of those " few Americans " that grew up with all of Gerry Andersen 's marvelous creations . Thunderbirds was a great series for the time and would have made a great action / adventure movie if only the writers could have figured out where to target it . I expected it to be a romp , but I did not expect it to aim at such a low age group . Like Lost in Space , this could have been both visually stunning and exciting . It should have focused on more action / adventure and the goal of the original series .. saving people in trouble . Instead , it focused on Alan saving the day instead of his brothers ( who were cast too young anyway vs . the original ) . The breakout part was Lady Penelope and Parker . I didn't care too much for the characters in the original , but I was grateful for them in the movie . They stole the show ! I always enjoyed Thunderbirds more for the high-tech than the stories , and even that did not get enough screen time as far as I was concerned . I would have enjoyed seeing more of the cool gadgets . But then , I 'm just a big kid .. ;)

0	  Well . this was not a surprise . many people will tell you this is gory . but they are all talking " shiztz " this film is very slow . It starts off with some guy who makes a concoction to feel no pain he calls it " my son " there is some gory scenes but i found them kind of weak . you might as well skip 40 minutes of the movie and get to the eyeball scene which was surprisingly impressive and sickening . there is some really stupid scenes in this . and they dub over the hits and slaps with stupid fake slapping sound which makes me laugh ! i would not recommend it . keep looking gore hounds . check this out if you want the like 20-10 minute ending scene which still is not that amazing and has a random scene of the guy trying to like rape his mum .. yeah its weird .  
0	  " New Best Friend " is another entry in the " steal another woman 's life " sub-genre ; the best of which are " Single White Female " and " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ; the worse of which you can catch almost any afternoon on the Lifetime Channel . For some reason this type of identity theft happens exclusively to women . There are just two basic ways to play this type of story . You can make the woman evil at the beginning and let the audience watch knowingly as she hatches and implements her evil scheme . Or you use misdirection to make her appear a good person , as a seemingly unplanned series of events break in her favor until she is revealed to be evil in the climatic scene . Unfortunately the makers of " New Best Friend " could not decide how they wanted to play it and things crash and burn early . We first meet Alicia ( Mia Kirshner ) scamming the college 's financial aid office for scholarship money . We now know that she is a bad person and will view all her subsequent activity with suspicion . But the director and editor apparently forgot that this revelation had been made and spend the next 50 minutes laying misdirection to make us think that Alicia is a good person . This introduces the only element of suspense , not about whether she is evil but about when the director and editor will wise up and stop wasting our time with transparent misdirection . " New Best Friend " suffers more than most from the teen movie curse of a cast too old to be portraying undergraduate students . There are really only two big parts , Hadley ( Meredith Monroe ) and Alicia ( Kirshner ) . They were 31 and 26 respectively at the time of the production . It almost works for the 26 year-old Kirshner when she plays the mousy version of Alicia but it becomes glaring when she is transformed into the glamed-up version of Alicia . Monroe 's casting is simply a joke , about like having Nicholette Sheridan try to pass as a classmate on " Lizzie McGwire " . She looks much closer to a mid-life crisis than to a term paper . The producers must have owed a lot of favors because this age issue extends to most of the supporting characters . Taye Diggs who plays the town sheriff is younger than most of the students . The basic setup is that Hadley and two other rich party girls ( played by Dominque Swain-age 21 and Rachel True-age 35 ) are undergrad roommates at college . They share ( as their student residence ) a mansion that is nicer and better furnished than the mansion on Real World-New Orleans ( a premise more believable than soccer moms playing students ) . Alicia moves into the mansion and begins to take over Hadley 's life . At least that way Swain finally gets a roommate from her own generation so the two can have a lesbian scene . Swain 's supporting performance is the only good thing about " New Best Friend " and her love scene with Kirshner is fantastic , so cool and artsy that it doesn't fit with any of the other segments , maybe it was subcontracted out to a good director and cinematographer . The unintentionally hilarious story is presented in a series of dreary flashbacks of rampant sex and nonstop parties , each proceeded by a shot of a comatose Alicia in a hospital bed . About half of Kirshner 's screen time is spent lying motionless with a tube in her mouth . Not a good career move Mia . Then again , what do I know ? I 'm only a child .  
1	  An excellent period murder melodrama , with Fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type , in a role that reportedly Olivia DeHavilland turned down . That 's fine , because Fontaine is wonderful . Scripted by Charles Bennett , who had written for Hitchcock in the thirties and also later penned the excellent script for the classic British horror film Night of the Demon . The opening scene , where Ivy visits a sinister fortune teller played by the wonderful Una O'Connor ( the screecher of James Whale fame ) , is a tour de force , and the film maintains interest throughout the numerous sinister machinations . I hope to see this film on DVD someday , but despair of that ever happening , because it seems to be an undeservedly obscure film . Fortunately I got to see it on AMC some seven or eight years ago , but have not seen since . Catch it if you can !  
1	  Shannon Lee , the daughter of Bruce Lee , delivers high kicking martial arts action in spades in this exhilarating Hong Kong movie and proves that like her late brother Brandon she is a real chip off the old block . There is high tech stuntwork to die for in this fast paced flick and the makers of the Bond movies should give it a look if they want to spice up the action quotient of the next 007 adventure as there is much innovative stuff here with some fresh and original second unit work to bolster up the already high action content of " AND NOW , YOU 'RE DEAD " . When you watch a movie as fast paced and entertaining as this you begin to wonder how cinema itself was able to survive before the martial arts genre was created . I genuinely believe that movies in general and action movies in particular were just marking time until the first kung fu movies made their debut . Bruce Lee was the father of modern action cinema and his legitimate surviving offspring Shannon does not let the family name down here . Although there are several pleasing performances in this movie ( Michel Wong for one ) it is Shannon Lee whom you will remember for a genuinely spectacular performance as Mandy the hitgirl supreme . Hell ; you may well come away whistling her fights !  
0	  This is possibly the worst version of the play I have seen - several times on stage apart from the movie . A very nice idea for the set up - the American South can give a credible backdrop for the extreme reaction round Hero 's supposed misdemeanour . But the execution ! Widdoes is a very mannered Beatrice giving a particularly poor performance . Waterston , a fine actor , is not much better as Benedict . The poorest performance is in the role of Don John - it makes Keanu Reeves look good . Perhaps the desire to make it a caricature along the lines of the villain who ties the maiden to the train track fits with the keystone kops capers of Dogberry and his men - but the acting makes you want to cringe . Successful set-ups include the scene where they fool Benedict into believing Beatrice loves him - were the acting competent it would be superb . But the use of the river and the visual humour of Benedict moving closer is well produced . Overall I had to force myself to keep watching but it certainly didn't keep my attention . Very disappointing . With respect to latter comments above I am nearly 40 . I 've been watching stage and screen productions of Shakespeare for over 2 decades . Might I suggest when trying to defend your friends you speak to the piece rather than attack other reviewers when you are so inadequately armed in terms of fact . I can assume though , from your distaste regarding youth , that you are of sufficient age where the mannered acting of bygone days is more to your taste . My personal favourite pairing was Rylance and McTeer on the London stage . Unlike Widdoes , McTeer , a skilled and charismatic performer , can act .  
0	  I had some time to kill before watching football so I saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it I thought I had encountered my version of mentally walking the Bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the Mummy series and Jurassic Park . It was so bad that I thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup . The acting was so bad that I was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end . The lead by Casper Van Dien made me long for the high caliber acting of Steven Seagal in " On Deadly Ground " as his line reading was so wooden that Woody Woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder . I also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that I was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat . The direction was so abysmal I looked back yearning to my nephew 's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage . The FX of the movie was so bad that I thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade Z horror flicks from yesteryear . What Robert Wagner , Tom Bosley and Geoffrey Lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie . My warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your IQ to diminish with prolonged viewing . On a side note I noticed at IMDb that sometimes salaries for movies are published I was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies . Beware and be safe avoid at all costs .  
1	  I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old . Unfortunately I could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night . Now I bought it on DVD because I can remember that I liked it . This is really not an ordinary horror movie . It has some horror elements but I rather categorize it as fantasy . I liked it but I hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes . Especially the scene when Anna 's dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit short . Now to the plot . This movie is about a young girl named Anna who gets ill . While she is ill and has to lie in her bed because of her high fewer she turns on to finishing her drawing about a house - the paperhouse . When she fells a sleep , which often strangely happens just immediately , she finds herself near the house on a big green field . She realizes that the house is exactly like the one she has drawn and that every new detail also appears in her dreams . One day she draws a boy into the house to have somebody to talk to . As she forgets to draw his legs ( because he is sitting behind a window ) the boy cannot walk . Later she is being told by the doctor , that a boy also has this strange disease and she realizes that with the boy she has drawn , she also got that boy into her disturbing dreams . She also notices that it gets harder and harder for her to wake up from her dreams . As she misses her father who is ofter abroad she draws her father into the house . She makes a mistake and her father is looking very angry on the painting . She tries to rubber him out but realizes that she cannot change anything already drawn . And next time she falls asleep the horror begins . Her father is mad and blind ( because she draw s * on his head to mark him as ' invalid ' ) and tries to get into the paperhouse and kill Anna and his friend . Her dreams became a horrendous nightmare . They manage to escape and to kill her father and Anna can finally wake up . Than Anna finds her self in the hospital where her parents are sitting beside her bed . The doctors thought that she fell into a coma or so . They tell Anna that the other boy died and that they want to travel to the ocean to get over those tragical happenings . Anna draws a watchtower and notices that the same watchtower can be found near the hotel they traveled to . She runs to the watchtower and meets the boy ( I am just not mentioning his name because I cannot remember it and do not want to go back to the previous html page ) and can say good bye to him and forget those terrible dreams forever . There were a few thing I did not understand in the movie . First of all it was the ending which I absolutely dislike . I think it is too long while the main part of the movie becomes a bit too short . How does the boy fly a helicopter and speak to Anna as he is supposed to be dead ? Why did you have to put such a stupid radio on the wall ? I hated that scene it was so dumb to me . It almost ruined the main horror scene . Things I liked were the scene with the photograph of Anna 's dad which was the first real scary and horror scene . I liked the boy . The actor was awesome . He was even better than Anna . I also liked how Anna tries to get her father out of the painting while she is asleep and how she is looking for it in the garbage . Overall a good movie . I give it a 8 out of 10 .  
1	  This film deals with the atrocity in Derry 30 years ago which is commonly known as Bloody Sunday . The film is well researched , acted and directed . It is as close to the truth as we will get until the outcome of the Saville enquiry . The film puts the atrocity into context of the time . It also shows the savagery of the soldiers on the day of the atrocity . The disgraceful white-wash that was the Widgery Tribunal is also dealt with . Overall , this is an excellent drama which is moving and shocking . When the Saville report comes out , watch this film again to see how close to the truth it is .  
1	  I have just watched the whole 6 episodes on DVD . The acting throughout is excellent - no question . There was not quite enough action for me I must say . No real suspense as such , just plenty of first class character development . Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of " whodunnit " . If you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you . Peter Egan as the lead Magnus Pym is excellent . The film portrayed the life of a traitor . A man who should have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things . As a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time & time again as a crook and a con man . Pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him ( wife , son , mentor ) . Pym is fatally damaged by his father 's influence - it has eaten his moral fibre away . He has no real love or loyalty in him . Heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series . Very well done though .  
1	  I am a fan of animal movies . If you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over . Homeward Bound did just this . They took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it . It was a complete success . It is very much an archetypal movie . You have the obi-wan of the group ( shadow ) who is wise and logical , you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting Chance , and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised . These three personalities bounce off of each other very well . I also like how they made Chance and Sassy such dynamic characters , and they did not overdue it . Most people say that it cannot be good because it is too much of a kids film . What they are forgetting , however , is that it is supposed to be a kids film , and this still does not take away from the acual movie . This is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie . It is a Disney movie without the cartoons , an air bud movie with a better plot . I would , without a doubt , advise you to watch it .  
1	  Today actresses happily gain weight , dye their hair , dress like slobs , and lose their glamor for a role , and Bette Davis was probably the actress who started the trend . Even as a pretty young woman who occasionally wore designer clothes and Constance Bennett-type makeup in films , Davis was willing to ravage herself in order to create a character on the outside as well as the inside . Her determination is amply demonstrated here in her breakout film , " Of Human Bondage , " in which she stars with Leslie Howard as Philip Carey . Davis plays Mildred , a slutty , manipulative , greedy low-life to Howard 's masochistic , club-footed Philip . He first meets her when she 's a waitress , and she allows him to take her out to dinner and theater while she frolics with a wealthy older man ( Alan Hale Sr. ) . In truth , Mildred is repulsed by Philip 's club foot . On his part , Philip seems to enjoy the abuse of her open flirtation and her coolness toward him . He allows Mildred to bleed him dry financially in between boyfriends who drop her when they tire of her , while he blows off a couple of truly lovely women ( Kay Johnson and Frances Dee ) . When he gets the gumption to throw her out , Mildred trashes his apartment and robs him , forcing him to withdraw from medical school and lose his lodgings . " Of Human Bondage " looks rather stilted today in parts . Though Leslie Howard was a wonderful actor and attractive , his acting style is of a more formal old school , and as a result , he tends to date whatever he 's in . He shines in material like his role opposite Davis in " It 's Love I 'm After " or " The Petrified Forest " which call for his kind of technique . His dated acting is even more obvious here because Davis was forging new ground with a gritty , edgy performance that would really make her name . If she seems at times over the top , she came from the stage , and the subtleties of film acting would emerge later for her . Contrast this performance with the restraint , warmth and gentleness of her Henriette in " All This , and Heaven Too " or the pathos she brought to " Dark Victory . " She was a true actress and a true artist . Davis really allows herself to look like holy hell ; Mildred 's deterioration is absolutely pathetic as Philip seems to gain strength as her spirit fades . An excellent film in which to see the burgeoning of one of film 's greatest stars .  
0	  Those familiar with the two previous Cube films pretty much know what they can expect : a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of booby trapped rooms , paranoia , bad acting .. This one is a bit different though . Roughly half of the film takes place outside the cube , where we get to watch the people watching the people inside the cube ( or at least five of them ) . I guess Cube Zero aspires to explain what the deal with the cube is , but you really don't get to know much more than what was covered in the two first films . Sure , there 's sort of an explanation in there , but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first film . Cube Zero looks rather cheap ( as did its predecessors ) , and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling . I also fell pretty confident in saying that there 's no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the foreseeable future . They have brought back the traps from Cube 1 , though , ( by that I mean that they 're almost the same ones , which is a bit of a shame ) . I know that many people kind of appreciate this film and its ties with the first one , but I just feel that it 's a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that wasn't that great to begin with . [ 1/10 ]  
0	  There 's nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert wasteland , and Robot Wars does deliver . Sure , the acting is lousy , the dialogue is sub-par , and the characters are one-dimensional , but it has giant robots ! The special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period . They are certainly not as polished as today 's standards , but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses miniatures , so it has aged fairly well . Its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime , and it does have a certain tongue-in-cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable . I would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci-fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction .  
0	  Sometime in 1998 , Saban had acquired the rights to produce a brand-new Ninja Turtles live-action series . Naturally , being a fan of the TMNT back in the day , this obviously peaked my interest . So when I started watching the show .. to say I was disappointed by the end result is an understatement . Some time later ( more like recently ) , I got a chance to revisit the series . First off , let 's talk about some of the positives . They managed to re-create the Turtles ' lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this . There tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot . And the Turtle suits , while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot , were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series . People tend to complain about getting rid of Shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a Power Rangers show . But you can only have Shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain .. and besides , most fans don't realize or don't remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic , the Shredder was offed in the very first issue ! Never mind the countless resurrections that would follow . So on a personal standpoint , I was sort of glad they got rid of Shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode . I find that Shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the Turtles are all the more memorable . Unfortunately , they end up replacing him with these original villains who , as stated , seemed more fit for a Power Rangers show than a Ninja Turtles show . And with these new magic-wielding generics comes a new female magic-wielding turtle , the infamous Venus De Milo . I 'll be honest ; I never got comfortable with her . I 'm not against the idea of a female turtle ; I 'm just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain . I almost get the impression that this could have easily been the Venus De Milo show dealing with her make-believe enemies and the TMNT are just there to provide the star power ( or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released ) . Fortunately , they all share the spotlight together . Next Mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it . Given time and maybe another season , I really believe this live iteration of the TMNT could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness . But while the idea was sound , the execution was flawed ( although there are a couple good episodes in this series ) . As it stands , Next Mutation is one of those oddities in Turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten .  
1	  Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid . I used to borrow the books from the school library every chance I got . My favorite one was " The Red Sea Sharks " - so much action and humor . This documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of Herge and his development of Tintin . The film-maker 's personal experience in interviewing Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the Chan character was very moving . A great documentary of a very talented and well-loved artist . A great example of someone who has become internationally renown , and has brought joy of millions of children ( and the young at heart ) all over the world .  
0	  Oh man is this movie bad . It flows horribly . The story is about a race car driver who is in love with himself , and then has to promote a chicken fast food chain and while doing this , doesn't love himself . He tries getting out of the contract and horrible , painfully unfunny gags ensue . Jim Nabors seems as if he 's sleepwalking , not acting . You 'll miss such Burt sidekicks as Dom Deluise and Jerry Reed while watching this stinker . Loni Anderson 's hair is downright scary , proving that tons of hairspray didn't go out in the sixties . Or maybe that was a wig . Speaking of , Burt 's wig wasn't bad in this film . His worst " wig day " was in " Smokey and the Bandit 2 " . Anyhow , this movie is the worst Reynolds car movie , ever , ever , right up there with " Cannonball Run 2 " . The original " Smokey " and " Cannonball " ( and " Hooper " which , thankfully , had no sequel ) are great , funny films . This one isn't . Even Ned Beatty , who is a great actor , stinks . You 'll long for a Jackie Gleason type villain who is fun to hate . And mind you , this isn't one of those fun movies to bag on . It 's lousy , pure and simple . Even the outtakes at the end were tiresome and boring , and worst of all , unfunny . And least I forget , " Stroker Ace " was one of the first heavy nails to seal Burt 's coffin before his somewhat-revival years later in " Boogie Nights " , another film that , like " Deliverance " years earlier , shows that the man can act quite good when he has a decent platform to do so .  
1	  I enjoyed the film and would suggest to anyone just out for a good time . Don't take the film all too seriously because remember it 's Disney and it 's rated G. It 's good clean fun although some parts may be recognised by adults but children would never notice , particularly the " triangle " between Cruella , Le Pelt , and Cruella 's faithful valet Alonso . Glenn Close is fantastic and really has made Cruella her own and is believably terrifying even when she is " cured " of her fur loving ways , she can instill fear in the audience with her shrills that literally shake the theater . ( I even found myself jumping in my seat when she catches you by surprise with her ' bipolarity ' as the dog loving Ella . ) All in all I will go see it again in theaters , I found myself enjoying it so much .  
0	  Ok , I like B movies .. I know what B movies are supposed to represent . But this is just awful . I am amazed it got such a decent overall score . The only redeeming qualities of this flick are the ( mostly ) marginal splatter effects . Don't get me wrong , gore abounds in this flick - but few effects really jumped out at me ( like the anal " probe " .. that was great ! ) . I believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder . C'mon - rent a Betacam at least , I 've seen porn with better production values ( and better acting as well ) . Acting - sucked ! But not in the Troma or Full Moon sort of way . Story - contrived ! But thats what you get from films like these . Very loose ! Sets & Props - sucked ! My 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on Halloween . Dubbing and dialogue - sucked ! Horrible voice acting ( I shouldn't even call it acting ) and every other word is " S * t " or " F * k " . There are tons of good classic and B rated horror / splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track down . Do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this crap !  
1	  The film had many fundamental values of family and love . It expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story . The script was clear ( it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children ) and was enjoyable and humorous at times . There were a few charged symbols to look for . The cinematography was acceptable . There was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today ( which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out ) . It was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it . Although editing could have been done better I thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy . And the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something I didn't like either but in all it was a good movie .  
1	  Good : Engaging cinematic firefights , great presentation , vehicles are actually fun to drive , fairly appealing multiplayer , faithful to the movie , and the list goes on . Bad : Main missions are a bit short . This game defines what a " good " third person shooter ( not necessarily a spy-game ) is . Great firefights carry on the story and make you want to complete EVERY single mission through , and unlock all the genuine bonuses the game has to offer . The hype this game had , was lived up to , and I personally think you should buy it , and hook up with a couple of friends and play this one . Loads of fun . The sound in this game , is a rip-roaring achievement from a few previous bond games , and firing a weapon , really feels like you 're firing a weapon . It ties in with the aspect that you are a deadly and ruthless spy . All in all , this game makes you excited and satisfied after you make it through , and some multiplayer that can compete with the standards of the crafty James Bond " Nightfire " game for gamecube .  
0	  If Edward Woodward was the the flicks watching this film then that 's what he would scream out in horror . I 'm sorry folks but enough 's enough . We had Get Carter , The Italian Job , Alfie and now this . What 's the similarities ? No . It 's not exactly a coincidence that three of the originals star Maurice Micklewhite and the other stars another great British actor . The main common ingredient in those originals IS the britishness of the films . They weren't made to impress Hollywood . They were quirky English films with a unique charm / atmosphere that just cannot be replicated in the USA . The word is CULT and what better way to destroy a cult film than to bastardise it with a remake or even a sequel . Wicker 06 had a tough task before it even hit the road . Wicker 73 is even more enigmatic that other said cult films ; it defies genre , intelligent scripts , A-grade actors , the music score , set-pieces that defy description and all the stories surrounding the film . So here comes a remake . Don't worry . No originals were harmed in the making of this remake . Some major aspects of the story needed to be reworked for the modern USA - communications , paganism , virgins . But that 's just about the whole premise . So we give the cop a Nam style trauma past complete with shock music flashbacks for the cheap scares . Then with no mobile phone mast on the island that sorts the communication out - but in the real world this wouldn't happen . Cops just don't go missing . Give him a blood link for motivation rather than the clash of beliefs and you have the remake . Wafer thin though , isn't it ? It 's just that it was all laid on with a trowel . The name alterations were simply hammy , almost Carry On , there was no sense of community on the island , no centre of town to catch your bearings , just a few houses dotted about a forest and that was it . Willow was just annoying by not giving out any info at all and Cage was useless to let her get away with it . When he went into the well you just knew he would get locked it . The screenplay was signposted all the way to the end - and you just wanted it to hurry up and end . The epilogue was absolutely hilarious and didn't know when to stop . That ending is probably the best way to summarise the difference between the two . One ends in the most beautiful sunset after the most horrific day . The other ends with a post-production explain it all to the thickies type conclusion . I loved the original but went to the cinema with an open mind and was excited to see the film . I left thankful in the knowledge that this film will probably end up beneath a highway somewhere only this time mercifully forgotten forever .  
1	  Engaging , riveting tale of captured US army turncoat who has to prove his innocence to avoid the hangman . Paul Ryker dodges friendly fire in a seemingly doomed attempt to convince a military court that he was actually a US spy on a secret mission in Korea . In the vein of classic courtroom dramas , " Sergeant Ryker " is an extremely well crafted mystery , ably guided by an outstanding cast , director Kulik 's constant momentum , and effective plot twists and turns . This film was originally made as a television movie in 1964 , and subsequently beefed up for this revision with the presence of many " name " actors , and some action sequences . Dillman , reprising his role , is spot-on as the doubting defence attorney , whose attentions sometimes stray to the personal plight of Ryker 's supportive , yet somewhat distant wife , played with aplomb by Vera Miles . Rounding out the frontline is Peter Graves for the prosecution , and Norman Fell and Murray Hamilton in key supporting roles . Marvin 's interpretation of the Paul Ryker character is a balanced depiction of a simple but dedicated man whose normally laid back demeanour is challenged by the desperate circumstances in which he 's placed . Marvin switches perfectly from resigned indifference , to passionate determination , giving a convincing , often intense performance that is the highlight of this otherwise small-scale drama . It 's this performance that should elevate the film to a platform where it occupies a place on the best-ever lists of courtroom dramas . However , despite its apparent obscurity , " Sergeant Ryker " still remains a taut and compelling examination , like a book that you just can't put down . Highly recommended .  
1	  In his otherwise excellent book , Lincoln in American Memory , the historian Merrill Peterson calls Young Mr. Lincoln a " boring , dreadful , film " . This amazingly wrongheaded analysis simply proves that great historians are rarely fine film critics . I am working on a doctoral dissertation on Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass . As part of my preparation for writing the dissertation , I made a careful analysis of this film , and of Tag Gallaghers brilliant interpretation of it in his seminal book on Ford . Young Mr. Lincoln comes out that culminating year of the first phase of Ford 's cinematic authorship , 1939 . In that greatest of Hollywood years , Ford directed three superb , still not fully appreciated films : Drums Along the Mohawk , Stagecoach , and Young Mr. Lincoln . It might seem odd to say that Stagecoach is not fully appreciated , all but the most purblind of critics must perceive that it is one of of the greatest Westerns , and perhaps even one of the hundred greatest films of all time . However , what is NOT fully appreciated is that these three films work together as a kind of trilogy-a triptych , in fact . Ford is creating a sort of mythic history of America on screen . Drums Along the Mohawk is the Revolutionary War . Young Mr. Lincoln is pre-Civil War America . Finally , Stagecoach is Post Civil War America . What the three films have in common is that they are an extended meditation on the American Adam and his " errand into the Wilderness " . What are the Psychic and social costs of American manifest destiny , as America strives to build a new human city in the wilderness ? Lincoln symbolizes Americas journey , as he seeks to reconcile the civilizational inmpulse ( law ) , with the freedom of the wilderness . Young Mr. Lincoln is not history , ( It is full of historical " howlers'-as both Ford and Trotti were well aware ) , but myth . This is Lincoln , the symbol of justice and mercy , Lincoln , the man of the wilderness , striving to found a civilization within himself , and to become the " remarkable lawgiver ' of young America . Young Mr. Lincoln is not history-like James Agee 's long forgotten teleplay about Lincoln , and like Sandburgs biography , it is an epic poem .. a very beautiful epic poem .  
0	  It doesn't take long to see why Code Name : Diamond Head didn't make it onto the network schedules . The TV pilot movie doesn't get past the credits before it 's obvious just how bad it 's going to be . Maybe I missed something , because the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense . Based on what I got out of the muddled mess , a terrorist or thief or something named " Tree " ( Ian McShane ) goes to Hawaii to steal something to do with a secret weapon . The world 's dullest secret agent , Johnny Paul ( Roy Thinnes ) , is out to stop him . There might have been more , but trust me  it really doesn't matter anyway . Action movies should have action . Suspenseful moments should have suspense . And dramatic moments should have drama . There 's none of that in Code Name : Diamond Head . I 've seen others use the word " turgid " to describe this made for TV snoozer  and it 's better than any one word description I can come up with . None of the characters is in the least bit exciting or worth caring about . And Roy Thinnes makes for the worst leads imaginable . His charisma is just slightly north of a slug . Ian McShane is easily the best thing the movie has going for it , but unfortunately for everyone else involved , it doesn't appear he was going to be back as a regular cast member . Now if McShane had been cast in the series lead , well then you might have had something . I 'm quickly discovering that these Gawd awful 70s made-for-TV movies make great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes . And that goes double if Quinn Martin was involved . Very funny stuff from Mike and the Bots . So while I may only give the movie a 3/10 , I rate Episode # 608 a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale .  
1	  CHANCES ARE is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman ( Cybill Shepherd ) whose husband ( Christopher McDonald ) is killed shortly after learning she is pregnant . We then see the husband in heaven letting the powers that be know that he was taken too soon and that his wife needs him . He is told he can return to earth but not as himself . Flashforward 19 years where we see Shepherd 's daughter ( Mary Stuart Masterson ) preparing to graduate from college and encountering a young man ( Robert Downey Jr. ) who , it turns out is the reincarnation of her father . The film is a little on the predictable side .. the story goes all the places you expect it to , but it is so charmingly played by an energetic cast ( especially Shepherd and Downey ) that you can't help but get wrapped up in the fun . Shepherd has rarely been seen on screen to better advantage and she and Downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles . A lovely and charming fantasy that will engulf and enchant you .  
0	  Actually had to stop it . Don't get me wrong , love bad monster movies . But this one was way too boring , regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere . The actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts , was way too obvious a cliché . This film totally betrays the cover on the DVD which looks pretty interesting . From the cover one expects a giant monster , but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels . Moved on to watch another film called The Killer Rats but that 's another review . Deep Shock was really crap , a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget .  
0	  This film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes . The problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking ( through the jungle , up a rocky cliff , near a river or lake ) to pad out the running time . The film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging , bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb . Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad English dubbing , gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras . For a zombie / cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then I probably didn't see an uncut version .  
1	  This game is amazing . Really , you should get it if you don't have it . Although it is ancient now it was amazing when it came out . I believe that this game will always be a classic . It 's just as good a Super Mario World or so . When I was young , my friend and I would sit and play this game for hours trying to beat it which we eventually did . It 's not nearly as advanced as Super Mario Galaxy , but if you are a fellow Mario fan it is essential . It 's fun entertaining and challenging . Everything you could want out of a fantasy game except for good graphics , ( well it did come out in 1996 . ) ROCK ON 4EVA MARIO LUIGI AND YOSHI ! Nintendo is the best !  
1	  " Citizen X " is the superbly told true story of the hunt for one of history 's worst serial killers . What makes this story even more compelling is where and when it took place ; the Soviet Union in the 1980 's . * Mild Spoilers * Viktor Burakov ( magnificently played by Stephen Rea ) is a newly promoted forensic investigator for the Rostov oblast militia . He discovers past and present unsolved murders , apparently by the same person . The murders are unsolved because no one has ever taken the trouble to properly investigate the evidence . He is driven to find and stop the killer . His only tools are his dedication , skill and honesty . His obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the Soviet system that discourages the search for truth . His naiveté would have led to failure were it not for his boss , Col . Mikhail Fetisov ( Donald Sutherland ) . Fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with the Soviet bureaucracy . However , he also shares Burakov 's desire to bring a murderer to justice , even if the official party line is " There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union ! " The cast is outstanding . The locations and sets are perfect recreations of latter day Soviet life . Randy Edelman 's score is particularly good . More important , this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with both intensity and poignancy . This was a made-for-cable movie by HBO Films and they have become a great resource for films that would otherwise never be made .  
0	  FLIGHT OF FURY takes the mantle of being the very WORST Steven Seagal flick I 've ever seen .. Up to now . It 's a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest , Seagal isn't really trying in this - he 's fat and his voice is dubbed once more . The Co-stars fare no better , being a rather sorry load of 3rd raters . The Direction by Keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he 's also responsible for another couple of Seagal stinkers ( SHADOW MAN & ATTACK FORCE ) The screenplay Co-written by Seagal himself is laughably inept . According to IMDb $ 12M was spent on this boring load of old tosh - If these figures are correct I sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spent . FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a shot for shot remake of the Michael Dudikoff flick BLACK THUNDER - which has to be better than this tripe . This has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever , Give it a MISS ! 1/2 * out of *  
0	  Up until this new season I have been a big ' Little Mosque ' fan . However , the new season had absolutely RUINED it . The new Christian vicar has destroyed the entire intent of the show . It has always been about living together to overcome prejudice . The new vicar ruins that premise and shows Christians in a very bad light . I am neither Christian or Muslim , but loved watching the show and seeing the camaraderie between Amar and the Reverend . Not any more . Just cancel it and be done with it . It 's not worth watching any more . It might still be saved , but a lot of change would need to be made . Bring back the old format .  
0	  I´m not surprised that even cowgirls get the blues if this movie is anything to go by . I expected something better from Uma Thurman , which was the reason I suffered my way through this experience in the first place . An awful film with only the music as a redeeming quality . It´s just a shame that we are incapable of giving 0 out of 10 in these reviews . This movie deserves it .  
0	  Scotty ( Grant Cramer , who would go on to star in the great B-movie " Killer Klowns from outer space " ) agrees to help three middle-aged guys learn how to ' dialog ' the ladies in this bad ' 80 's comedy . Not bad as in ' 80 's lingo , which meant good . Bad as in bad . With no likable characters , including , but not limited to , a kid who 's the freakiest looking guy since " Friday the 13th part 2 " ' a girl who leads men on and then goes into hissy fits when they want to touch her , and the token fat slob , because after all what would an ' 80 's sex comedy be without a fat slob ? Well this one has two . This movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of ' 80 's sex comedies . And then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrel . My Grade :D - Eye Candy : too numerous to count , you even see the freaky looking kid imagined with boobs at on point , think " Bachlor Party " but not as funny , and VERY disturbing . Where I saw it : Comcast Moviepass  
1	  BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU 'RE DEAD starts off promisingly , setting up a simple heist that goes awry , told from varying perspectives ( in RASHOMON style ) . At around the hour mark , Sidney Lumet transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts ; it eventually morphs into a multi-faceted family drama , exploring the full realm of human emotions / relations , as the story comes to its chilling climax . As is the case with Lumet , he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his star-studded cast , without any notion of over-acting or hyperbole . Philip Seymour Hoffman , in one of his best roles , is a complex , mysterious , and interesting character , and oftentimes dwarfs Ethan Hawke , who plays his brother , Hank . That 's not to say that Hawke is not bad ; in fact he is quite above adequate , in a troubled role that suits his style . Marisa Tomei is excellent for her relatively short appearance ( the fact that she bares her flesh adds to this ) . Albert Finney 's character ( Andy and Hank 's father ) is the most intriguing , and in my opinion , he deserved a bit more screen-time . Amy Ryan also performs her job adequately . BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU 'RE DEAD is not an exceptional movie , but it proves that Lumet is still near the top of his game at the ( apparent ) twilight of an illustrious career . Many of his characteristics and trademarks appear here , not least of which involves the use of his characters . Infused with a killer script ( no pun intended ) , smart dialogue and pacing , and a decent score , BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU 'RE DEAD is a must-see . A truly underrated gem . 8/10 . 3 stars ( out of 4 ) . Should just enter my Top 250 at 248 . Highly recommended .  
0	  I have only recently been able to catch up with the films of Marilyn Miller since they are not shown on TCM in the UK.I have been much intrigued over the years because this was one of the superstars of the 20s . What was she really like . To some stars of this era like Jolson some of the magic still shines through , but alas not for Miller . Her dancing seems awkward and poorly choreographed , her singing somewhat limited and as an actress she makes Ruby Keeler seem like Hepburn . Even worse in this film as the public had grown tired of musicals virtually all of the musical numbers have been deleted . So we are left with a comedy of that period with little real appeal . She was being paid $ 500000 for this ! So i have only two conclusion . Either she was poorly served by the cinema or she had no talent at all . I think that the truth is nearer the later than the former .  
1	  Anton Newcombe and Courtney Taylor are friends , they both are the leads in their own respective bands ; Anton with The Brian Jonestown Massacre and Courtney with The Dandy Warhols . What 's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals ; its a love hate relationship . At times you both hear them praising one another , but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are . While the Dandy Warhols went on the reach commercial success , BJM still was stuck in the underground scene ; and for good reason why . The focus of Dig ! is more towards Anton and the BJM , as they have a lot more substance . They are the most dysfunctional band . During gigs they will fight and bash each other . Anton will hit other members if he feels they aren't performing correctly . With the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume , fight was always waiting to happen . You know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens ; that 's why people would go to their gigs , for the fights . Anton is very unstable . Always thinking himself as a music messiah , he wants to change music and create a revolution , but he could never get out of the underground . He is a very talented musician , its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill . But his draw back is he cant escape the world he created ; a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs , alcohol and depression . On the other side , the Dandy Warhols were having their own troubles . They didn't find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label . But they found huge success in Europe . But Courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of Anton . Its interesting that both Anton and Courtney both had what the other needed . Courtney always wanted to be musically talented as Anton , though Anton wouldn't say it , he needed the commercial success that the Dandy 's had , to make his revolution . Over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands , there is a lot of footage . There is never a dull moment in Dig ! . It is constantly moving along as it doesn't have time to slow down as it has to much to say , seven years of story telling in the 1h 45mins is a hard job . Ondi Timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more . Even if you don't like the bands it still deserves viewing ; it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure . You wont be disappointed .

1	  I saw this when it premiered and just re-watched it on IFC again . This is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant farmworker population that came to Hawai'i to work the sugar plantations in the early 1900 's . My grandparents were part of that migration ; my parents were born on a Kohala plantation ( Big Island ) at the time setting of the movie . I moved to the Big Island over a year ago after living in California for over 30 years . I was surprised to see that many of the former cane growing lands are still undeveloped , with wild cane still growing , years after the plantations closed . I 've heard many stories from my aunts and uncles who were kids growing up on the plantation . This movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories . This story is more of an historical document than a romantic plot-driven movie . It leaves me shaking my head to read a review like ccthemovieman 's . Some people just don't get it . I didn't recall that Youki Kudoh had the starring role , with which she did an incredible job . I recall her great performances in Jim Jarmusch 's " Mystery Train " and in an Australian film , co - starring with Russell Crowe , " Heaven 's Burning " . Tamlyn Tomita did a great job with her pidgin English , especially for someone who didn't grow up in the Islands . I had forgotten that Toshiro Mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator . And I missed the fact that Jason Scott Lee had an uncredited , non-speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene . I was saddened to find out that the director and co-writer , Kayo Hatta , died in an accidental drowning in 2005 . There are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience : " Gaijin " about the immigrant cane workers in Brazil ( many of them Japanese ) in the same time period ; and " Sugar Cane Alley " about the cane plantation experience in Africa . The latter is still available , but " Gaijin " , sadly , doesn't appear to have been shown in quite a while . Another great film about the early Asian in America experience when immigrants were more like slaves is " A Thousand Pieces of Gold " . This was set over the Chinese workers ' involvement in the building of the railroad , starred Rosalind Chao , Chris Cooper , Michael Paul Chan , and Dennis Dun .  
0	  From the nepotism capitol of the world comes another junk flick in a fancy wrapper . " CQ " tells a lame , disjointed mess of a story which is little more than a bunch of silly caricatures , a babe , and straight man Davies running around trying to make a stupid sci-fi flick . I can't think of any reason anyone would want to spend time with this ridiculous attempt at film making . ( D )  
0	  As an ex-teacher ( ! ) I must confess to cringing through many scenes - ' though I continued to watch to the end . I wonder why ? ! ( Boredom , perhaps ? ) :-) The initial opening scenes struck me as incredibly mish-mashed and unfocussed . The plot , too , although there were some good ideas - the plight of a relief teacher , for example - were not concentrated enough in any one direction for 3-D development . Not one of Mr Nolte 's finer moments . As to young Mr Macchio , does he speak that way in * every * movie ? Plot and acting complaints aside , the hair-styles alone were a nostalgic ( if nauseating ) trip .  
0	  When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies , I thought it was too harsh but little did I know that the low rating was absolutely correct . I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers . I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks . Little Man , however , had very few laughs and the jokes were stale . Obviously , the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans , who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison . He and his partner , Tracy Morgan , steal a diamond meant for a gangster . Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington . In order to get the diamond back , the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep . Of course , he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond . The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour . All these talents , however , cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny . The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was OK . I mean , it was not 100 % believable but it was OK .. nothing great . I just wish that the Wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses . Wait for it on cable or television . It really is not worth any amount of money .  
0	  Entrails of a Virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively , applying whatever meaning he wishes to its inexplicable excesses of sex and violence . If this was an intentional characteristic of the film , it would be a work of postmodern brilliance-but of course it isn't . Without getting too much into plot summary , let 's take a quick walking tour of the events . At a secluded cabin , an orgy is in progress , which includes topless wrestling and diaper p * ing . A vanload of latecomers joins the orgy in progress , but they have unwittingly been followed by a monster I like to call " the muddy ninja . " This monster precedes to slay orgy participants one by one , except the proverbial virgin ( if you don't count oral sex ) who receives his seed and consequently becomes so passionate with desire that she masturbates with someone 's severed hand . Finally she has her guts pulled out , and then there 's a scene which seems to imply that she 's pregnant with a baby muddy ninja . Got all that ? If you 're going to rent this movie , it 's best if you don't speak Japanese and don't have any subtitles . In a season populated by boring Hollywood flicks , putting this in your VCR might be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy . It will certainly be something different .  
0	  The animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds , and looks more like caricatures rather than characters . I 've been a fan of Scooby Doo ever since the series premiered in 1969 . I didn't think much of the Scooby Doo animated movies , ( I 'm talking about the TV Series , not the full length movies . ) , but some of them were pretty cool , and I like most people found Scrappy Doo to be an irritant , but this series is pure garbage . As soon as I saw the animation , and heard the characters , ( and I use that term loosely ) speak , I cringed . Also , Mystery Inc . , was a team , and without the entire crew to compliment each other , it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones , and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants . What 's New Scooby Doo was better than this . If you 're going to have a Scooby Doo TV series , include the elements that made the series endure so long . The entire cast of characters , and quality animation . They need to put this one back under the rock from where it came .  
1	  A very strange and compelling movie . It 's about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door-to-door fundraiser / salesman . The director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well . Original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life . There is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something I do as frequently as I should . One of the more memorable films I 've seen in a long while . Hasn't left my mind and I look forward to future efforts by Bronstein . Fantastic performances all around . The simple line " I really appreciate it . " is now iconic to me .  
1	  In the year 1985 ( my birth year ) Steven Spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young African-American girl Celie ( Debut role for Whoopi Goldberg ) whose life is followed through rough times . The story begins from the year 1909 when Celie is only 14 years old . She has given birth two children for her father . Celie has a younger sister Nettie with whom she is inseparable . A widower lays his eyes on Nettie but their father gives Celie to him . It is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling . Women are inferior of men and especially being an African-American woman their rights are less than a zero . Celie 's story is a true survival story . " The Color Purple " is a master-piece and underestimated film of Spielberg . He should make more drama which " The Color Purple " and " Schindler 's List " are good notion . The cast is amazing . Whoopi Goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as Celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama . Danny Glover was surprisingly nasty " Mister " . I have never seen him in a such an evil role . The talk-show icon Oprah Winfrey is brilliant as a strong-willed Sofia . Warning ! Prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film . You can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood . Especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like I have with my sister . Big applauds to Mr. Spielberg !  
0	  This film was horrible . The script is COMPLETELY unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real-world , the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film school . I do not recommend this film to anyone who : A ) knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations . B ) knows any detail about film making or appreciation . I do recommend this film to the average or below-average mind , I think it would be enjoyable if I was a dumber . If you must watch this film on a full mind , I highly recommend some kind of inebriation It is a total waste of what little production value it has .  
0	  I did not really want to watch this one . It seemed to be an old Raj Kanwar movie which disgusted me even before I started watching it because I don't consider him even close to being mediocre as a filmmaker . The only reason I took this one is obviously the Shahrukh Khan appearance in the film . I had not even known what the film was all about because I was sure it would be just an ordinary fairy tale . So I just imagined a love story between Shahrukh Khan and Divya Bharti with a substantial supporting role by Rishi Kapoor who I thought would be playing her father or uncle . And to my complete shock , Rishi Kapoor is actually the hero ! He is the one who romances the young Divya ! I was saddened to find out that Shahrukh had a small part of no substance and that too , only in the second part of this idiotic film . Just let me repeat the question : why would a 17 year-old lovely Divya have fallen for a 40-plus long haired , chubby , swollen piglet like Rishi Kapoor ? Rishi Kapoor should be ashamed of taking this part ; the only thing he did is ridiculing himself . He romanced a girl who could logically be younger than his own daughter and to make things worse - acts like a teenager at his forties . On top of that , just to make himself more pathetic , he plays a pop-star .. To make things clear , I have no problems with actors romancing ladies much younger than they themselves are . As long as they make a convincing couple , there should be no problem . In fact , leading actors have always been cast opposite young girls ( Amitabh Bachchan-Sridevi , Mithun Chakraborty-Madhuri Dixit , Shahrukh Khan-Deepika , Salman Khan-Sneha Ullal ) and made the pairing pretty well . Also , I have nothing against Rishi Kapoor , I think he is a good actor , and his act in Bobby is still well-engraved in my heart , but it 's not that he looks in this film like , say , Shahrukh Khan , Salman Khan or Aamir Khan look today . That was such a disappointment . Oh , and as for the reason every person actually watched this film , Shahrukh Khan made a good debut . He excelled in the very little his part allowed him to do . The late Divya Bharti made a promising debut as well . If you want to watch this film , go for the second half only . Personally , I would not do even that .  
1	  I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival . Not as salacious as it sounds , this is a three-part documentary ( each episode is 50 minutes ) featuring Slovenian superstar philosopher / psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek . Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films , exploring themes of sexuality , fantasy , morality and mortality . It was directed by Sophie Fiennes , of the multi-talented Fiennes clan ( she 's sister to actors Ralph and Joseph ) . I enjoyed this quite a bit , although I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD , since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested . Freudian and Lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours . It didn't help that an ill-advised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or so . My only real issue with this is that Zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with Freudian themes . He spends quite a bit of time on the films of Hitchcock and David Lynch , not exactly masters of subtlety . I would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films , although that 's really just me saying I 'd like to see part four and five and six . Zizek is very funny , and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films he 's discussing . So , for instance , we see him in a motorboat on his way to Bodega Bay ( from Hitchcock 's The Birds ) or sitting in the basement of the Bates Motel ( from Psycho ) . Which is not to say that his theories are not provocative . Even when I found myself disagreeing with him , it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films . Which is exactly what he 's trying to accomplish .  
1	  That is no criticism of the film , but rather a comment on how blind we are to our own past . I recently watched Winter Soldier , and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or sequel - except it was about Iraq rather than Vietnam . Similar to Winter Soldier because of it 's one-sided message , both films illustrate how gleefully we rush to engage in conflicts based on false pretenses , and allow our young and brave ( and often naive ) to bear the brunt of this greedy war profiteering . Both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the minds of the young and willing make them efficient killing machines , but the training falls woefully short of teaching the diplomatic and policing skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people they 're supposedly fighting for . This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam , and will likely lose the war in Iraq as well . My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided it could be easily passed off as left - wing propaganda . Not by me , mind you , but by those aiming to discredit the film and message . A more balanced point of view would speak to a larger audience .  
0	  Film version of Sandra Bernhard 's one-woman off-Broadway show is gaspingly pretentious . Sandra spoofs lounge acts and superstars , but her sense of irony is only fitfully interesting , and fitfully funny . Her fans will say she 's scathingly honest , and that may be true . But she 's also shrill , with an unapologetic , in-your-face bravado that isn't well-suited to a film in this genre . She doesn't want to make nice-and she 's certainly not out to make friends-and that 's always going to rub a lot of people the wrong way . But even if you meet her halfway , her material here is seriously lacking . Filmmaker Nicolas Roeg served as executive producer and , though not directed by him , the film does have his chilly , detached signature style all over it . Bernhard co-wrote the show with director John Boskovich ; their oddest touch was in having all of Sandra 's in-house audiences looking completely bored-a feeling many real viewers will most likely share . * 1/2 from *  
0	  The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its conceit that if one becomes a saint , he or she and his or her family and his or her significant other live forever . Let 's forget that in order to become a saint , the saint must be dead , and saints don't have significant others . That , for a millennium , Nick has been the Jolly Elf to Fred 's Scrooge is never even hinted at ! Open on Nick learning how to make toys , then on Fred learning how to run numbers ; Nick giving a sick child a dolly , Fred repossessing the dolly , along with the family farm ! After a few more such episodes , morph to present-day Fred venting his spleen at Siblings Anonymous as his fellow losers nod in empathy . There , I just wrote a more cohesive storyline than this idiocy ! This Santa , who is one " ho , ho , ho , ho , ho " away from a massive coronary , is a neurotic wuss saddled with the Queen of the Harpies , an operation straight out of Mega-Mall Hell , and answers to a Board ( huh ? ) which just gave the Easter Bunny his pink egg . Oh , and his right-hand man is a ditzy blonde in a skin-tight mini-dress and go-go boots . Ho .. ho .. ho .. ho .. ho ! But what really sent me over the edge was Slam being named # 1 on the Naughty List . Shouldn't a Naughty List be reserved for the future Hitlers and Stalins ? Children who are the true embodiments of evil ? Nope , to Old Sausage-Fingers , a good boy who lashes out because he is unwanted and unloved is the Demon Seed ! The nimrods behind Fred Claus should be boiled in their own pudding ! Bah !  
0	  Set in Providence , Rhode Island , Feeding the Masses tries to be a satiric look at the role of the media in government . At best , it could be applied to how the US try to control media during the Iraq War , but it ends up feeling hollow . There 's never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good . Worst , the direction of the movie is atrocious , focus more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond " Isn't this an odd way to hold the camera . " Special effects are pretty bad .. at one point video of an explosion is green screened over the city , and it 's laughable at best . The film does have a couple bright spots .. namely the advertisements for post-zombie services ( including a reclamation service and a party bus ) . But it 's far too little to make the film worthwhile . For a better zombie film , try Hide and Creep . It has the same weak production value , but there 's much more wit , humor and talent behind it .  
0	  When In Rome is a definite improvement on Getting There . Getting There I found too predictable , contrived and slow , and to this day I still consider it as the Olsen twins ' worst . However , while When In Rome isn't a terrible movie , it 's not a great one either . If I had to sum it up in one word , I would say passable . It is good fun for teenagers , but I think adults won't find much to go on . When In Rome does have its good points . Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are actually quite decent actresses , certainly very pretty as well . I will admit when I was 10 or so , I really liked them , and in general I kind of like them still . And I have enjoyed some of their movies like Passport To Paris and New York Minute . Back on target , both girls don't do that bad a job , in fact they are very appealing . Plus their outfits are to die for , and the scenery of Rome is absolutely breathtaking . The soundtrack ain't half bad either . However , where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script . The script is on the most part clichéd and has hints of deja vu . The plot , like most of the Mary Kate and Ashley movies , is very predictable , and anyone familiar with any other of the Olsen twins ' work , will find some rather unoriginal elements to it . Most of the characters are cardboard thin , and you don't learn very much about them , and sometimes the pace is uneven . Sadly , the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work , that looked rushed constantly . All in all , does have its good points , and certainly watchable . However , for my taste , it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff . 4/10 Bethany Cox  
0	  .. that Jamie Foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful , Oscar-winning performance . One of the reasons why I was so impressed with Foxx 's performance in " Ray " was because from watching his hammy , obnoxious acting in movies like " Bait " and " Booty Call , " I would never imagine he would ever hold the Oscar . If people told me five years ago that Jamie Foxx was one day going to win an Oscar , I would laugh right in their faces . Who knows ? Maybe he 's better off sticking to drama , because if you watch " Bait , " it 's clearly evident that comedy is not his forte . I swear , Jamie mugs so much in this movie that I 'm surprised his face didn't fall off . And why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets ? Anyone familiar with comedians like Bob Newhart and Steven Wright knows that doing comedy doesn't require being loud and obnoxious . If a joke is funny , it 's funny . If it 's not funny , then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier . The problem I have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character . In real life , normal people don't always have witty comebacks and quips . Like Albert Brooks said in an interview discussing his character in " Taxi Driver , " it 's important to be funny as your character , rather than be funny as a comedian . A prime example of Jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken , and he starts posing for the photographs like a model . If a regular person were being thrown in jail , would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken ? And wouldn't the police try to scold him if he was ? There are many scenes like that throughout the film . Another awful sequence is one where Jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain , and he starts doing a phony Caribbean accent . Not funny ! Not to mention Jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke . Giving a comedic performance requires patience , whereas he goes straight to the punchline , whether it 's the right time for it or not . I 'm not even a big Mike Epps fan , but even his performance is good in comparison to Jamie 's . As a matter of fact , this is the first time I felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen . Epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy , but at least he chooses a more low-key approach . One of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is David Morse , a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains . He seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality . However , fellow " Green Mile " star Doug Hutchison is disgustingly over-the-top as the villain . A big surprise , considering he gave a superb performance in " The Green Mile , " also playing a heavy . Antoine Fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like " The Replacement Killers " and " Training Day . " Even in " Bait , " he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence . His only problem seemed to be in disciplining Jamie Foxx , who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another . Unless you 're a die-hard fan of Foxx , please don't take the bait .  
0	  Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the U.S. President , i 'll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for , and this film shows us why . He teams up with a persistent news reporter ( Angie Harmon ) to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the president 's death , and so on , blah , blah , blah . Even with a cast of James Woods , Cuba Gooding Jr , Anne Archer and Angie Harmon ' End Game ' fails to grab your attention , plain and simple ; some of the action is good , the acting isn't all bad and the story although clichéd and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie - WELL IT DOESN'T ! The writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that , at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the characters . 4/10 It 's Boring , Predictable and Dull .  
0	  Camp Blood II is a vast improvement on Camp Blood II as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot . This time they 've ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness . This time around there 's a reality TV show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants . This is hardly a new idea , I 've seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knife . Unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs . I liked how there 's a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantom . I don't know why anyone would want to make a third Camp Blood film , I would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one . The half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me , it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for $ 5 just like they did in the second movie . They still haven't worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well , it 's a Camp Blood movie what do you expect ? If you like crap films you 'll get some fun out of this one .  
0	  It is hard to make an unbiased judgment on a film like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age . This is with out a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film . I was unfortunate enough to see this film for the first time in my youth , Iwill never forget it . I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made . I then saw it again earlier this year and was once again horrified . I am not a zealot or one to say what others should and should not see but I did take great offense to the way in which something as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie . I love lowbrow cinema but this is just plain nasty . Rent some Rus Myer instead .  
0	  As I sat in front of the TV watching this movie , I thought , " Oh , what Alfred Hitchcock , or even Brian DePalma , could have done with this ! " Chances are , you will too . It does start out intrigueing . A British park ranger living in Los Angeles ( Collin Firth ) marries a pretty , demure brunette woman ( Lisa Zane ) whom he met in a park only a short time ago . Then , one day she dissappears . The police are unable to find any documentation that she ever existed , and Firth conducts his own search . So far , so good . Just as he 's about to give up , he turns to his womanizing best friend ( Billy Zane ) , and they stumble onto her former life in L.A. 's sordid underground of drugs , nightclubs , and ametuer filmmaking , and then to her history of mental instability . At that point , Firth 's life is in danger , and the film falls apart . None of the characters from Lisa Zane 's past are remotely interesting . The film moves slowly , and there 's very little action . There is a subplot regarding missing drug money , but it 's just a throwaway . No chases , no cliffhanging sequences , and no suspense . Just some dull beatings and a lot of chat by boring characters . One thing worth noting , Lisa Zane and Billy Zane are brother and sister , but they never appear in a scene together . By the end of the movie , you 're torn between wondering what might have been and trying to stay awake .  
0	  The Minion is about .. well , a minion . A servant of Satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped . He is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another . Anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage . Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas , a member of a secret order of Templars , who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion . The movie begins a thousand years ago , in the Middle East where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion . Then flash forward to 1999 , where the key winds up somewhere underground in New York . An archeologist is assigned to study / dig the place where the key was found . Needless to say , the minion is after the key , and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and Lukas and archeologist . The movie , is just that , a low budget B-movie flick . The movie lacks energy , and just trods along . You 'll follow the chase but you won't ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies ( especially The Terminator films ) . The fight scenes with the minion is troublesome , in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is . It " skillfully " becomes a one-man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one-on one . And it 's supposed to be around for a long time . All this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience . The whole idea of a secret order of Templars , a door to hell , and the key isn't well explained . We are merely to accept that they just exist . The movie seems to have been made with the feeling there 's not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks . Dolph Lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else . The verdict : 2 of 5 stars .  
0	  This movie has made me upset ! When I think of Cat in the hat . Im thinking of cat in the hat books . You know , the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children . Well , I though that this movie would be a lot like that ! But much to my suprise was nothing like the books ! Insted it is more like young adult humor movie . In one part cat is talking to a gardening tool ( hoe ) cat talks to it like it is his hoe ( agin adult humor ) . the naming of his car I all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie . under the rating you 'll find : mild cude humor and some double-entendres . I think in short this means adult humor . I wish I could return this movie ! wal-mart said they wouldn't because the movie has been opened . If you are thinking about buying this I suggest that maybe rent before you buy .  
1	  A lot has been said about Shinjuku Triad Society as the first true " Miike " film and I thought this sort of description might have been a cliché . But , like all clichés , it is based on the truth . All the Miike trademarks are here , the violence , the black humour , the homosexuality , the taboo testing and the difficult to like central character . Shinjuku is however , one of Miike 's most perfectly formed films . He says in an interview that if he made it again it would be different , but not necessarily better . I think what he means is that the film possesses a truly captivating energy and raw edge which seems so fresh that although he might be able to capture a more visually or technically complex movie he could not replicate or better the purity of this film . As you might expect , the violence is utterly visceral , gushing blood and gritty beatings are supplemented by a fantastic scene in which a woman has a chair smashed over her face . ( Only a Miike film could let you get away with a sentence like that . ) The film has a fantastic pace , unlike Dead or Alive which begins and ends strongly and dips in the middle . Dead or Alive also deals with similar issues , Miike is clearly concerned about the relations between the Japanese and Chinese in the postwar period and this emotive subject is handled well here , the central character really coming to life when you begin to understand his past . I cannot sing Shinjuku 's praises enough . I do not want to give away too much . This is Miike before he began to use CGI to animate his films and is almost reminiscent of something like Kitano 's Sonatine . The central characters are superbly realized and the final twist guarantees that as soon as the film has finished you 'll be popping it back on again to work it all out .  
0	  Director Spike Lee is famous for making films pointing out racism . In many of films , such " Do The Right Thing , " most of the white people are all brutal racists . In this movie , interracial marriage is the subject , with racism once again being the entire issue . What Lee does , however , is once again demonstrate his bigotry against Christianity . It 's amazing the double standards that exist in the film world . If Lee or anyone else ever produced this kind of bias against another group he would be vilified , but Christians ? Hey , it 's " open season " on them . Ossie Davis , a reverend in this film , shoots his son and then puts the smoldering gun down on top of his Bible . They zoom in on that for another closeup just in case you missed it . Hey , folks , here 's another Bible reader and look what he 's like ! Lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes . He shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations . Who could argue with portraying racism as an evil thing ? However , Lee perpetuates it in this film as he has in his other films . His obvious bitterness toward white people doesn't help the situation . It only adds fuel to the fire . Hey , Spike : start " doing the right thing " and leave your prejudices in the closet . Better yet , " get over it . " This is too bad because the subject matter could have made for a thought - provoking film if it had been done with objectivity and intelligence .  
0	  * May contain spoilers . * If LIVING ON TOKYO TIME were some bold experiment where real-life wanna-be actors were given film parts on the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful prescription anti-anxiety , anti-depression , and anti-psychotic medications ( this is the classic psych ward combo that renders patients into drooling zombies ) all during filming , then this movie would hold far more interest . Or , if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep deprived before and during filming , then TOKYO TIME could be more easily explained . As it is , this film is filled with lifeless , low-energy actors . In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister , it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eyes open . In almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with every part of his body motionless . From beginning to end , his facial expression is best described as " near sleep . " Fret not about the actors speaking over each other 's lines because these actors can barely finish droning out any lines of dialog . Everyone speaks with a depressing , monotone voice . No laughing . No yelling . No vigor . No one has energy enough to crack a smile . The result : complete and total boredom . And it does not help matters that the direction is simple and amateurish . Avoid this lifeless film at all costs . Better to watch GREENCARD which has a similar plot and has charm and energy . Or , for an unconventional Japanese romance story , check out THE LONG VACATION which has an ample amount of everything LIVING ON TOKYO TIME does not .  
1	  Methinks the best screen version of Quo Vadis ? ever made . Well , yeah , the plot is not so strong and evident as in the book , sometimes meandering and loosing its suspense among aesthetic subtleties . But the film is really and beautifully " strange " , has an enigma and style , that other versions - with R.Taylor and the new one from Poland - definitely lack . It has the air of Roman decadence , the beauty of declining paganism and infant Christianity . At least I believe it has ) . Brandauer , Forrest and Syudov did excellent job in portraying their characters . Forrest 's Petronius seems to be the biggest success of the cast ( let alone Brandauer who is the one of the greatest actors ever ) and accumulates the very essence of this dying world ( IMHO ) . That 's it . That is the way it happened , guys .. ) ) ) IMHO  
1	  The Shining starts with Jack Torrance ( Jack Nicholson ) driving to an isolated hotel named the ' Overlook ' situated high in the Colorado mountains for an interview with it 's manager Stuart Ullman ( Barry Nelson ) about becoming the Winter caretaker . Ullman tells Jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh Winter sets in . Together with his wife Wendy ( Shelley Duvall ) & young son Danny ( Danny Lloyd ) Jack moves into the hotel & at first everything seems fine , it 's a beautiful hotel , absolutely huge & whatever they need is at their disposal . However the Overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide & Danny has the ability to ' shine ' which means he has psychic powers that let him see & hear things ' ordinary ' people can't . As the days , weeks & months begin to pass Jack become more & more insane , Danny keeps ' seeing ' things & people while Wendy becomes frantic as she doesn't have a clue what 's happening to her family , as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped Jack finally loses it .. This English production was co-written , co-produced & directed by Stanley Kubrick & is a fine horror film . It appears that The Shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions & the one I will be commenting on is the shorter European cut that runs just under 2 hours in length . The script by Kubrick & Diane Johnson , is based on the novel by Stephen King which I have not read so I can't compare them , goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film . There are very few character 's in The Shining with Jack , Wendy & Danny the only ones that really matter , since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them , become involved with them & what they go through . The pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didn't feel that long & keeps you interested throughout . On the negative side I don't think the reasoning behind Jack going crazy & wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me , the fact that Jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me & I don't know if I missed something but that ending didn't make any sense to me whatsoever , I 'm still trying to work out what that picture is all about ! There is very little in the way of violence or gore , a couple of rotten zombie ghosts & someone is killed with an axe but The Shining is a horror film that doesn't need to rely on blood & special effects as it has a gripping story . With a budget of about $ 19,000,000 The Shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as Kubrick , the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic free-flowing & smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the character 's around the maze of corridors , the sets look absolutely real & instead of clichéd old haunted house themes like dark corners , basements & cobwebs Kubrick brings things right up-to-date with brightly lit corridors , massive open expansive spaces & a modern decor ( well 80 's modern , just check that red toilet out ! ) . The acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying & Nicholson seems crazy from the very start . The Shining is an absorbing film that I enjoyed watching although I 'm not sure I 'd watch it again anytime soon . For those looking for explosions & fancy special effects you will be disappointed , for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story I definitely think The Shining is for you , well worth a watch in my humble opinion .  
0	  Though not a fan of Sam Rockwell , I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits in the opening of ' Joshua . ' Heck , I wasn't even aware he was in ' Joshua ' until I started the movie . So it goes without saying , I was watching the movie on the basis of the movie , not the leads . A sort of ' Rosemary 's Baby , ' ' The Omen ' or any other demonic kid movie ' Joshua ' was billed . Unfortunately , it fell flat . Slow , incredibly slow , and flat . Yet , I continued on to see how this would all resolve , hoping beyond belief , the ending climax would shed some light on the subject . Okay , I admit , it did ( a wee bit ) but what a stale closing . And what a low-low budget movie , or at least that 's how they designed it . A person falls  you don't see the drop , you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood . A person gets hit by a cab  you don't see it , you see someone complaining , holding a bike up . I 'm not sure if this is called " style " or laziness or simply , lack of funds for special effects . We have a " rich " family with a crazy mom , a workaholic father attempting to balance everything , a kid  Joshua , who may / may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot . She cries as much as we see how many days she 's alive  and what was that about ? Are there rats above or is it Joshua ? Is his mother nuts ? Is Joshua crazy ? Is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family ? Is he going to grow up to be Michael Myers ? Or does he drive his family to the brink ? I don't think so . They were nuts prior , and no " so-called " acting could make me believe otherwise . Unfortunately , barely any questions were answered , barely any open doors shut . I 'm sure that might have been the idea , but for Pete 's sake , give me something . Anything . There are plenty better kid-gone-wild movies to explore . Joshua 's more like the Mini-Me of the antichrist .  
0	  I stopped watching lost at this episode because I thought Ana-Lucia and Libby 's deaths were unnecessary and really depressing . Then I found out that they kept Libby around just to die in the next episode ! Gah ! I can't handle it . I liked this show for the first season , but it definitely declined in the second season , I found Jack and Locke 's little religious feud to be annoying . The deaths of Rodriguez & Watros ' characters was the final straw ! I give this episode a 4/10 , for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by Alias legend J.J. Abrams . I hope his series in the future will improve on this one .  
0	  I saw this movie twice . I can't believe Pintilie made such a fantasy movie . I 'm also a movie / theatre director and I know what I speak . This is not Romania anymore , but I see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 September . No story , no plot , nothing . No conclusion , no message , nothing profound , nothing hidden . Just empty images . What most of Romanians don't know , this movie is for the french viewers , not for us . They really believe that is the reality in Romania . Also for teenagers . Pintilie should stop making movies . I don't really know if we can call this a movie , maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we 've got such an image in Europe . This WAS a reality , but isn't anymore . A good friend of mine from the Brithish embassy said : " You have no idea what a long way Romanian people walked from Ceausescu " .

1	  Knowing what to expect ( on the whole ) from a Denzel Washington performance - quality , integrity , gravitas , wry humour - will prepare you for what to expect from his directorial debut . Much like Robert De Niro 's A Bronx Tale , Antwone Fisher delivers the moving drama of the life of a young man and the effects of key figures in his life . Much as in A Bronx Tale De Niro played one of these key figures to the lead character ( himself a character was born to play but was too old too ) Washington takes a similar role in this as the fatherly councellor to the titular character - a character that seems like he should be played by a Washington from 20 years ago . Be thankful Washington is too old to play Antwone because if he had we would firstly be deprived of the wonderfully measured and intelligently nuanced performance he gives as the Navy councellor . However more importantly we wouldn't get to see the superb , we can only hope star making , turn from Derek Luke in the title role . Inevitably the character comes across as moulded in Washington 's shape , however you get the impression this is not just because Washington directed it , not that Luke was trying to copy him , but that Luke is as genuinely powerful and thought provoking an actor as Washington . It took far too long for Washington to receive the Academy award he deserved for Malcolm X , Philadelphia , Devil In A Blue Dress and The Hurricane , let us hope that Luke does not have to wait so long . Also a great piece of casting was Joy Bryant as Fisher 's girlfriend , Cheryl . While the part could have been a forgettable support or a standard ' girlfriend ' role Bryant imbues it with life . Tender and intelligent the role transcends stereotyping with Bryant inhabiting it , and she makes the part significant and interesting . It doesn't hurt either that Bryant is possibly the most attractive woman you 'll see on celluloid this year - the smile alone could thaw the coldest heart . Acting ability and looks - why isn't this woman in everything being made right now . Providing good support in a small role in Salli Richardson as Washington 's wife Berta . Saying more with a silence or look than many Hollywood actresses can manage in an entire film she informs the audience of the entire storylines long before any exposition occurs . As for Washington 's directing , as I said , it is the directing equivalent of his acting . Taking the story of a man few viewers will have heard of and making it genuinely interesting is a difficult feat which Washington achieves with aplomb . The film is neither rushed nor showy , but it never feels slow or dull . It is measured and nuanced , balancing the humour and drama perfectly . Antwone Fisher may not blow you away if you like big , explosive , plotless Hollywood films but for those who appreciate a finely crafted character piece , with excellent performances and steady well handled direction , this is for you .  
1	  Excellent film . Suzy Kendall will hold your interest throughout . Has not been shown on American TV for a decade . One scene that has always stayed with me is the German cavalry gas attack . You will find others . Hope they soon put it on tape .  
0	  The best thing about camp films in general is that you know what to expect . It 's like watching a professional wrestling match or a day time soap opera or a Jerry Springer show : you immediately can follow the skimpy plot , identify the cardboard characters , and watch in satisfaction while all the cliches are being fulfilled . However , at times , the director does something real unexpected . It may be something extraordinarily stupid , or something weird , or something insightful . The director Makinen is up there with the best camp directors , and this is his best movie . In Yon saalistajat , everything seems to come together . There 's nothing good about it , but still manages to be a coherent whole . Not once does the movie slow down - the action flows on and punches keep on coming . The weirdest thing is that there 's no sense of time : some characters seem to take months doing something while other characters have only spent one hour at a bar . This is partially due to Finnish summer where the sun never sets , so you don't experience the day turning into a night at all . Finally : there is a plot , there , somewhere . You may have to watch the movie three times before you realize it , though .  
1	  Taking over roles that Jack Albertson and Sam Levene played on Broadway , Walter Matthau and George Burns play a couple of old time vaudeville comics , a team in the tradition of Joe Smith and Charles Dale who seem to have a differing outlook on life . Walter Matthau can't stop working , the man has never learned to relax , take some time and smell the roses . He 's a crotchety old cuss whose best days are behind him and his nephew and agent Richard Benjamin is finding less and less work for him . What hurt him badly was that some 15 years earlier his partner George Burns decided to retire and spend some time with his family . A workaholic like Matthau can't comprehend it and take Burns 's decision personally . Benjamin hits on a brain storm , reunite the guys and do it on a national television special . What happens here is pretty hilarious . The Sunshine Boys is also a sad , bittersweet story as well about old age . Matthau is on screen for most of the film , but it 's Burns who got the kudos in the form of an Oscar at the ripe old age of 79 . Burns brought a bit of the personal into this film as well . As we all know he was the straight man of the wonderful comedy team of Burns & Allen who the Monty Python troop borrowed a lot from . In 1958 due to health reasons , Gracie Allen retired and George kept going right up to the age of 100 . Or at least pretty close to as an active performer . The Sunshine Boys is based on the team of Smith & Dale however and if you like The Sunshine Boys I strongly recommend you see Two Tickets to Broadway for a look at a pair of guys who were entertaining the American public at the turn of the last century . The doctor sketch that Matthau and Burns do is directly from their material . And I do think you will like The Sunshine Boys .  
1	  Damn , was that a lot to take in . I was pretty much mesmerised throughout . It was pretty perfect , though I would say the editing had a lot to do with that . I can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them ( Anton especially ) to get all of this footage without any serious .. beef . The Dandy 's did come off well-together , middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation ( and rightly so ! ) . I felt bad for Jonestown and especially for Anton , which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt . Great piece of film-making and great choice of subject ( s ) . I recommend this to any music / film fan . You 'll probably learn something about film-making .  
0	  This film is a travesty , and isn't fit to keep company with the superior original . The plot is an absolute mess , and the film is way too long . Everytime they 're struggling , they desperately inject a sentimental reminder from the first film . " Gregory 's Girl " is one of the top 10 British films of all time , this one is awful .  
0	  I am truly beginning to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how crappy his films could become . This particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time to see . My first complaint was the cover of the DVD where they have doctored his pic and made him look slimmer and younger when in the film he looks like crap . He has his big pot belly and double chin going for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face . The whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and drawn out way too long . The whole film was leading up to the finale where Seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancer . There was way too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of Seagals voice even in the middle of a statement . The dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical . The fight scenes in the film were horrible . Half the time when Seagal fought you could not even see what was going on . There would be tight shots of him flapping his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something . It was reminiscent of the old Kung Fu series on television . They used way too much slow motion for the fight scenes . I believe this is Seagals worst film to date and I am glad I did not purchase this film or I would have been very upset since I am a huge fan of Seagal the Aikidoist . The action star is quickly fading away and seems to be getting worse with every performance .  
1	  This movie is an exact copy of a TV series on Indian television channel doordarshan Which was aired at least 15 years ago . The series was known as " gubbarre " meaning balloons . Each episode was a new short story . The story is excellent and the original is much sweeter and " convincing " Abhay Doel does a good job but he doesn't fit the role of a " normal " and " third class " guys ( as he calls himself in the movie ) . In fact Shayan Munshi with his hair cut short and without the designer clothes would have fitted the Abhays role but Shayan just doesn't have the talent to pull it off . I would suggest watching the series if it is available . It is the same story except for the running around with the friends mother and the initial introduction . The acting of the TV actors was much better than these " stars " . The only reason this movies is a flop is because the director tried to stretch half an hour ( or 45 minutes ) story to 2 + hours . So it has to get draggy . Even the nasal singing sensations songs could not make up . This movies is good for a lazy Sunday afternoon and is really refreshing if you haven't watched the original TV serial . The script and the ending of the serial was much better # SPOILERS AHEAD # # SPOILERS AHEAD # # SPOILERS AHEAD # # SPOILERS AHEAD # # SPOILERS AHEAD # THe ending of the original serial was much stronger as the hero himself dumps the girl even thought she is willing to marry him . HE is aware and tell her that he doesn't want to be " repayed " and never helped with that intention . The director or the script writes somehow could not capture the original ending in this film . The original ending would have bought tears to the girls eyes and would have had the guys nodding in agreement . The deliver just wasn't right . But personally I feel this is a pathetic copy . No credit should be given to the director / scriptwriter . The story is amazing and is by one of the famous novel writers int he class of PRemchand munshi . I am not sure if this is premchand munshi 's story but many of the other short stories int he series feature a few of premchand munshi 's and other great Hindi writers stories .  
1	  Once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they .. somehow .. managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended , you 'll find that it 's not half bad . The plot is engaging and interesting , and the pacing is fast , with this covering many situations , and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken . Where this really stands out is the acting . The performances are excellent . Neill and Streep are both impeccable . It 's also cool to hear so much Australian spoken in a Hollywood film , and even those who don't come naturally to it at least attempt an accent . The cinematography and editing are nice enough , but they don't really go beyond the standard stuff . This movie 's story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling . While I have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture , I understand that it is quite close to the truth . There is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this . It is , at times , a downright great courtroom drama . I recommend this to any fellow fan of such . 7/10  
1	  Having seen CUBE , I 've been a fan of Vincenzo Natali 's work . Natali seems to have this inept ability to take a storyline , and hardly wring it our like a wet towel for all the storyline he can muster . Instead , he lets the stories themselves unfold in natural ways , so much in fact , that you may in fact believe there is this Cube were people try to escape , or in the case of NOTHING , a large empty expanse where there is .. nothing ! The advert had me hooked instantly . It seemed so simple ! Take two characters who no one likes , and send them to a world where there is nothing . Natali does this so simply that you forget the logic that a place where there is nothing cannot exist . In fact , the world of nothing becomes something of an irony within the film . There 's nothing there , but also ' something ' there . It might be a good time to point out that the trailer is highly misleading . I was fortunate enough to actually understand that the film leaned to a more comedic side than the trailer otherwise told so . Therefore upon watching the film , i laughed every now and again , whereas someone who the advert mislead may find themselves utterly confused . If i may take a minute to give the film some praise , where the film excels on is the concept . It is a genius concept to have a world of nothing , and to put two characters there , NOT two brilliant minded characters , who will philosophise and work out their surroundings , but two idiots who have absolutely no clue as to where the hell they are ! Another strong point is the film 's cinematography , though at first this may not seem it ! Where each wall , north , earth , south , west , up and down is just a white plane , a perception of depth becomes faulty . It is hard to determine where things are placed in the Mis-En-Scene . The cinematography has many moments where this actually happens , but for the most part , the camera is placed so that two characters , or an object and a character are placed in the foreground and background , allowing a sense of depth to be realised . However , this film does lack in certain areas . The film is relatively short , but even so , after a while the novelty of this world of nothing becomes rather dull , and you wish to find some form of resolution within the plot . We can also argue that the acting is once again , questionable . These two characters are in a sense , unlikeable , therefore we feel no sympathy at any point for these characters . However , on a flip side of that , the chemistry and friendship between the two characters seems real enough , but there is something lacking . Even so , i do rank this as a thoroughly enjoyable film ! Do not let the trailer fool you into thinking this is another science-fiction horror film . It is much more of a comedy than that ! It is indeed worth watching though , purely for the concept itself !  
0	  The earlier part of the film was rather enjoyable but towards the end it became trite . Although Turturro is an actor I generally like , his Luzhin often resembled a bad Rain Man impression and the portrayal of the genius as a semi-autistic man was annoying . Overall it seems as if this film is trying to hard and ends up looking pompous in spite of mostly fine performances .  
1	  I saw Soylent Green back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on T.V. or video . It was always one of my favorite sci-fi and / or Charlton Heston films . Recently , the Egyptian theater in L.A. had a twelve film Charlton Heston retrospective . I flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period . Soylent Green looked great on the large Egyptian screen with a perfect new print . From its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic . Charlton Heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and Eddie Robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great . Their chemistry together is wonderful . The film also looks so much better in a great 35mm print . Fleisher really knows how to fill the screen , and the cinematoraphy , writing , music used , and everything about it works . The film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future . Just think how the world population grew , the rain forest that disappeared , resources used up , green house effect getting worse since 1973 . I just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years . Its reputation should be better . Speaking of reputations , often people speak as if Charlton Heston is not a great actor . Seeing him in El-Cid , Soylent Green , The Warlord , The Omega Man , Will Penny , and Major Dundee back to back I am convinced he is one of our best actors . Of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are .  
1	  This is a film that everyone should watch . Quite apart from raising hugely important points ( while South Africa is on the road to recovery there are still many countries in similar situations now ) , it is superbly directed while Denzel Washington gives , in my opinion , the best performance in his career so far . Kline also gives a good performance , although perhaps not as stunning as Washington 's . John Thaw also puts in a good turn as the Chief of Police . There are so many possible areas where a film on apartheid could fall down , but all of these have been avoided . It would be easy to simply portray white people as the bad guys and black people as the good guys , but Attenborough has not done this . Sure , there were some white characters who seemed inherently evil , such as the Captain at the Soweto uprising , but to add extra dimensions to all the characters would make the film unbearably long . Some people complain about the length of the film as it is , but I think it needs the whole two and a half hours to tell the whole story , for it really is an incredible one . The best scene in the film is that of Steve Biko 's funeral . When the whole crowd begins to sing the South African national anthem , it is probably one of , if not the most moving scenes I have seen . If you haven't seen this film already : watch it . It may not be comfortable viewing , but it 's certainly worth it .  
0	  They played this on the July 4th Twilight Zone marathon and this is , hands down , the worst Twilight Zone episode I 've ever seen . It 's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone . Even though Twilight Zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable , this one was completely out of place . Compare this to legendary episodes like " A Stop at Willoughby " or " Midnight Sun " , and you realize there is no comparison . Buster Keaton did what he could with such terrible material , and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would stoop to the level of this episode . Even though he seemed to be giving it some effort , he MUST have needed the money .. there 's no other explanation .  
0	  This movie is really goofy ! I saw it as an 11 year old , and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous ! I would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12 . I really didn't care for it , but I do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of , such as : 1 ) Does money buy happiness ? 2 ) Should I lie ( to my parents ) about things I think they wouldn't approve of ? 3 ) Does money buy friendships ? 4 ) Is money everything ? 5 ) Shouldn't I tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me ? Granted , these are very unrealistic situations , but I do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children , maybe they should watch this video as well , in order to show / scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt .  
0	  THE . WORST . FILM . EVER . MADE . After watching this supposedly gay made film , I suspect someone rounded up a brain damaged half blind neo-nazi and had him make the worst gay film ever , all in some deluded attempt to attack gay culture . I had to stop the movie and call a friend to come over just so I had someone to scoff at when I paused the movie out of shock , disbelief and outrage at such sheer stupidity . On top of all the horrible writing and acting and illogical and stupid plot , its just a poorly made film . A dog with a handycam tied to its tail could have churned out better . Seriously , after reading the few positive reviews this movie has here , I suspect the writer must have a half a dozen IMDb accounts . Anyone who says this film is even watchable as anything other than a joke , is a liar or being paid heavily to say so .  
0	  There are a number of problems with this movie , but the bottom line is that it tried to do too much with too little . The base story is quite good , but the money just wasn't there to do the story justice . The non-existent budget really killed this movie . Stuart Gordon ( the writer / director ) has writing credit on ' Honey , I Shrunk the Kids ' , which was a box office smash . However , that movie had some serious cash backing from Disney . Honestly , this is a good example of when to not make a movie . Had he waited a few more years , technology would have made it cheaper to do many of the effects . ( not to mention he could have found a company with money . )  
0	  Despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating , this is an awful movie . Awful enough , that l feel obligated to warn you how bad it is . The movie is set in the final period of the Raj , during the time of India 's fight for independence . What follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief . What the characters do and how they behave just does not persuade me that the characters exist in that era . For instance , would the young married Hindu housemaid from the local village have an affair with her married Englishman Master , knowing full well that discovery of the affair would likely mean utter social ostracization and shame if not mortal punishment ? Unlikely , but still maybe . However , would the same young Hindu housemaid , in the conservative society of India of that era carry on like a half naked Britney Spears in heat , partake in hot outdoor sex during daylight in open view where they might be discovered at any moment ? That is not only bloody unlikely , that is a retarded plot line . Such idiocies combined with the poor acting , drove me to leave the cinema an hour into the movie , so i did not watch the second half of the movie . One could only hope the ending is of more intelligence than what i saw in the first half .  
0	  By now you should already know about this film , the Jessica Simpson " bomb " that pretty much went straight to video ( limited , anemic theatrical run ) . Basically , Ms . Simpson 's Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend , to surprise him , only to find him in bed with another woman . She is stranded , but has one friend ( Rachel Leigh Cook , whom I wish we saw more often in film ) , who lets her stay . Katie ends up getting a job via two conniving co-workers ( Penelope Ann Miller and the always amusing Andy Dick ) who are just using Katie to get the president of the firm ( Larry Miller ) ousted . This is strictly a b movie , its not meant to be profound . Jessica Simpson is not a great actress by any means , but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying . The film is watchable in that its not an abomination , but its throwaway fluff . In a cameo , Penny Marshall is funny ( a subtle in-joke about Milwaukee made me chuckle ) , and there is a funny scene involving Norwegian priests ( don't read too much into this ) . So , not horrible , but easy to skip . Your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does . Again , not good , but not a profound disaster .  
1	  Lost is largely considered one of the most beautiful TV series that have never done .. and so is .. if you lovers of mysteries , intrigue and adventure this is the series for you .. In the first season .. since the first episode starts to go increasingly to move forward until you get to the second season .. in the second you lose a little its cocktail of mystery and expectation and pushes very on and reveal the various mysteries that the island hides .. the third season is perhaps the second most beautiful because resumed suffered since the first episode with the pace and tenacity of the first season .. the fourth also not let pass unnoticed and tends to reveal a little mysteries .. but not as the second season but at a somewhat different .. For the fifth season expects ..  
0	  Many people see this as a classic , but I obviously must have missed something . Life in Anarene , Texas in the early 50 's is pretty dull - which means that a movie about life in Anarene , Texas in the early 50 's will be pretty dull too ! What is it that so many people see in this ? Once the last picture show in Anarene closes there really won't be anything to do in town . Duane ( Jeff Bridges ) makes that point at the end of the movie . But even before it closes there isn't much to do , so basically everything revolves around sex . High school students make plans for how to lose their virginity - sometimes with each other and sometimes with some of the equally bored adults in town . You see , there 's not much for them to do either - except to have sex ( sometimes with each other and sometimes with the bored teenagers ) or to whine about the local high school football team . Three times something happened that I thought was going to add some spark of drama to the movie . Sam ( Ben Johnson ) dies unexpectedly , but nothing really happens because of that , Sonny ( Timothy Bottoms ) and Jacy ( Cybill Shepherd ) elope , but nothing really happens because of that , Joe Bob ( Barc Doyle ) kidnaps a little girl , but nothing really happens because of that . The only thing that added anything of dramatic value to the movie came at the end with the death of Billy ( Sam Bottoms ) which really points out the emptiness of life in this pathetic little town , as the men stand around looking at the body debating where to go for breakfast . Peter Bogdanovic filmed this in black and white , which is intended I suppose to point out how grey this town is , but the only thing I found interesting was the early look at actors like Bottoms , Shepherd , Bridges and Randy Quaid . ( As an aside it was terrifying to see how much Quaid - in 1971 - actually looks like his character of Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation movies . ) Classic ? I don't think so ! 3/10  
0	  Is it possible to give a movie NO STARS ? I suppose not . However many stars IMDb displays this just think zero and you 'll get my drift . Director and photographer Timothy Hines didn't have much of a budget compared to Spielberg 's Herculean effort with the same material ( rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made ) , but that need not be an insurmountable handicap . I 've seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring ( " Soldier and Saints " is a recent example ) . With hard work , integrity and , above all , talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of Wells ' novella - and at fraction of what was spent by Dreamworks on its " War of the Worlds " . Unfortunately , Hines failed in all these departments . Even if he had had Spielberg 's budget and Tom Cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal he 's foisted on us . Primarily , Hines seems unable to tell a story . Thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound , but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records . A guy walks down a country lane , a lot . He talks badly aped Received English to some other guy . Then he walks down the same lane , only shot from the back this time to show he 's returning - clever , eh ? Walking and talking , for nearly an hour that 's all that happens . OK , I 'll grant that one extended excursion from the main character 's house to the impact site on Horsell Common to show that it 's a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful ( a first-year film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this , btw ) , but half a dozen times ? Back and forth , back and forth , et cetera , et cetera with some yakkity-yak in between . Remarkable . The only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish CG works into something that could be offered as a feature-length film . Finally the Martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking , or shrieking . Later we get staggering and wailing for dessert . Thankfully , much of the dialogue is lifted straight from H.G. Wells ' text ; else we 'd have no idea what is going on . But is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text , to realize what words alone can't convey ? If a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel , why bother ? Why not do a radio play ? Orson Welles made himself a household name doing just that . However , Hines thinks he 's a filmmaker , so he 's content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning . Secondly , Hines was able to buy some CG effects of a sort for his movie , but he has no idea how to use them . Now I for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy . I believe good science fiction cinema doesn't need dazzling technical effects . Some really potent Sci-Fi 's have flourished on virtually none at all . But " The War of the Worlds " as film requires a certain baseline effort . Wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled . The effects don't need to be complex ; they can even be crude ( e.g. fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the George Pal / Byron Haskins 1953 version ) , but they must be handled well . Unfortunately Hines ' effects are both crude and incompetent  tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum  Martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort  skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream - the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times ( flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice )  and on ad nauseum . Crude technique is forgivable . So you have a CG fire effect that 's less than convincing ? Fine , we can work around that . Just don't use it too often and only show glimpses of it . That stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum ? Throw it away . It 's not necessary . You say your Martian flyer looks like a toy on a string ? If you must use it , go ahead , but please don't show it twice ! But no , Hines won't listen . We get the worst looking stuff used again and again . Gotta get those 180 minutes somehow , boy . Next we have acting , or more precisely too much acting . Whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out . Evidently Hines thinks he 's getting a bargain - More fleeing in terror over there ! You , quaking behind that tree , let 's have a real conniption fit this take . You call that writhing in agony ? Nonsense , my grandmother can writhe better - Nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink . They aren't even good amateurs . But this needn't prove fatal . Many a good movie has been made with rancid acting . That 's what directors are for . And editors . Which brings up another point Who the hell let Tim Hines edit this cheese factory ? If America 's butchers were as adept at meat cutting as Hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef . In spite of the near three-hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie - not sequences , but single frames , creating a herky-jerky effect that 's nauseating to watch . Maybe Hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890 's . If he was I can say he doesn't know how to do it .  
0	  My teacher taped this and showed it to us in Child Care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people . It just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny , unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and couldn't tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such . I wouldn't be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script . Stacy 's ( the carrier of the baby ) mother is a riot . She is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window . Bobby 's ( the father ) best friend 's name is Dewey , and is an obvious rip off of Sean Penn 's character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High . This movie is horrid , simply because none of the characters are believable . Thank goodness it 's only made for TV , limiting the public 's chances of viewing it .  
1	  I know the film snobs are snorting . But if you 're looking for a surprisingly fun ride through the B-movie jungle , try " Jake Speed " . A little thin at times , but its one-liners and the location more then make up for this . John Hurt ( God love him ) , seems to be having fun doing his role as the ultra evil white slaver . The nemesis of Crawfords , Jake Speed . He adds a dimension to the film that only a pro like Hurt could provide . Crawford and Dennis Christopher ( Jakes sidekick ) are a good team , although you do wonder why they both put up with each other . However , together both Crawford and Christopher portray a team that is just so much fun that , if you can get over yourself for a moment , you may find yourself acting like a kid again at the situations and the inherent suspense they provide . The delicious Karen Kopins does a great job as the damsel in distress that is more concerned about the motives of her rescuer then her tormentor . I have yet to find a movie that is as much fun without getting preachy , or bogging down the movie by trying too hard . Not every movie has to be the latest " Citizen Kane " . And trust me , Wells was an original . So lets remember that sometimes , movies are for fun . Not social commentary or attempting to sway an audience politically . But just for the sheer fun of being alive and living in a time when our hero 's live in a celluloid dimension .  
1	  " Dragonlord " sees Chan returning to his role of " Dragon " from " The Young Master " . Not much has carried over from the first film though . " Tiger " , his older brother , is nowhere to be seen ; neither is the Marshall , his daughter or his son played superbly by Yuen Biao in the original film . Dragon does have the same master though - presumably all the other students have moved on to other things . ( Dragon 's laziness at training is portrayed heavily in this film , so maybe he 's still studying ! ) Originally titled " Young Master In Love " , this film sees Dragon ( for the first sixty minutes at least ) pursuing a villager girl in various idiotic and slapstick ways . His rival for her affection is his friend ( inappropriately named " Cowboy " ) played comically by the longtime Chan Stunt-team member Mars . We see various scenes where their silly schemes backfire . It is one of these scenes that we ( thankfully ) find " Dragon " in over his head . This film is notorious in that it failed expectations at the box office . That said , I 'm sure the expectations were pretty high , and I feel that this film has never had a fair judgment based on it 's own merits . But even when I try to do this , I still feel that there is a problem with the film . It seems quite unfocused , sometimes rushed , and I think the action is too sporadic and not as brilliant as Chan 's other work from this period . The thing that really saves the film is the ending sequence . As in " The Young Master " , there is a fantastic final reel that it full of incredibly exhausting action - you really feel every blow . And again , Chan goes up against the same rival from " The Young Master " ( is it the same character ? ) , and the timing and energy here is brilliant . Chan 's style of using every last bit of his environment to help defeat his opponent - not just relying on pure physical ability - is as apparent here as anywhere else . The barn they fight in is full of clever little prop gags and improvisations . This is an absolute highlight of the film and one of Chan 's incredible career . It 's not necessary to see the prequel before seeing " Dragonlord " , in fact , it might even raise more questions than what it hopes to answer . But it must be said that the original film is the superior film , and " Dragonlord " , with it 's focus on girl-chasing and team-sports does seem baffling . Luckily , the few fight scenes it offers ( plus a fantastic shuttle-cock scene ) push it over the line as a must-see film in this genre .  
1	  Like others , I have seen and studied most of the books and films concerning the Clutter Killings , including a few dramatic works thematically based on the actions and psycho-mythology of the participants to the crime - including Capote himself . As to Capote , I cannot forgive him for willfully withholding Perry Smith 's confessions , intimacies and writings from even the defense counsels . I believe truths and facts Capote " reserved " for his " book , " which required for Capote two guilty verdicts and capital punishment , would almost certainly have sustained a successful insanity defense for Perry Smith even under the old McNaughton Rule . Capote himself could never write another major literary work after " In Cold Blood . " Shame and guilt . In my opinion , he willingly encouraged and planned the brutal capital punishment to provide the spectacular ending he required for his book / drama . To him , both men HAD to die for his book to succeed . The book had to justify itself by pretending it was about the horror of capital punishment . His actions and silence assured that ice-cold conclusion . Capote 's book is not truth . It is not factual or journalistic . It is drama and melodrama spiced with his own creatively psychotic imagination . What most people consider the virtues of the contemporaneous first movie are stark images of Capote 's mind , which may have been the most cold-blooded aspect of all . No wonder viewers ironically but necessarily prefer Blake 's performance . That actor IS the nightmare from Capote 's dishonest imaginings . So who is to say how the two killers should be played ? Who is to judge what could make an essentially poetic psychotic snap from excessive courtesy and kindness to " do it now " killing ? I agree with the few who see in Eric Roberts ' work a magnificent performance , Shakespearean in its range , yet played with heartbreaking sincerity . Anthony Edwards takes a much safer " attitude mode " to create a smarmy Hickok ; but he is one-dimensional and boring , with only a few notes in his television range . Roberts is almost four-dimensional , adding physical weakness and agony to a powerful animal body , a Frankenstein Creature who thinks in poetry and knows exactly what NOT to do . Like Leopold apropos Loeb , Robert 's Perry Smith is hopelessly in love with an evil man . Without Hickok or a man of his particularities , Perry Smith would not have brought his psychotic mind into a world of horrors . He fears himself more than he fears anything else in life . Given the freedom from Capote 's death grip on the consciousness of the Clutter killings , Roberts and Edwards are free to create original personalities and psychoses to craft a different and new production of the drama . Same facts , some of the same lines from the case record , but deeper , more complex , with clearly titanic psychotic stresses - indeed Roberts is so good at this fluidic madness that he physically and facially demonstrates in every moment how little awareness he has of where or who he is . What many of our reviewers dislike about this film , Roberts in particular , is that cold-blooded killing isn't shown the way they expect and have been manipulated to demand . That is because here we are seeing a far more profoundly realistic " interpretation of life and death " than Capote could ever create - a real Tragedy . The actual cold-blooded killer , Mr. Capote , and his hypocritically artistic " non-fiction novel " do not control these interpretations and performances . If " In Cold Blood " and Capote 's effect on life , literature and truth matters as much as scholars say , then it takes guts as well as talent to portray the truth , or a version of the truth , that is not the rank , cowardly lie drawn up from the fathoms of Capote 's own abyss .  
1	  i found it highly intellectual and artistic in every way ! i felt that the script was conveying all the things i feel physically and emotionally when i got home from work and watched , it . this is a tribute to cinema in the highest form and format . holy guacamole ! how i wish those days would come again . i tried putting a bubble window on the side of my car ( honda civic 1984 ) , but the vacuum formed muffin trays didn't quite cut it . also in my civic , sexual positions are limited and are not supported by water bed as is brilliantly depicted in ' the van ' . ' the van ' is of the utmost side splitting hilarity and can even substitute for porn if you watch some scenes privately . i highly anticipate that Sam Grossman ( the director ) has achieved his opus . Ratings john : * 1/2 Sam : *  
0	  First off to get my own personal feelings out of the way let me start by saying that I hate so called comedies where every single character is written and played as being so stupid that you wounder if they 're all the result of inbreeding . Now I will say this I did see the first three American Pie movies and while they weren't the most amazing movies that I 'd ever seen they were all right ( and outright masterpieces compared to the three " American Pie Presents " films ) , I still feel compelled to ask what the hell were they thinking when they made this movie ? I also have a few other questions too . Who thought that this was an acceptable use of studio funds and production resources ? who approved the final script ( and what was that person smoking when they approved it ) ? And lastly why did anyone think that it deserved to be released into theaters where the average cost of admission is between 10 and 15 dollars depending on where you live when it should have gone straight to the discount bin at Blockbuster or Wal Mart ? There is so much wrong with this movie that I can't write a really comprehensive review of it because it would exceed the maximum allowed words on this forum so I 'll just touch on the biggest things wrong with it . The plot is generic uninspired and stupid and characters are all about as interesting as watching paint dry for eighty minutes but the biggest thing that I can see wrong with this movie is the acting . While most of the cast are talentless no namers who will probably be forgotten in a few years , the one and only big name in this movie is Eugene Levy who spends almost all of the time he is on screen with this knowing smirk on his face that says to the viewer " I know this isn't funny and I 'm wasting my talents but hey I 'm getting payed for it so who cares " he doesn't even try to make any of his jokes funny ( he really deserves better than this garbage ) . As I mentioned above most of the rest of the cast are horrible even though some of them have been in some really great TV shows , Tyrone Savage ( from the classic Canadian series Wind At My Back ) plays a character who is so unbearable unlikeable and irritating ( there are things that he could teach to tropical skin diseases ) that you almost wish he 'd die a slow and painful death on screen , Christopher McDonald ( NCIS , Law & Order ) just hangs around on screen and wastes what talent he does have by being in this film . Maybe the next film in this series will just be a soft core porn with a story line so they can get around the MPAA and get an R rating this movie goes all out with pointless nudity vulgarity and pointlessly offencive sexual content that it should have gotten the X rating ( the ratings board must have been drunk or on drugs when they reviewed this film for its rating ) . It 's interesting that twenty five years ago when Wes Craven submitted A Nightmare On Elm Street to the MPAA for a rating review they forced him to cut twenty five seconds of footage ( I believe that it was part of a death scene that had a silicone casting of a breast in it ) to avoid getting an X rating and he had no other choice but to do it or the film wouldn't have been released , but this kind of needlessly offensive trash can get the R rating today because it 's all done in the name of comedy , if this movie was a drama or horror film with this kind of content there would have been a huge stink over the content and it would havegotten the dreaded X rating . The last thing that really annoys me is the writing , this movie is written to play out like the wet dream of some twelve year old kid with an extremely overactive sexual imagination its quite juvenile and extraordinarily crass , nearly every expository situation that is supposed to move the corpse that this movie calls a plot along is so telegraphed that any intelligent viewer can see it coming a mile away and and the so called characters are just stereotypes of stereotypes of stereotypes , never mind the often repulsive sexual references and constant unnecessary scenes of deviant sexual behavior it feels like this film was written by some incompetent first year hack in a low rent film school script writing class . the long and short of it is its time to kill this series before it gets any stupider more crass and offensive , this pie is filled with road apples .  
0	  In a summer that also boasted such repugnant stinkers as Snakes on a Plane and The Da Vinci Code , that 's a pretty bold statement . But I stand by it nonetheless . Superman Returns , like King Kong 6 months before it , is overlong , hyper-indulgent and with CGI up to the eyeballs . My God , this stuff is doing my head in . Richard Donner had the idea of ' keep it real ' for his 2 outings . And I do find his approach to the special and optical effects to be the most appropriate . Brian Singer bombards us with so much CGI that it really takes you out of the story and constantly reminds you that you are watching a wannabe blockbuster that thinks that the only way to impress an audience is to spend $ 250 million ( a totally irresponsible amount of money ) on obnoxious visual effects that don't live up to the hype . We 've seen everything and been everywhere that CGI can take us . There 's no real atmosphere or involvement in this . And for a film that is 95 % made up of this crap .. well you figure it out . I 've read so many reviews from fanboy critics about how the movie has ' soul ' or ' a human heart ' or ' tender character moments ' . Puh-lease ! We 've already had brooding superheros silently screaming ' you 'd love me if you knew who I am ' dozens of times already in recent years and SR offers absolutely NOTHING new in this regard . Even the plot is recycled garbage . Lex Luthor ( a seriously mis-cast and hammy Kevin Spacey ) plotting to destroy the landmass of America was done in the first film already ! And , well .. that 's your lot ! It 's amazing that they managed to draw out this junk to 2.5 painful hours ! Even if the cast were likable it would make it less unbearable . But Brandon Routh has the on screen personality of a mahogany hat-stand , Kate Bosworth is completely unconvincing as a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist , James Marsden is 250 % wooden , as usual and Kevin Spacey really needs to either fire his agent or acquire some better judgement . The only cast member I liked was the lovely Parker Posey . But I 'm into weird-looking girls . Every year films like this get bigger and more bombastic . Pretty soon we 'll have $ 300 million films . Studios need to realise that maybe they should start looking down instead of looking up . For all the money that Warner spent on this pile of crap , for all the resources that this movie cost to make .. was it worth it ? In my opinion , certainly not ! This garbage has put me of Superman for life !  
1	  I just want to say that I am so glad somebody finally spilled the beans on this movie . Bravo " The Spaz " , Bravo ! This movie is a ridiculous farce of film-making . Especially for a student film ! I just want to give credit to the Spazz for taking the absurd amount of time a care to find such a rare picture , and then TO COMMENT ON IT ! Most people I know don't have that kind of time , especially so few will end of reading it . Kudos to you sir ! Anyway , the movie follows a thin storyline that is at the least unbelievable and just plain silly . I understand the idea behind creating a satire of Charlie 's Angels but why hire such atrocious actresses ! Also , what kind of director has himself act , write , produce and also edit the picture ! Choose one job and put all your love into it man ! It 's such a shame because I hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush . Again , thanks to the Spazz for pulling back the curtain on this film , people like you are a rare find .  
1	  Most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life , ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog . The Tim Burton Batmans had it , as did ( in an even more grotesque manner ) Sin City . With Dick Tracy producer / director / star Warren Beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework . Like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures - only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker Bonnie and Clyde - Dick Tracy is filled , joyfully , with archetypes and bright , primary colors , where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities . Villains like The Stooge , Shoulders , Lips , The Brow , Mumbles , the Blank , Pruneface , Spud . Chester Gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles , and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass . The film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously . If , at the time , movies like Batman and ( underrated ) Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comic-book outline , Dick Tracy is more ' old-school ' . It 's a story of cops and crooks , or rather A cop , detective Tracy as he tries to bust Big Boy ( Al Pacino , in what is arguably his BIGGEST performance to date , and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style ) , but with no such luck . There 's also a little kid , called simply the Kid ( Charlie Korsmo , who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than would 've been imagined ) , and Tracy 's love interest in Tess . And then there 's the nightclub ' dame ' ( Madonna , who probably doesn't give any kind of great acting performance , but maybe that suits the role fine , and she sings excellently when called upon ) , who wont testify unless Tracy admits feelings he doesn't have for her . Then there 's convoluted dealings with taking Tracy down , and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voice . Meantime , as if doing an impersonation of a Howard Hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions , Dick Tracy adds on the wink-and-nod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes . It 's a wonder to look at this world , which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers ( i.e. Sin City , which can be justifiably compared to Beatty 's film ) . We 're driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line , or whatever there is of it , in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old . I 'm almost reminded of the Cotton Club during these sequences , as story , music , detail , and a few BIG punches and gun-shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said , which , actually , isn't more than it needs to . And there 's a heap-load of catchy dialog from the script ( one of my favorites : " the enemy of my enemy is .. my enemy " , plus any of Pacino 's references to other figures in quotes ) . Revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater ( and only remembering little bits ) , Dick Tracy is a hard-boiled fantasy to the finest degree . It 's filled with good cheer for the kids , and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comic-book movies ( i.e. PG-13 fare ) , and for the adults its throw-back central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle . Even Dustin Hoffman hams it up , and he barely says an audible word !  
0	  Please , someone stop Ben Stiller from acting in ANY movie . Write the studios , hell , write your local congressman even . I 've gotten more laughs going to a funeral then I have watching ANY Stiller flick . Jack Black tries to make something about a comedy about disappearing dog crap , and Christopher Walken , perhaps on of the greatest actors of his generation , simply looks embarrassed to be there . Stiller is his unfunny self , but now even with someone to bail him out , proves that he is way overrated as a comic . It 's no wonder why this movie tanked badly , and was available of the dollar movie theaters after only a handful of weeks . I warn you , and you must warn your friends , Do not watch this flick , it is just awful , worst then Gothika ( personally , i 'd never thought i 'd say that ) , worst the Plan 9 , Worst the Ishtar , worst then The Golden Child . Please Hollywood , quit allowing Ben Stiller in your movies , he 's not funny , he 's a god awful actor , and he 's bringing others down with him . The following film was ranked 1 because there are no negative scores allowed , so while the board says one , I 'll give it a Zero .  
0	  This movie starts out with an execution of a practitioner of witchcraft and his mistress . His head is chopped off and buried separately of his body .. sounds like " The Thing that wouldn't die " doesn't it ? Well it does play out a little like that , but once the body is reunited with the head , all the interesting and gruesome deaths are done and the movie moves very slowly . I mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and I kept thinking " When is it going to end " ? The characters in the movie are idiots for the most part and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid . The villain is also very bad as he is slow moving and really you wonder how he manages to do anything considering he is afraid of jewelery . The only thing to keep you watching after the head is reattached is the fact that there are so many boobs being flashed that you really begin to lose track . Still I want to see a horror movie , not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie it is way to slow moving with way to many slow stretches to be even somewhat enjoyable . And don't read the back of the box as it made it out like there were flesh eating zombies attacking the town , there isn't .. only a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily repelled they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless . So for the most part I say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap .  
1	  This was a delightful presentation . Hemo ( blood ) as a Greek god was so well played by the animation with vanity , arrogance , snobbish superiority and innocent wonder . The quote ( or scene ) I recall vividly is when Hemo tires of " all this plumbing .. you haven't learned my secrets at all " and threatens to storm out , the Scientist answers him in a single word " Thalassa " - salt water which horrifies the Fiction Writer but mollifies Hemo and segues so neatly into the chemical aspects of blood . Such a splendid blend of entertainment and information make this a classic as fresh and engrossing today as the day it was released . Stimulating the interest and imagination is fundamental to teaching kids to love learning .  
0	  James Bond in the wilderness ? Well , that 's the way it looks : Pierce Brosnan is after all best known as Bond in " Tommorrow Never Dies " ( 1997 ) and " Golden Eye " ( 1995 ) - both shot prior to this release . Frankly , the film 's two leads are both badly miscast , with Brosnan turning in the marginally more convincing performance , and with Annie Galipeau ( as Pony , Grey Owl 's love interest ) having to battle with carelessly-written dialogue . The two aunts , on the other hand are perfect . But the film is not about aunts . It is about the wilds of the Canadian wilderness . And while the photography may be pretty , there is no grit to the harsh reality of living in the wilds . Annie Galipeau , as Pony , just fails to be convincing , unfortunately , because I really wanted to believe in her . She was a relatively inexperienced twenty-year-old on this film , and it could have worked , but Richard Attenborough was maybe just not tough enough on her . He makes her look vulnerable , which of course she is .. but in the wrong sort of way . But one thing for sure , she appears picture-perfect throughout . But mascara and eyebrow thickener in the wilderness ? It just doesn't fit , especially as she only ever seems to walk forest trials with Bond ( sorry , Grey Owl ) , and use photo-ops for kissing close-ups . I 've lived with forest people in the Pacific North West , and they simply don't look this pretty and stay so sweet while fighting for survival . Which brings me to another point : the film fails to evoke the period in which it is set : the 1930s . I put the blame here largely on a lack-lustre script that is keen on preaching at the expense of dramatic arc , plot points and those small details that can evoke period through action . William Nicholson wrote the screenplay , and his latest offering , " Elizabeth , the Golden Age " opened three days ago , so I do hope there is an improvement . Yes , I 've read the comments others have posted , but I 'm not convinced . A lot of potential , but mishandled and even maybe ill-conceived . If it had had a religious film , it would have been panned , but because it preaches environmentalism , the film remains somewhat above criticism , since it is " politically correct . " Sorry , for all that , I don't buy it . Amen .  
0	  David Chase 's " The Sopranos " is perhaps the most over-praised television show in recent memory . Not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion , it 's devoid of a soul . As anyone reading likely knows already , James Gandolfini * IS * Tony Soprano , a big , fat a * hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b * tch of a wife , and two bratty , sh * t-brained kids living in - you guessed it - the armpit of America ( that 's New Jersey , by the way ) . Not only is Tony a womanizing adulterer , he 's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag , with a crew of " Saturday Night Live " skit-worthy caricatures for subordinates . It 's not the fact that Tony is a piece of sh * t mobster that offends me ( and apparently only me ) . Allowing characters to be who and what they are , without judgment , is something American TV hardly allows . But Chase - and his entourage of money-gorged , Emmy-gored writers - have not simply allowed us to observe Tony and his crew as they behave , nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action / reaction reality of ( even obviously fictionalized ) organized crime ( a la " The Godfather " ) . Instead , Chase glorifies and endorses his characters ' greedy , violent , and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that Tony , his wife , and even his hair-brained psychologist do week after week ( or should I say month after month . Or is it year after year ? It seems like the show 's paltry 13-episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse ) . Much has been made of the series ' refusal to adhere to " network " structure , with plot lines that go nowhere , and characters that pop-up and disappear like backyard vermin . But if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure , why does it always feel like I 'm watching a soap-opera ? Tired mob clichés , bored housewives , self-serving , irredeemable characters AND plots that go nowhere . More than ever , I can see why so many Americans of Italian heritage are p * ssed at this show . It 's enough to make you want to curl up with a good book ( Danté 's " Inferno " springs to mind ) . People on IMDb love to claim that there 's nothing good on television , and therefore " The Sopranos " is a breath of fresh air . Are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch " The Shield " ? ( It 's included in Basic , ya know ) . How about the ( still good ) " The West Wing " ? Or the brilliantly acted ( if erratically written ) " Boston Legal " ? What about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades , " Arrested Development " ? And lest we forget that we live in an age of DVDs - nobody * has * to watch * anything * new . I 'd much rather shell out $ 40 for an over-priced boxed set of , well , pretty much * anything * , than give HBO $ 10 a month ( or $ 80 a DVD set ! ) to continue to prove how much of a hack-factory it can be . You want good television ? Watch " Homicide : Life on the Street . " Or " Murder One " . Or " Picket Fences " . Or even Chase 's prior show , " Northern Exposure . " If you 're already among " The Sopranos " ' s legion of brain-washed fans and critics , it 's too late for you . But if not , leave Tony and his worthless kin where they all belong - rotting with the fishes . ( " Sleeping " would be way too kind )  
1	  Yes , it 's flawed - especially if you 're into Hollywood films that demand a lot of effects , a purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot , and you can't actually think for yourself . Roeg 's films are for the intelligent film-goer , and Insignificance is a perfect example . The characterizations are brilliant , the story is excellent , but , like all Nic Roeg 's films - it has you thinking on every level about aspects of reality that would never have dawned on you before . His films always make you think , and personally , I like that in a film . So don't expect to come away from watching this film and feeling all happy-happy , because it 's likely you 'll be disappointed . But I think it 's excellent .  
0	  Probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this : 1 . They might not have read the book . 2 . They might enjoy gore and violence in a film . 3 . They might be very young and therefore not understand the violence . 4 . People might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book . 5 . There are sure to be many other reasons not covered here . The only thing I liked about this film is the song " ' Bright Eyes " . If perchance , you happen to be one of those people who has read the book , enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence , you are sure not to like this . Otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this . Like in the book , a rabbit called Fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come . Only a few rabbits - including his brother Hazel - believe him and they set out on a dangerous journey to find a new place to live ..  
1	  This is one of those unfortunate films that suffered an even more sad , unfortunate death at the box office . I saw this film at a local art cinema , in revival form , shortly after it tanked in mainstream cinemas . It certainly deserves to be approached a second time ( or even a third ) . Sandra B. takes it to the limit by doing spoken word & taking on some well known songs in this piece ( her version of Hank William 's ' I 'm So Lonesome I Could Cry ' could easily move you to tears ) . Maybe someday , audiences will be ready to take this film a bit more seriously ( but not without some well placed laughs , too ) . The film moves at a brisk pace ( thanks to some nice editing ) , so that some viewers will not find it stale & boring . Perhaps a revival is just down the pipeline .  
0	  Oh dear lord . This movie .. It was horrible . I am a HUGE fan of horror movies . And most of the time , horror movies other people say are bad , I like . The actor who played ' Scarecrow ' was amazing , I will say that . But this plot was awful . It made no sense ! It had way too much gore , and an unnecessary ( and revolting ) sex scene at the beginning . I do believe the director was trying to be ' shocking ' or whatnot , but it just came out awful . To add to the pile of festering crap they called a plot , the actors ( besides ' scarecrow ' ) we 're awful , and I cared so little about them that I soon forgot who was who . In conclusion , this movie made me sick . If you can avoid watching this movie in anyway , please do .  
1	  BSG is one of my all time favourite TV series . I was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to it 's final season . It was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was ! As soon as I noticed the pilot on Hulu I knew exactly what I was in for just by the title - Caprica ! Although , some things don't add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed . There were no mention about the holobands in Battlestar Galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe I haven't got far enough into the series for them to explain why . I recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe , technology , and alternate fantasies of our world . This show is very interesting and will have you wanting to watch more !  
1	  This Showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4.5 ; I gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars . After reading the viewer comments , I was surprised at how many folks expected this movie to be a comedy . Yeah , I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy / Drama under Genre . That sure is misleading , isn't it ? Fortunately , I saw the movie before logging onto this website so I did not have that expectation . In fact , based on the synopsis of what I heard , I fully expected it to simply be a Drama . I 'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes . Another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much ' character-driven ' . ' Driving Miss Daisy ' is an example of another character-driven movie that comes to mind . Someone 's previous comment complained about a boring trial . Tom 's ( Danny Glover ) work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie . That is , how he was engineering the upward social climb of his family - or his personal troops , if you will . However , they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to Greenwich and move ' up ' in the world . Tom 's obsession became a compulsion . He proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood . His chagrin when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color . It was because of everything the ' interloper ' represented ; everything that Tom had left behind . In essence , Tom had become an Oreo cookie : Black on the outside but White on the inside . The last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most powerfully written , directed and acted ( by Whoopi Goldberg ) I have ever had the pleasure to witness . I realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door ( don't want to give it away ) . The climax is verbal and Whoopi delivers it . I am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs Tom which college Tom - Two is going to or when she releases it , all in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up . Nevertheless , the denouement is great . You know that life on that street will never be the same . My favorite kind of character-driven flick : people go through problems , some pain , do their dance , they grow , they change , and life goes on . As an audience member , I may learn something or be inspired .  
1	  Another entry in the " holiday horror " category that fills the shelves of your local video store . The * spoiler * " wronged nerdy teen taking revenge on the ' cool ' kids who wronged him " plot will of course be familiar to those who 've watched it before . And those who 've seen it before will probably watch it again ; those who are expecting Ingmar Bergman and will subsequently become indignant about their wasted time should just skip it . Marilyn Manson on the soundtrack and David Boreanaz , Denise Richards and Katherine Heigl as eye candy-go with the flow and enjoy it . Oh , and I loved the creepy mask .  
1	  In a little town in Montana two brothers grow up . One of them is Norman ( Craig Sheffer ) , the other is Paul ( Brad Pitt ) . Their father is Reverend Maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion , and the lessons of fly-fishing . In this movie fly-fishing represents life , a little . The story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action . Probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen , but about the message . Some things do happen though . Norman goes to Dartmouth to study . After six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named Jessie ( Emily Lloyd ) and he is invited to teach in Chicago . Paul has become a reporter and is known as the " fishing reporter " . He is famous and it seems he has a nice life , but he drinks a little too much and gambles too much . The movie is very well directed , it has a nice score and all of the actors are good . The most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography . The mountains , the woods and the river all look very beautiful . If the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch . Fortunately there is more .  
0	  A group of us watched this film are were really disgusted . We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character Jo wasn't on ( it 's not like the writers / producers could do anything about that ) . The writing was poor , the script was sub-par . What REALLY annoyed us : 1 . When the two guys realized they were both dating Natalie , they didn't just leave they put up with that stupid ( and ultimately degrading ) contest - but only because they were macho competing guys , not because they really wanted Natalie . 2 . Despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion , Natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him ? ( and there was no foreshadowing that he was really a better guy , it 's as if the writers flipped a coin and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film ) . 3 . Blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children , she blissfully agrees with him .  
1	  Mother Night is one of my favorite novels and going to see this I was expecting a huge disappointment . Instead I got a film that perfectly portrays the irony , humor , elequence , and above all else the crushing sadness of Vonnegut 's novel . This is certainly Nolte 's best preformance to date . He captures the defeat and selfloathing of Howard Cambell Jr. consistently from the subtle intonations of his speech to the held back tears behind his eyes . Alan Arkin is absolutly hilarious as George Kraft . Sherryl Lee is haunting in her detachment from reality as Cambell 's young lover . John Goodman is understated and more than effective as Cambell 's " Blue Fairy Godmother . " This Pinnocioesque story of Cambell trying to be his own ideal hero and unwittingly becoming his ideal tragic villian is a mature and vivid look into what we are as people . And aside from that , it is one of the most deeply romantic films I have ever come across . Cambell is the incarnation of both foolish and wise love . And at the films sastifyingly painful conclusion , he finally learns what it means to be a real boy as his Blue Fairy Godmother grants him his wish . And he realizes that .. well , watch the movie and you 'll see . Mother Night is without a doubt in my mind one of the best films ever made . It is a beautiful poetic story that digs deep within our emotions and is completely faithful to its original author .  
0	  While it 's early to say how the series will evolve , I can say that the pilot was less than I thought it would be . There is still potential for the series , however . Of course when I first saw Voyager I thought it had potential , too - but was sorely disappointed . My gut tells me Enterprise won't be as bad as Voyager , however . As for the impressions of the pilot .. The pilot had some good ideas and good themes . I liked the introduction . The show 's opening credits were interesting , with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song . Scott Bakula is excellent in the role of captain . Where it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the " feel " of setting out on a grand adventure . The plot of the episode itself was more a " generic " Trek story with the themes of " exploration " and " first step towards space " merely subplot and subtext . Were you to edit out the references to this being the first deep space mission , the plot would be hard to differentiate between the eras of Enterprise , TOS or TNG . The central plot didn't reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series . The plot of launching the first mission would have been grand enough without the " action " . Instead of isolated references to the newness of exploration , they could have been the story . Get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it ( oh , for a TV show that once again would make us THINK ) . Make us feel the excitement of " the wind " and being on " the sea " instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay . There was WAY too much gunplay . We had the feeling more that humans were the " freshmen " in an established school . New kids on the block , as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe . Sadly , the Klingons landed on our doorstep instead of us finding them . That meeting could have been far more historic and far more sociological . Just how DO two such different societies interact ? Don't just hint about it , SHOW it ! I had to think of it more as ` Trek with an akward crew and limited technology ' as opposed to ` the first brave steps into the unknown ' . I wanted to see something newer and fresher . The series promises to have a new concept but so far I haven't seen this new , great concept . I will conclude with reiterating the sentiment that the series has potential . There are some interesting characters . Bakula is wonderful . Blalock has potential . The overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw Kirk in a world before Apollo 11 . If only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme , we will have a show which will create new legends . You shoot an arrow into the air .. Good luck Capt . Archer . To the producers : TAKE MORE RISKS AND MAKE US * THINK * ! :-)  
1	  Remarkable , disturbing film about the true-life , senseless , brutal murder of a small-town family , along with the aftermath , and examination of the lives of the killers , Dick Hickok and Perry Smith . No matter how much time goes by , or how dated this film may look , it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as this . This really traces multiple tragedies : The tragedy , brutality and senselessness of the murder of the Clutter family , a decent farm family in small-town Holcomb , Kansas ; and the wasted , brutal and sad lives of Hickok and Smith . An interesting point is made in the film : that neither of these two immature , scared , petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone . But , together , they created a dangerous , murderous collective personality ; one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them . They push each other along a road of " proving " something to each other . That they were man enough to do it , to carry it out ; neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big " score " ; an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led . These were two grown-up children , who live in a criminal 's world of not backing down from dares ; who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness . in this instance , these needs carried right through to the murder of the Clutters . The film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the Clutter family , but the point is made . These were respected , law-abiding , small-town people , who didn't deserve this terrifying fate . The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of Hickok and Smith . Perry Smith , whose early life was filled with security and love , but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path . Hickok , poor and left pretty much to his own devices , not able to see how he fit in , using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with . An interesting , and maybe the first , look at capital punishment , and what ends we hope to achieve . Is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us , or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these ? Is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit , operating under the radar , believing they fool everyone they come into contact with ? To be deterred , you must believe it 's possible you will be caught . Is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught ? ; who have committed hundreds of petty crimes , and got away with them ? This was supposed to be a " cinch " , " no witnesses " . When caught , Hickok finds he can't charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks . Smith , who believes he deserves such a fate anyway , who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done , willingly tells the story when he learns that Hickok has cowardly caved in . Hickok blinked first . A silly game of chicken between two immature , emotionally damaged , dangerous men . Fascinating psychological thriller , telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nation 's history . Stunning portrayals by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson . These roles made their careers .  
1	  William Hurt may not be an American matinee idol anymore , but he still has pretty good taste in B-movie projects . Here , he plays a specialist in hazardous waste clean-ups with a tragic past tracking down a perennial loser on the run - played by former pretty-boy Weller - who has been contaminated with a deadly poison . Current pretty-boy Hardy Kruger Jr - possibly more handsome than his dad - is featured as Weller 's arrogant boss in a horrifying sequence at a chemical production plant which gets the story moving . Natasha McElhone is a slightly wacky government agent looking into the incident who provides inevitable & high-cheekboned love interest for hero Hurt . Michael Brandon pops up to play a slimy take-no-prisoners type whose comeuppance you can't wait for . The Coca-Cola company wins the Product Placement award for 2000 as the soft drink is featured throughout the production , shot lovingly on location in a wintery picture-postcard Hungary .  
1	  I 'm on the opposite end of the previous comment . First of all , I don't think this was intended to be a straight sequel to " The Jerk " . I mean , it 's not titled " The Jerk 2 " .. it 's " The Jerk , Too " , which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same , it actually revolves around a completely different person . Think about it : Virtually no connection to the previous movie , other than character names ; a totally different story ; different cast ; and the fact that it 's a partial musical . I say give this movie some credit . It does have plenty of laughs in it .. Mark Blankfield at his prime .  
1	  All films made before 1912 really need to be viewed with a sense of time and place . In 1894 , the Lumiere-family men [ father : Antoine ( 1840-1911 ) , sons : Auguste and Louis ] owned and managed a factory that manufactured photographic plates and paper . Not a small enterprise ; the factory had more than 200 employees who received pension and social security benefits - innovative for that time . It was located at Montplaisir in the suburbs of Lyon , France . What caused Louis Lumiere to become interested in building a Cinematagraph , in 1894 , remains open for speculation . My suggestion is that the appearance of the Edison organization 's Kinetoscope ( peep-show machine ) , in Paris during the fall of 1894 , provided the catalyst . W.K.L. Dickson , of Edison 's staff , invented a motion-picture camera about the size of an upright piano that was patented in February 1893 . It was electrically operated ( using power from from heavy storage batteries . This massive machine pumped celluloid film strip ( newly developed by the Eastman company ) past a lens at about 40 frames-per-second ( fps ) . It was ensconced , as an almost immovable object , in the " Black Maria " ( essentially the first movie studio . ) The Kinetescope machines showed staged presentations ( less than one-minute long ) that were filmed in this studio . During 1894 , Louis Lumiere applied himself to the task of inventing a moving-picture camera . He had determined that , even at 16 fps on celluloid film , the persistence-of-vision of the human eye / brain would allow for normal motion to be perceived . His camera , dubbed the Cinematograph , was about the size of a large shoe box and was provided with a detachable film magazine that provided storage for enough film to make a shoot last about one minute when it was had cranked past the lens at 16 fps . The size and light weight , of the camera ( it could be converted into a printer or a projector by the addition of a light source ) made it portable enough that it could be taken to any location to record an event ( provided there was enough sunlight available . ) In the spring of 1895 , Louis filmed : trick-riding by some cavalry men ; a house on fire with firemen arriving and dousing the engulfed building with water ; and a number of other scenes in and around Lyon . Using a Molteni bulb , he turned the camera into a projector and presented his films to scientists assembled in the reception room of the Revue Generales des Science . The images were projected on a screen five-meters distant from the lens . The screen was stretched in a doorway between two rooms . At a meeting of professional photographers , that same year , Louis photographed the arriving delegates and the same evening showed them motion pictures of their arrival . With accolades from both the scientific and photographic communities , Louis decided to have a public exhibition of his invention by the end of the year . Since each of his films would be about one-minute long , he would need at least a dozen films to make a good presentation . For one of these films he set up his camera at the entrance to his factory , photographing the egress of employees at quitting-time . The public venue chosen by Antoine - who offered himself as the " fairground barker " for the Cinematograph - was the Salon Indien of the Grand Cafe on the boulevard des Capucines in Paris . It was a wintry Saturday night on 28 December , 1895 . As the first audience sat , they were presented with a projected view of the exterior of the Lumiere factory ( with closed gates . ) Some were chagrined that they were just going to see a routine slide show of Lumiere photographs . But then the crank on the camera / projector was turned and movement began . Louis had an innate sense for motion picture taking . This film has a beginning , a middle and an end . In the beginning , the doors are opened and people begin to leave their workplace ; during the middle , the people stream out - with many trying to ignore the camera , and the cameraman , as they seem to be happy to leave a day of labor behind them . At the end , the gates to the factory are being closed . And this was the first film projected for the entertainment of the general public .  
0	  Have you ever seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots ? No ? Me , neither . Well , I 've finally seen one in " Spring in my Hometown , " and I must confess , now I KNOW why people don't do this . The technique is " arty , " to be sure , but it 's definitely NOT ripe for public consumption . The technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters , and perhaps that might be the director 's whole intentions . I don't know , I can't read minds , and I certainly don't know enough about the director to make a judgement . But one thing about this movie that IS painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti-American sentiments . As an American , I 'm well aware of my country 's participation in the Korean War , and I 'm very well aware that we weren't always angels , but I 'll be damn if I 'll take this guy 's version of how things happened . According to this blind fool , Americans were not only at the root of the war , we were the CAUSE of the war , and we almost singlehandedly destroyed the country . Whatever , Mister Director . And I suppose you 'd still be making this film in COMMUNIST KOREA if we hadn't interfered , right ? Talk about forgetting your history . This is almost akin to making the Nazis the " good guys " while turning the Allied forces into the " bad guys . " This movie is so historically naive and so factually inaccurate that it 's almost embarrassing to watch . For a man who comes from a country that owes its very EXISTENCE to American interference , he sure comes off as high and mighty and judgemental .  
0	  If , in the first 10 minutes of this film , you don't realize that the main character , who writes a life advice column , is going to have the tables oh so cleverly turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself , then there is probably something wrong with you . The set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie , even if the rest of the movie was good ( which it isn't ) There 's almost no chemistry between the leads , and Steve Carell 's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing , not funny . It 's hard to believe Binoche 's character would have any interest in him . Then in the end it 's all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after . Isn't that great America !  
0	  This is an action Western . James Steart leads an all star cast in the scenic Northwest , which is filmed in great splendor . The scenery and costumes are great . There is action and adventure . Stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old Nothwest . The main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that Hollywood has always made into a hero . Even when this movie was made , the cynic was the stereotypical hero , and the one Stewart portrays really has few saving graces . He is kind to his two partners , and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability . However , he is so piggish to everyone else , it is hard to really care for him , or to accept him . He is much like the one dimensional spaghetti Western characters ( cut not that bad ) . Still , the minor characters are quite enjoyable . Walter Brennan , Royal Dano , Harry Morgan , and others make this worth watching .  
0	  I have not yet seen anyone slate this film and i think i may be the first . It was awful . I actually didn't watch the end of it . It was like watching a boring soap or a really good one ( all soaps are crap ) . The actors were poor and storyline was bad . The person who rated it 10/10 has no idea what he is on about . The script was awful . 2 People was in an angry conversation together involving threats and you expect the good guy to say some thing really good and beat the crap out of him but no . He says " If you do that .. I will hurt you " Hahahahaha . If comedy is your thing , watch away . Please do not watch this film because .. It 's CRAP ! Summary : Poor acting , bad fights , bad script . Don't watch ! Of course this is in my opinion .  
0	  As other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1/2 hour . However before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by Kate Capshaw , who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she 's in . Connery is fine as is Fishbourne , but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality . And the ending is simply bizarre . The film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have Thanksgiving dinner , so to compensate they added an overloud " dramatic " score . Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration , to the point where it becomes laughable . If you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see , otherwise skip it .  
0	  Wow . Some movies just leave me speechless . This was undeniably one of those movies . When I left the theatre , not a single word came to my mouth . All I had was an incredible urge to slam my head against the theatre wall to help me forget about the last hour and a half . Unfortunately , it didn't work . Honestly , this movie has nothing to recommend . The humor was at the first grade level , at best , the acting was overly silly , and the plot was astronomically far-fetched . I hearby pledge never to see an other movie starring Chris Kattan or any other cast-member of SNL .  
0	  Supposedly a " social commentary " on racism and prison conditions in the rural South of the 1970 's , " Nightmare " is full of bad Southern stereotypes , complete with phoney accents . Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American Southerners , this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly-disguised " babe in prison " movie-especially in its uncut original version . Nevertheless , acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors , in particular , does a good job of making viewers hate him-even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes . There 's also a change-of-pace role for the late Robert Reed , who appears as the lecherous warden , and Tina Louise ( previously Ginger of " Gilligan 's Island " ) made a rather believable sadistic prison guard . My grade : D.  
1	  This was the first of Panahi 's films that I have seen , I saw it at Melbourne film festival . I was totally absorbed by the different characters that he creates and how differently they react and behave compared to Aussie kids and yet on other levels how similarly . I think perhaps if more people could see movies like this , they could see people as individuals and avoid racism that can often be fueled by the fear of the unknown . There are the obvious large political differences between Oz culture and Iranian culture , but I found the more subtle differences between the characters , that this film fleshes out so successfully on screen , extremely fascinating . There are idiosyncrasies in the characters that seem to me , so unique . I found it made the characters compelling viewing .  
0	  The Crater Lake Monster is easily one of the most awful , amateurish film I 've ever seen - ranking right up there with Manos , the Hands of Fate in terms of poor acting , useless direction , and kindergarten-level production values . In this movie a silly-looking claymation / stop-motion animated dinosaur wakes up after a meteor hits a lake in Bumblebum , CA , and begins dining on the local hayseeds . In the thrilling climax , the creature , described by one local as " a giant alligator with flippers " , drags it 's ponderous bulk over the ground to chase its would-be lunch , before a bulldozer bumps it a couple of times & it dies from boredom . Every character in this moovie is a complete moron . One pointless subplot shows a hick go into a liquor store to purchase a $ 4.75 pint of Ripple ; instead of simply buying the bottle , the idiot shoots the cashier and another bystander , shoots at a cop , gets chased towards the lake , all so that he can eaten by the monster . Unfortunate close-ups of the monster reveal it to be nothing more than a piece of styrofoam . There 's a fake magician struggling with a phony British accent ( to make him seem more legit ) , two overly-bumbling redneck boat renters , some cheesy " pre-historic cave art " done in crayon , and annoying banjo-pickin ' background moosic . In one painful scene , the fake magician and his dopey wife / girlfriend / accomplice manage to pad the movie an extra 4 minutes by cowmenting on how may stars they can see in the night sky , even though it is clearly day time still . Even on constant fast-forward , this moovie hurts , and hurts bad . MooCow says call the fumigators , ' cause this cow pie really stinks ! : = 8P  
1	  What more could I say ? The Americans totally hated it because the U.S. cut was so bad , although you could detect the underlying goodwill in it . Talking about the U.S. theatrical release ( along with the newly released Blu-ray Disc version ) , it 's faster and tighter than HK cut , the background musics were all changed from the dark , grim HK musics to Hip-hop musics ; and there were a lot of gruesome scenes cut out . Though , the dubbing was a notable job given that they tried to capture the original actor 's voice and tone . But , the problem is Hak Hap ( Black Mask ) the movie was designed and meant to be dark , grim , super-disturbing and totally gruesome . Very unfortunately the U.S. release just skimmed the cream they wanted , which in return completely changed the movie 's undertone ( HK release was rated 18 + ) to be even more comical and amateurish . Now let 's talk about the original HK release . This movie is like a hidden gem , a prototype for the whole " matrix " tide and era . The fighting scenes are totally awesome even the camera works were a bit " old-school " among HK movies . However the style the movie created was a unique blend of Kungfu and pop culture . With all the leather , black costumes and decorations , this movie features a batman-like superhero in a black mask against a run of the mill gang of multinational super-soldiers lead by a punk heavy metal rock star boss . Yes it sounds like imaginations of a retarded child , but it works . It 's so impressive that the whole movie 's gonna give you nightmares featuring foreigners fighting a bloodbath battle in leather coats . In year 2002 they made a sequel which had a PG-13 rating , but without Jet Li and Liu Qing Yun . And you know how bad that was because Li and Liu were the core characters in the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship . And , did I happen to mention Francois Yip ? Her roundhouse kick was totally cool , even cooler than the villain boss because she didn't use a stuntman for all the fighting . Did I mention she was also smoking hot ? Anyway , there are a lot of things to like about the movie . However , the movie also suffered from a lot of problems . First off , it 's a mediocre script made at its best potential , which means this production team deserved a better screen-writer . There are a lot climaxes in the entire 100 minutes but they often felt like far-fetched and don't totally make senses to the audiences ( US version was even worse because all the character developments were cut ) . Anyway , you can't ask too much out of a comic-inspired action movie . Also , this movie is entirely improper for children . I won't recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old . It 's saturated with disturbing contents including blood , gore , sado-maso costumes , extreme brutal violence and so on . Along with the style of the movie , it can be called a wet dream for heavy-metal rock music fans and action fans . ( the U.S. cut was milder , but if you want to see it , see the HK release for what it is . ) 7/10 . Status : inspiring , hidden , undervalued , adult .  
1	  This movie pretty much surprised me . I didn't have very high expectations for it but I was wrong . Mary & Rhoda was very funny and well written . They didn't spend too much time rehashing the past so they weren't relying on the success of the old TV show to carry the movie . Overall it was very entertaining . My girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit-com and I think I might agree with her .  
1	  Will all of you please lay the hell off Todd Sheets ! ? ! Let 's give you $ 30,000 to make a movie and see what you come up with ! The guy got 735 zombies and a regular cast to work for FREE ! Sure the acting is laughable at times . Yes the make-up is not greatest you 'll ever see . But it 's not the worst either , if you want to see that , go watch Zombie Nation with it 's raccoon zombies . This is pure , good old fashioned Guerilla Film-making ! Todd is a consummate professional , and an all around nice guy . There are holes in the plot , yes . The plot does seem far-fetched . But what the hell , I still love this movie . I wish Todd Sheets would come out of hiding and do the remake of this that he was going to . If anyone has ever tried to make a movie , they know that just finishing it , is an achievement in and of itself .  
0	  I really have problems rating this movie . It is directed brilliantly , there is obviously a lot of money in it . Gere and Danes are intense ( although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up ) , editing and cinematography are excellent . On the other hand , it is one of those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes , and , yes , one cannot help but wonder how many copycats will such a movie inspire . In purely artistic terms , it is a 9 , but I really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie ..  
1	  Shocking , well-made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces . Small town doctor tries to discover who , or what , is committing a series of violent sexual murders . Incubus is a tight mystery , with some horrific murder sequences , that builds to an off-beat and eerie climatic twist . The murder scenes are intense and gory , so this isn't a film for the squeamish ! The direction of John Hough , along with a bizarre music score , combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film . It also carries a kind of Gothic vibe as well . Nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight . The cast isn't bad either . The great John Cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town . Also good are the performances of Kerrie Keane as the local reporter , Helen Hughes as the town historian , and Duncan McIntosh as a tormented psychic teen . All around Incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re-discovered and re-evaluated . * out of *  
1	  THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is proof that the great genius Orson Welles could direct a " mainstream " movie if he wanted to . By comparison to his other , more artistic works , this film has only a moderate amount of craftiness , and almost no esoteric elements . The exception being , of course , the final scene in the hall of mirrors , widely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of film . It alone is worth the cost of a rental . The sweet surprise was the superb acting by the beautiful Rita Hayworth . Her acting during the beginning and middle of the film is so excellent , she made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters . Even the great Mr. Welles .  
1	  Although at one point I thought this was going to turn into The Graduate , I have to say that The Mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman . I 'm so glad this is a British film because Hollywood never would have done it , and even if they had , they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters . The story is revealed slowly and realistically . The acting is superb , the characters are believably flawed , and the dialogue is sensitive . I tried many times to predict what was going to happen , and I was always wrong , so I was very intrigued by the story . I highly recommend this movie . And I must confess , I 'll forever look at my mom in a different light !  
1	  I 've loved all of Cream 's work , even as there is such a small and precious catalog of work to take hold . Even when they go for as long as twenty minutes with some of their songs ( Spoonful and Toad off of Wheels of Fire are prime examples ) still rock the socks off of more than half of any given rock act working today . This power to gel on stage is given one of the most anticipate rock band reunions ever with their Royal Albert Hall shows last year . They may have gotten older , as have their fans , but the energy is still there , with the great arrangements of classic blues songs as well as their own . The renditions of White Room , Badge , Politician , Spoonful , Sunshine of Your Love , not one seems to miss a beat . Clapton 's solos have a formation that he sometimes doesn't have when on stage with his solo band . Ginger Baker , enough said . Jack Bruce is sturdy enough with his vocals still with a kind of power that Clapton could never get on his own . Bottom line , if you want to see what were the best shows you wish you had seen last year ( well , some may have seen them ) , it 's all on this DVD , with cool special features .  
1	  Diane Keaton gave an outstanding performance in this rather sad but funny story which involved quite a few young people and their deep dark secrets . Diane Keaton , ( Natalie ) , " The Family Stone " , ' 05 , who had an only daughter and loved her beyond words can describe . She always called her and told her , " Surrender Dorothy " , which was an expression used in the ' Wizard of Oz ' , 1939 . A sudden car accident occurs and Natalie gets herself deeply involved with her daughter 's friends and lovers . As Natalie investigates , the more truths she finds out about herself and her real relationship with her daughter . Great film to view and enjoy , especially all the good acting from all the supporting actors .  
1	  As a kid , I loved this game . I played it a zillion times during Spring 1993 with my friend Andrew . I used to play Axel or Blaze and he would be Adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored . Then Streets of Rage 2 came out . And we quickly forgot that this one even existed . You play as ex-cops Axel Stone , Adam or Blaze Fielding , who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way . There are 8 levels to work thru in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil Mr X. Beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun . Level 4 ( The Bridge ) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river . You even have the chance to become Mr. X 's right hand man at the end of the game ( at a price ) . This leads to the ' bad ending ' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate . Exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to Mr. X , but never mind . Streets of Rage also has truly fantastic music . The composer Yuzo Koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the Sega Genesis . The main theme , Level One , Level 4 and Final Boss are standout tunes . As a Wii owner I am proud to have this forever on my console . But with Streets of Rage 2 also available , it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete . Pros : Average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic-book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game . Great tunes . Easy to get into and hard to put down . Cons : Vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex Streets of Rage 2 . Poor enemy AI . Baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat . This is especially infuriating with the Level 5 boss . Lack of combo moves . Lack of decent weapons . Bad guy models are repeated far too often . Graphics B- Sound A- Gameplay B- Lasting Appeal B-  
0	  This movie was the most horrible movie watching experience i have ever had to endure , and what is worse is the fact that i had to watch it , and didn't have the opportunity to stop it because it was for school ! Admittedly , the storyline was decent .. but i found the acting terrible ! The exception was Marianne Jean-Baptiste , i thought her performance was wonderful . She was the only highlight , without her , i doubt i would have been able to bear watching the film . Every time i hear somebody say " daarling " i cringe ! i nearly attacked a customer the other day because they said " it " . It made me remember one of the worst one and a half hours of my life ! ( i apologise if this has offended anybody , i am only expressing my opinion )  
1	  Last night I finished re-watching " Jane Eyre " ( 1983 ) , the BBC mini-series adapted from Charlotte Bronte 's Gothic romance novel which is deservingly a classic of English literature with Timothy Dalton ( my favorite James Bond ) as Mr. Edward Rochester and Zelah Clarke , as Jane Eyre , a poor orphaned 18-year-old girl , a governess at Mr. Rochester 's estate , Thornfield . " Jane Eyre " has been one of my most beloved books since I was an 11-years-old girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words , " This book is amazing " and so it was and I have read it dozens of times and I am still not tired of it . Its beautiful language , refined , fragrant , and surprisingly fresh , the dialogs , and above all , two main characters , and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers . " Jane Eyre " has been adapted to TV and big screen many times , 18 according to IMDb . The actors as famous and marvelous as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles , William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg , George C. Scott and Susannah York , Ciarán Hinds and Samantha Morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society , laws , religion , by the differences in age , backgrounds , experiences , and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years . Of all these films I 've only seen one , 300 minutes long BBC version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where Timothy Dalton who frequently plays dark , brooding characters did not just play Edward Rochester brilliantly and with class , he WAS Mr. Rochester - sardonic , vibrant , the force of nature , powerful , passionate , sexy , and tormented master of Thornfield . Zelah Clarke was also convincing as sweet , gentle , intelligent and strong Jane who feels deeply and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning , and quiet but firm willpower . Added on September 17 , 2007 : During the last two weeks , I 've seen five " Jane Eyre " movies and it was a wonderful experience . There is something to admire in every adaptation of " Jane Eyre " even if not all of them are completely successful . This version is still my favorite " Jane Eyre " film .  
1	  I had read an article about Dan Jansen 's Olympic and personal journey before seeing this movie . I 'm always intrigued by a story of hope and overcoming life altering events , and this was no exception . The background of the characters that is provided gives you a sense of the family 's closeness and how they positively affected each others ' lives . I can't speak to the accuracy of specific details in this movie , it is customary to take some creative license when organizing a script . However , the spirit of Dan and his family is what matters here . Its a worthwhile movie of a story that should be told . I felt empathy for the characters and cheered at the end .  
0	  while watching this movie I got sick . I have been grewing up with Pippi and every time was a real pleasure . when my wife came to Sweden she was looking at the oldies and had a real good laugh . but this American version should be renamed and never be shown again . it is terrible from beginning to it 's end . how can they manage to make it soo bad . well I guess someone blames the translation ha ha ha .. but they are never close to Pippi . may this movie never been seen again and never sent out on a broadcast . burn the movie and save the kids . if you want to look at Pippi then look at the original movie and have a good laugh . WE LOVE PIPPI INGER NILSSON , sorry Tami Erin you will never stand up to be Pippi .. Oh yes .. when read the " spoilers " explanation , " ' spoiling ' a surprise and robbing the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film . " well I guess the director stands for this .. you are looking at this movie at your own risk .. it is really a waste of time ..  
0	  Jason Lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation , but the movie just fails to make a connect . Perhaps because Julia Stiles character seems awkward as the conniving and sexy soon to be cousin-in-law . Maybe it is because she and Selma Blair 's characters should have been cast the opposite way . ( Selma Blair seems more conniving than Julia would be ) . Either way this movie is yet another Hollywood trivialization of a possibly real world situation ( that being getting caught with your pants out at your bachelor party not stooping your cousin ) , which while having promise fails to deliver . There are some laughs to be sure and the cast ( even if miscast ) do their best with sub grade material which doesn't transcend its raunchy topic . So instead of getting a successful raunch fest ( ie Animal House or American Pie ) we are left with a middle ground of part humor and part stupidity ( ala Meatballs 2 or something ) .  
0	  After stopping by the movie store to find something to watch , we stumbled on this . It looked appealing from the summary , at least , so we gave it a try . And here 's the kicker : the first 20 minutes are interesting ! It 's actually enjoyable ! Oh , wait , spoke too soon . Somewhere in there , the movie took a disgusting turn into fundamental , right-wing Christian brain-washing . Not entirely sure what happens , but I think the screenplay writer found God somewhere in there , finished writing this script , and had no time to edit it because he had a KK meeting to get to with his friends from the Westboro Church and his hood wasn't clean . Can they put warnings on this ? I refuse to support this religious idiocy . Much like video games have rating systems , movies need some sort of symbol : maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to take a turn for the worse . Unless you share sentiments with whatever moron came up with this story , and will have your Bible open in your lap while you watch this and plan on how you 'll convert your neighbors , don't waste your time . It 's some of the worst junk that 's come out in a very long time , and the radical religious nuts don't need anymore funding .  
1	  Branagh is one of the few who understands the difference between a film and a play . Hamlet is probably the most faithful adaptation of Shakespeare to a film and yet is a very dynamic film , almost an action thriller . The scene of Hamlet 's meeting with his father 's ghost won't leave your mind .  
1	  While being an impressionable youth when first experiencing the Gundam Wing series , upon re-watching the series , I have reconfirmed my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated , but the plot , the gundam design , character design , and character depth are masterfully executed . While at first appearing like a boy band of sorts , the stylish attractiveness of the characters can partly be credited to just great art , with individual personalities creating clear and endearing distinctions among the characters . Consequently , it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character . Personally , I liked Heero because of his stoic personality . While I may be biased with a sentimental attachment of this show to my childhood , I can objectively say that Gundam Wing addresses the deeper questions of war and life in general ( how can we obtain peace ? ) while providing action packed battles in large robot suits , which , to say the least , is excellent .  
0	  .. And I never thought a movie deserved to be awarded a 1 ! But this one is honestly the worst movie I 've ever watched . My wife picked it up because of the cast , but the storyline right since the DVD box seemed quite predictable . It is not a mystery , nor a juvenile-catching film . It does not include any sensuality , if that 's what the title could remotely have suggest any of you . This is just a total no-no . Don't waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a bunch of youngsters in a as-grown-up kind of Gothic setting , where a killer is going after them . Nothing new , nothing interesting , nothing worth watching . Max Makowski makes the worst of Nick Stahl .  
1	  I find I enjoy this show , but the format needs some work . First off , the good attributes . I like how this show will take us through the day-to-day life of an addict because the producers have a knack at getting the addict to show us how bad they 've allowed their lives to become . This is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome . Intervention doesn't candy-coat things and sometimes the outcome ( often short term due to the constraints of time between filming and airing ) is a negative outcome . This makes the positive outcomes all the better . Another thing I like about the show is the quality of the camera work . Given the reality that these cameramen have to squeeze anywhere and don't have the benefit of re shooting scenes the photography is surprisingly good and stable . It 's actually superior to scripted shows like " The Shield " where the photography is so bad it can induce nausea . Now for the bad . An episode will sometimes contain two completely different and unrelated cases that will be mixed together during the show . You 'll get caught up in the story of one addict then suddenly you 're thrown into the story of another . Get caught up in that story then suddenly you 're back to the first addict .. or are you ? By now you may have forgotten which case the individual currently on screen belong to . This constant flip-flopping between addicts really gets disruptive during the intervention scenes because the show will even mix together the two completely unrelated interventions ! I once heard the marketing B.S. reason for this poor design : " The show can get so intense that switching to another addict allows the viewer time to absorb what they 're watching . " Oh please . Clearly the reason this is done is because they have two cases that aren't big enough for an hour show so they mix two together . By mixing them instead of giving each a half hour block , like they should , it forces the viewer to watch the entire thing ( and the commercials ) if they are interested in one case but not the other . I used to find these " blender " episodes so annoying that I 'd only tell my TiVo to record episodes containing one addict , but then it became easier just to record all of them .  
0	  Ariauna Albright is a really good actress but why she participated in this lame written travesty is a mystery . What could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom . The unique thing about Ariauna is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner Lilith Stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the spa or beautician . This was a production that cried out for some T & A & with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things . However Ariauna does what she can under the circumstances & to a extent salvages her reputation . The Tempe company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play & T & A. Nough said .  
0	  First of all , I firmly believe that Norwegian movies are continually getting better . From the tedious emotional films of the 70 's and 80 's , movies from this place actually started to contain a bit of humour . Imagine .. Actual comedies were made ! Movies were actually starting to get entertaining and funny , as opposed to long , dark , depressing and boring . During the 90 's and 00 's several really great movies were made by a ' new generation ' of filmmakers . Movie after movie were praised by critics and played loads of money . It became the norm ! Then came United .. * MINOR SPOILERS * It 's just simply not funny . Not once . Not ever . But the thing is .. We THINK its funny . Because we 're used to norwegian movies to be funny . Especially with a cast like this with a few really funny comedians . But .. They neither say nor do anything funny ! Where 's the humor ? Show me the humor ! Is it the awkward clerk played by Harald Eia ? Is it the overacting totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach ? Is it the commentaries by Arne Scheie ? The movie is just not funny ! But thats not my main rant about United . That namely is the predictability . ( And it is here I fear that norwegian comedies have come to a standstill since I have seen this in many other movies as well . ) All the time you just know its going to end well . All characters are exactly as they are presented in the start of the movie , and everybody gets exactly what they deserve in the end . There 's absolutely no room for surprises at all ! All in all I can say that I sat with a bad feeling after seeing this movie . It was the one movie that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in norwegian movie making .. again ! Rating : 1/6  
1	  When I saw that this film was only 80 minutes long , I thought we were in trouble . Condensing the gigantic W. Somerset Maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen . But you know , the movie 's not half bad , and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers . I 've heard many film buffs complain that Leslie Howard was a wet noodle of an actor , and he was , but I can't think of anyone more suited to play the role of Philip Carey than a wet noodle , for that 's certainly what Carey is . Howard plays him well , which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly , then finally take him out and buy him a spine . Ah , and then there 's Bette , as the girl with whom Carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him . I didn't know what on earth the appeal of Mildred was in the book , and the movie stays true to that detail . But as played by Davis , she does become the most fascinating character in the story , and if she 's nasty and unlikable , she 's at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time . Davis 's performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting , much as Brando 's would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out " Stella ! " in that little-known Tennesee Williams play , and it 's not hard to see why . Davis is intense to the point of scary . She makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience , and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous . Her appearance when Carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease ( though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it 's an STD ) is shocking . Of course , it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the Production Code went into effect ; if it had been made a year later , you can bet things would have been a bit different . Yes , much of the novel , and many of its most interesting parts , are left on the cutting room floor , and the story really does become about Carey and Mildred and not much else . I found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of Maugham 's novel , but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now , so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did . Grade : B +  
1	  If you like Sci-Fi , Monsters , and Ancient Legends , then you will love this movie ! The Special Effects are by far the best I have seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago . While the acting may have been a little less than desirable , the story line and effects adequately compensated for it . I wish now I had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our 42 inch big screen TV . If you like non-stop action , awesome visuals , and taste for myth and lore .. you have to see this movie !  
0	  I don't understand how " 2 of us " receive such a high rating .. I thought that the first half dragged on and the second half didnt make sense , followed by an unresolved climax which was not worth the trouble . However , I did like Jared Harris ' performance of John Lennon which was worth the wasted 2 hours .  
0	  A student filmmaker enlists a B-grade actress ( a delectably diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD ! ) to complete the horror film that her mother ( a dreadfully dull Kylie Minogue ! ) tried to make 12 years ago . It 's a curious plot choice to say the least , as any Aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors . The film has a curse on it , because Molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set . But she 's back , because she needs the exposure . Unfortunately , the curse is still there and people start dying on the " set . " Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern " slasher , " but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table . In fact , it rips half of Wes Craven 's 90s filmography . Lots of film-world name-dropping a la " Scream " ( except it 's Aussie name-dropping-Jane Campion .. see how this isn't as funny ) and lots of " is this real or is this a movie " a la " New Nightmare . " The editing is bad , the music is annoying , the effects are laughable , almost everything is bad about this . Fortunately , the film can have a sense of humor : at one point , a well-dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at : " Don't worry , we 'll treat your house as if it were our own , " to which he responds , " that doesn't mean anything to me , you look like you live in a dump ! " Ha ! And Molly 's ridiculous one-liners were enough to not regret renting this one . " You got any diet coke in here ? " ( as she rides in the film professor 's car ) and " Does anyone know where I can buy any tofu ? " ( the first thing she mutters on the set ) and " Where the hell is my agent ? " ( oh wait , that 's what I was thinking for her . )  
1	  It is very rare for a film to appeal to viewers of all ages-to children for a fine narrative and a wonderful , colorful production , and , to adults , for a literate script , fine production values , good casting / acting , all bound together with a fine Rozsa score . Two roughly contemporary films accomplish this - " Thief of Baghdad " ( 1940 ) and " The Adventures of Robin Hood " ( 1938 ) . Some of the back story on this production is fascinating . This production , commenced in England in the summer of 1939 , moved to Hollywood , and proved a cover for British intelligence efforts ! The producer , Alexander Korda , was subsequently knighted in 1942 . Here is a unique case of the intersection of art , commerce , and politics ! By all means , secure a good CD of this film for your library !  
0	  ' Chances Are ' a big mistake to see . You could know director Emile Ardolino from ' Dirty Dancing ' and ' Sister Act ' and should expect something amusing from him . But I guess I have to disillusion you . He made a really , really bad movie . According to the story Christopher McDonald dies to reburn as a baby . The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr , and Jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter , Mary Stuart Masterson ( complicated , huh ? ) . They fall in love with each other . Then appears Jr former wife , Cybill Shepherd , and Jr falls in love with her too . I guess I don't even have to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil . In one of his first roles Robert Downey Jr 's on his worst . He copies Michael J Fox . After the ' Moonlighting ' Shepherd proves that she 's not suitable for acting in movies . Anyway , there 's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used : as antidote to insomnia .  
0	  Wow , after trashing the disk of Timo Roses " Rout City " after about 15 Minutes ( South Park is about more than meaningless cursing .. I guess some people just don't get it ) I was interested in this movie . I read quite some positive stuff and the packaging and look of the movie seemed far from the total trash I expected after " Rout city " . Surprise : The movie isn't total trash but the problem seems to be exactly that . Timo Rose tries to walk in the footsteps of German Horror / Splatter Cinema like Olaf Ittenbach and the likes . That means " Barricade " is in parts extremely gory and detailed . The gore FX are not really believable but OK , the acting is OK but in some cases plain sucks . The hillbilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and doesn't get better till she 's shot . So what is the problem .. the movie is gory , has a typical German underground vibe ( including the classic booby shots in blood ) , OK FX and a modern feel to it like the packaging already promised ? ! 1 . The script is total BS . You get a typical hillbilly / lost in the woods story with some guys + gal camping out and meeting a degenerated hillbilly family . Everything is just leading towards the torture / mutilation scenes and seems unbelievably random and pointless . This is the first thing that makes " Barricade " half-hearted . 2 . Random is also the perfect description for a lot of the camera work ( I liked the repetitive cut to the tweezers in the extended booby torture scene .. either they had no material or the editor works in a hardware store ) . Even worse the editing .. sure , its modern and far better than a lot of other movies in the genre but its RANDOM . You got an overuse of that typical exposure effect everywhere and with no meaning .. its just there .. all the time . Then there 's some grainy / noisy film look which also is just thrown in here and there for the sake of it , I don't get the meaning . 3 . Like the fore-mentioned effects there is a lot of repetitive stuff in here . For example most of the kills are edited with multiple repetitions of stabbing and punching . Its OK once but here its annoying and fake , especially towards the end . Annoying also attributes the " music " which is permanently used without any change in the background . It doesn't take long until it makes the movie hardly bearable . 4 . From all this comes the biggest problem of this movie ( and many others in my opinion ) . If you make a splatter movie with trashy feel its pretty idiotic to polish it with special FX and new school editing . It looks like they take it way too serious . Its no fun because the decent gore FX are plain wasted in this context . And where the classic gore FX are OK the computer FX in scenes like the stabbing in the mouth or the gunshots in the ending look rather silly ( and 3D splatter mostly sucks to me even in movies with a budget and decent 3D artists ) . I often wondered if the time of serious splatter movies is over and " Barricade " is just another example it might be time to put it in the tomb . Its no fun , has no character and is too trashy for its look . The script is a cheap try on " Wrong Turn " and " TCM " leading absolutely nowhere . You can take that literally .. the ending is just there and as random as many other things here ( " I love you " in a splatter flick .. come on ! ) . " Barricade " tries to incorporate a lot and fails .. you can sure fast-forward through this movie for some extensive disembowelment , acid face melting , nipple pinching and classic Friday the 13th style stabbing of a couple while fingering in a tent ( bloody boobies hooray ! ) . But its really hard to get through this . Total failure especially because you can see it could have been something .  
1	  This is a better adaptation of the book than the one with Paltrow ( although I liked that one , too ) . It isn't so much that Beckinsale is better - they are both very good - but that the screenplay is better . Davies is a master at adapting Austen for filming , and the production values here are very good . It 's not quite as glossy as the Hollywood treatment , but it 's close , and I thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better .  
0	  Where to begin ? How about with the erroneous synopsis : " X-Men Origins : Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine 's epically violent and romantic past , his complex relationship with Victor Creed , and the ominous Weapon X program . " His epically violent past turns out to exceptionally non-violent . His relationship with Creed is so glossed over it 's difficult to understand how they have any connection at all . We are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run , to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan , and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassins . There is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all . Nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving . The romantic element of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt . We are thrown into a romance so fast that it 's over before you can blink an eye . Having just introduced the character , Silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later . We are left wondering why we should care about this . Who was she anyway ? For a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story , the romance is surprisingly unexplored . It was rushed in simply because it was required . Oddly enough , when Wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find Sabertooth . Being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise . As for the weapon X program , lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure Wolverine is up and running . Eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple . Surprisingly Ma and Pa Kent aren't alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn . Is it any wonder what fate awaits them ? In the previous films and the comic books , the main reason that Wolverines ' amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded . Knowing this was the case .. did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates ? As hinted to in X2 : X-men United when Stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together . This film sets up the team fairly well only they don't really do much of anything . No disturbing violence , no ruthless actions , they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen . It seems that Wolverine wasn't an evil man under Stryker at all . Instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother Sabertooth which consequently WAS the violent agent we all thought Wolverine was . Eventually he just leaves all together . No conflict of duality here at all . Idiotically REMOVING that character conflict of good and evil DULLED the story immensely . They may as well have given him rubber claws . There were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the X-Men trilogy , including the introduction of one of the lamest Deus Ex Machinas to ever hit a script . Magic memory-erasing bullets . Really ? Apparently they are the only thing to bring down Wolverine . Yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all . Another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all . Interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story . Most were in the film for 5-10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of Wolverine . Fred Dukes ( the Blob but not the comic version ) can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all , but a simple headbutt from Wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him ? Cyclops optic beams ( which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers ) can burn through buildings but when fired at Sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes . Adamantium trench coats anyone ? The ( gravity defying ) mutant Gambit , instead of utilizing his signature cards , is made into some sort of crazy acrobat . In one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by Wolverine .. then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running TOWARDS Wolverine . How he regained consciousness , ran away a few blocks , climbed up a building , then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained . Some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash . The idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect . The comic book source material , the REAL origin of Wolverine .. is a story worth bringing to the screen . It doesn't sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless CGI junkies . It is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time , began with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith . A much more intense and exciting story . This FOX film should seriously be forgotten . Anyone have that magic gun ? 4/10  
0	  Yes , The Southern Star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set crooner Matt Monro . It pretty much establishes the tone for this bloated and rather dull feature , stunningly miscast with George Segal and Ursula Andress as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond . Add in Harry Andrews ( with a strange accent , no less ) chasing an ostrich , tons of stock footage of wildlife , and poorly composed and dull photography by Raoul Coutard , and you end up with a thoroughly unexciting romp through the jungles of Senegal .  
0	  What an appalling film . Don't get me wrong , Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors , but aside from a few interesting set pieces , the film is mostly taken up with hysterical submariners shouting , crying , sweating and generally freaking out when anything goes wrong . Take that with simplistic asides to make sure the audience still understand what 's going on ( the scene where Denzel Washington explains to a radio repairman how he must be like Scotty in Star Trek is nothing more than a joke ) and you have a dumbed down thriller not worthy of the acting . Let us just hope that the real nuclear US Navy is not in the hands of such a script !  
1	  I love this movie . It is great film that combines English and Indian cultures with feminist-type issues , such as girls wanting to play sports that were previously reserved for men . It shows the struggles of both an Indian person wanting to break outside her cultural barriers and women wanting to break outside the gender restrictions found in sports , especially in England at the time . I feel that the cultural struggles are more emphasized than the other issues . In contrast to the other comment , I do not think this movie is anything like Dirty Dancing or any other such chick flick . This move is loved by many types of people , men and women , young and old alike .  
0	  I watched Grendel the other night and am compelled to put together a Public Service Announcement . Grendel is another version of Beowulf , the thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic poem . The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of inoffensive and uninteresting movies , and the previews promised an inauthentic low-budget mini-epic , but this one refused to let me switch channels . It was staggeringly , overwhelmingly , bad . I watched in fascination and horror at the train wreck you couldn't tear your eyes away from . I reached for a notepad and managed to capture part of what I was seeing . The following may contain spoilers or might just save your sanity . You 've been warned . - Just to get it over with , Beowulf 's warriors wore horned helmets . Trivial issue compared to what came after . It also appears that the helmets were in a bin and handed to whichever actor wandered by next . Fit , appearance and function were apparently irrelevant . - Marina Sirtis had obviously been blackmailed into doing the movie by the Ringling Brothers , Barnum and Bailey circus . She managed to avoid a red rubber nose , but the clowns had already done the rest of her makeup . - Ben Cross pretended not to be embarrassed as the king . His character , Hrothgar , must have become king of the Danes only minutes before the film opened and hadn't had a chance to get the crown resized to fit him yet . - To facilitate the actors ' return to their day jobs waiting tables , none were required to change their hairstyles at all . The variety of hair included cornrows , sideburns , buzz cuts and a mullet and at least served to distract from the dialog . To prove it was a multi-national cast , all were encouraged to retain whatever accent they chose . - As is typical with this type of movie ( at least since Mad Max ) , leather armor was a requirement . In this case it was odd-shaped , ill-fitting and brand-new . - The female love interest , Ingrid , played by Alexis Peters , followed a long-standing tradition of hotties who should be watched with the volume turned completely down . - The unintended focus of the movie was a repeating , compound crossbow with exploding bolts . It never needed to be loaded and even had a recoil when fired . It managed to shred the laws of physics , the integrity of the original legend , historical fact and plot suspense all by itself . - Hrothgar 's palace , Heorot , rather than being a Norse long hall , apparently was designed and constructed by artisans who sank with Atlantis . - Beowulf arrived at the Danes ' homeland in a two-masted stern-castled ship that originally was part of a set , the other two being the Santa Maria and the Pinta . - Prince Unferth observed Beowulf 's ship 's approach using a telescope . Before you could recover from that astounding innovation , you got to see the ship from his point of view . Judging from the angle , the prince was in an aircraft of some sort . - Fun fact 1 : In Bulgaria , fire ( as from a fireplace ) creates light without heat . This explains why you could see the actors ' breath whether indoors or out . - Fun fact 2 : Dark Age dancing in Denmark looks like slow dances I went to in the 8th grade . - Fun fact 3 : You , too , can make a catapult with a timed-release air-burst explosive . But , don't expect it to actually harm anything . Incidentally , Beowulf was apparently a veteran of World War II , yelling " Incoming ! " to shred any remaining suspension of disbelief . - Grendel was so upset and always in a snit because as a completely CGI creation he couldn't leave footprints . Even in snow . - Grendel 's mom ( " Hag " ) was in a foul mood because she was a single mother and junior hadn't inherited her wings . Recessive gene , I suppose . By the way , we can now make an educated guess that Grendel 's pop was probably Swamp Thing . - Grendel and mom chose to randomly kill , fly away with or drag away their prey based only on a close reading of the next few pages of the script . - Fun medical fact : Being slammed by a mythical beast hard enough to be thrown fifty feet against stone causes slight facial scratches that don't bleed much . - The sword of legend Beowulf used to dispatch the Hag was as long as he was tall and would have contained enough steel to put a second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge . Luckily the wobbling dispelled any concerns over its weight . - Best line of the movie : Prince Unferth had just been impaled by Hag and spit a quart of blood roughly six feet . Princess Ingrid cradled him gently and said , " You 're going to be okay , my prince . " So much for that job at the triage clinic . I feel better now .  
1	  Just caught it at the Toronto International Film Festival . This is a good story , told in a compelling way . The handheld camera approach to action scenes added to the intensity of those scenes ( in a documentary style , not a Blair Witch style ) . Joel Schumacher shows he doesn't need a big budget to produce a gripping film . The actors were strong , particularly the actor playing the focus of the events in the film , Boz .  
0	  Sadly , more downs than ups . The plot was pretty decent . I mean , nothing out of the ordinary , but it had a story , unlike the other modern horror flicks . The other good thing was the cast . I 'm not saying that the acting was good , because it wasn't , but every actor / actress was hot and attractive . One of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so . The rest was quite boring . Another down ( or you could consider it an up if you want ) is the excessive nudity . All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes , and all the guys showed their butts for a long time . It 's not that I 'm against nudity , but this was a horror movie , not ' The Dreamers ' . Unless you 're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes , or watch a girl get naked for no reason , or you 're a die-hard fan of Debbie Rochon , than this is the movie for you . But if you 're looking for a good horror movie , stay away .  
1	  This film provides the saga of a legendary Wild Bill Hickock . He , Buffalo Bill Cody , and Calamity Jane , are the central characters . As the Civil War closes , Lincoln mentions his concern that the country 's dynamism would be enhanced if people would follow the advice , " Go West , young man , " which , mercifully , the film didn't erroneously attribute to Horace Greeley , as a number of others did . But then , he gets assassinated , and some financiers speculate that they can get rich selling weapons to the American Indians . In the meantime , we see Wild Bill Hickock , who interacts with a small boy , while a steamboat is loading at a dock along the Mississippi . Wild Bill uses a Bowie knife , which he eventually gives to the boy , calling it an " Arkansas Toothpick , " which in reality was a different type of knife , though both were used throughout the frontier . Hickock eventually meets Buffalo Bill Cody , who looks close to the photographs and paintings of the actual man . Cody has just gotten married , and is bringing his bride to the Old West to settle down . When they arrive at their destination , they run into Calamity Jane , who has a crush on Hickock . She looks at Cody 's wife , and asks Buffalo Bill , " Is this your mopsy ? " The line was one that caused the Hayes Board some problem , since one definition of " mopsy " was prostitute . Demille wanted the line in , and one of his aides pointed out that in Beatrix Potter 's books about Peter Rabbit , three of the rabbits were Flopsy , Mopsy , and Cottontail . He pointed this out and asked the censors to identify " the rabbit of ill virtue . " It worked ; the line stayed in . The Indians were getting restless , in part because of the superior weaponry they got from the agent of the Eastern financiers . Cody and Hickock were asked to help scout the area , so that troops could get safely through to a beleaguered area . Cody led the troops ; Hickock went to check out the activities of an Indian chief , who was an old acquaintance , and who was leading some of the hostile Indians . Calamity Jane gets captured , and Hickock gets captured trying to save her . They are brought to the chief , and although neither would talk , torture applied to Hickock breaks Calamity Jane 's willpower , and she tells the route Cody is using . The two are released , and Hickock joins up with Cody and his forces , in part to alert them they 're walking into a trap . With Hickok 's help , they hold off the Indian attack . Hickock decides to go after the gun runners , and finally takes them prisoner . As they 're waiting for authorities , Hickock is gunned down by being shot in the back while playing cards . There are numerous historic anomalies in the film , but it retains the flavor of legend . Pretty good for the 1930s .  
1	  For real film people , this film is a must , since it works as a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves . Janos Rukh / Boris Karloff 's science has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena . This light can do harm , or it can be harnessed to do good . On the one hand it blinds his mother , on the other it is used to cure blindness ( " I can see ! " shouts a young girl on whose eyes this light is projected ) . When Rukh / Karloff is himself poisoned by the uncanny power of this light , we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative , drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection , an entity viewed on film ( only visible , as in a movie theater , when the lights are out ) . There is a wonderful passage near the beginning where Karloff / Rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured in light which rolls through space for millions of years , as the light from Andromeda was emitted from that Galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock . There are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed to older cultural vehicles : that of the writer , in the persona of Beulah Bondi / Arabella Stevens ; and religion , emblemized in the sculptural figures on the local cathedral Karloff blasts with his projector / ray gun . One has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in Germany at the time , and particularly at Riefenstall 's use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm : Triumph of the Will . Happily in the end , Mother ( Violet Kemble Cooper ) intervenes , reminding Janos Rukh of the first rule of science . If only more movies made you want to stand up in the theater and shout : " I can see ! "  
1	  " Fanfan la tulipe " is still Gerard Philippe 's most popular part and it began the swashbuckler craze which throve in the French cinema in the 1955-1965 years . It made Gina Lollobrigida a star ( Lollobrigida and Philippe would team up again in René Clair " s " Belles de nuit " the same year . " Fanfan la tulipe " is completely mad , sometimes verging on absurd . Henri Jeanson 's witty lines - full of dark irony - were probably influenced by Voltaire and " Candide " . Antimilitarism often comes to the fore : " these draftees radiate joie de vivre - and joie de mourir when necessary ( joy of life and joy of death ) " It becomes necessary to recruit men when the casualties outnumber the survivors " " You won the battle without the thousands of deaths you had promised me , king Louis XV complains , but no matter , let 's wait for the next time . " A voice over comments the story at the beginning and at the end and history is given a rough ride : height of irony , it 's a genuine historian who speaks ! Christian-Jaque directs the movie with gusto and he knows only one tempo : accelerated . Remake in 2003 with Vincent Perez and Penelope Cruz . I have not seen it but I do not think it had to be made in the first place .  
0	  I am a Catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns , taught by Jesuit priests in high school & college . I am still a practicing Catholic but would not be considered a " good Catholic " in the church 's eyes because I don't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to . So back to the movie .. its bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead . There is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of Diane Keaton . I never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good . At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary 's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith . But it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy .. the tragedy of loss of life ( besides the two former students .. the lives of the aborted babies , the life of the student 's mom ) , the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people , the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God . This is what is wrong with today 's Islam , and yesterday 's Judaism and Christianity .  
1	  My mother and I were on our way home from a trip up to the North East ( mainly Massachusetts ) when we decided to take a little detour a attend a film festival in Boston . Now , I don't know much about film so I thought this might be a bit educational . The first movie we saw was this one , THE ROMEO DIVISION . Now , I don't know about you but I thought this was great ! I 'm from Texas and where I come from we don't see too many motion pictures so this was a pleasant surprise . My mother insisted that it was too violent , but said that I didn't know much about what she was saying but this was a great picture . I was shocked by the fight sequences they were great . Also , I am a big fan when the good guys win so I was thrilled when Romeo ladies killed all of the bad guys . This was true brilliance . I 'm not sure when it 's getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out . I think you 'll be pleasantly surprised . A word to the wise though , it is rather violent and there many cuss words so you may not want to let your children watch . It 's more for adults .  
1	  When I was 17 my high school staged Bye Bye Birdie - which is no great surprise , since it is perfect high school material and reputed to be the most-staged musical in the world . I was a music student and retained strong memories of the production and its songs , as well as a lingering disregard for the Dick Van Dyke movie version which had ( deliberately ) obscured the Elvis references and camped it up for a swinging 60s audience . So , when the 1995 version starring Jason Alexander hit my cable TV screen , I was delighted with what I saw . Alexander turns in an exceptional performance as Albert , a performance in strong contrast to his better-known persona from a certain TV series . The remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles ( Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part , supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirl ) . But best of all , the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be ( allowing for the absence of a stage ) . So , if you know the musical ( and few do not ) , then check out this telemovie . It does the stage show justice in a way which can probably not be bettered , which is good enough for me . What is better than rendering a writer 's work faithfully and with colour and style ?  
0	  About the worst movie in distribution right now ! I love zombie movies and saw this in the used rack so I thought why not ? Oh my god a shame to zombie movies and fans to the genre ! Whoever made this movie needs to put away your camcorder and go to film school ! There are so many gore hounds out there who have put time and effort into their films and they have something that this film doesn't dignity . I know it what it takes to make films and I 'm sure there was a lot of money and time spent in making Meat Market but none of that money and time went in to making it good . You need actors , a script , a real camera , invest in some books on how to make independent films . I don't know how you got a DVD release but whoever did that is either a really good friend or banging their head on the wall . In gore films it is quality not quantity , the effects are weak ! I was so angry that this is actually in stores and that I couldn't get my money back . Please if you have seen this film write here and put an end to shlock . I know I 'm being very harsh , I only had 10 lines so I 'm trying to get to the point .  
0	  " This might mean the end of the white race ! " gasps a general as a dozen Native Zombies wander around the battlefields of Europe during the " Great War " . An expedition sets out tor the long-lost , back-projected city of Kennif-Angor to stop this sort of thing and keep the battlefields clear for decent honest white people to slaughter each other by the tens of thousands . It is a bit hard to tell when people are zombies or not in this film as the acting is so wooden . Even by 1936 standards the acting in this film is bad . From a previous decade . It looks like it came out of a correspondence school text book on ' How to Act ' - Chapter Three : Emotions - " How to express fear and loathing ( Female ) Clench both fists . Place fist of one hand on heart . Open mouth as it to scream . Place other fist , palm out , against mouth . Hold pose for 10 seconds longer than is comfortable then quickly turn head 90 degrees away from direction of loathed object and sob " . " How to have difficult , heavily emotionally charged scene with ex-fiancé explaining your love for someone else . Do NOT make eye contact . Do not move . Do not show any emotion . Do not move your eyes too much as you read your lines off the studio wall . " To give us a respite from the leaden acting the director cunningly cuts in long pauses where nothing much happens except that film keeps running through the projectors . Thus 35 minute 's worth of story is padded out to 60ish minutes . The revolt of the zombies when it comes is so slow ! Released from mental bondage the armies of ex-zombiefied minions turn on their former master by ambling slowly up hill and then sort of stabbing a door a bit and smashing a window . " Yea .. let 's .. oh , I dunno yeah . Let 's get him grr . Frankenstein must be destroyed - manana . " ( though I have just found a bit of hidden symbolism . Jagger is shot by a Native as some sort of ironic counterpoint to all the Natives being shot by the Germans at the start of the flick . see , even downtrodden Natives don't want the end of the White Race ! ) The chase ( it you can call it that ) through the back-projected swamp is hilarious and worth the admission price alone . Roy D'Arcy has a hell of a time camping it up , but is totally wasted , as Col . Mazovia . There is one interesting moment in this film . A nice little montage of the zombied natives and white cast members falling under the evil eyes spell . face after face , cross-fade into one another . It works , though there is a strange little blip in the middle of each close up like a frame has been cut . I guess these must be Neg Cutters ' frames between the fades . Best watched with friends and in a silly mood .  
1	  First off , if you 're planning on watching this , make sure to watch the UNCUT version ( although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that were tampered with due to censorship ) , it makes a HUGE difference . This film is about a young woman , played by Barbara Stanwyck , who since the age of 14 has been forced into prostitution by her own father . When her father suddenly passes away , she is able to go out into the world on her own . After reading about Nietzsche 's philosophies on life , she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love . Throughout the movie she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder is she has any sense of morality left at all . Overall , Baby Face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film . While no sexual acts are explicitly shown on screen , it is very obvious what is happening off camera . I enjoyed watching this film very much and I believe most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out if it , especially with the films shock value . I did think while watching it that the pacing seemed a bit slow at parts , but I think that about most movies the first time is see them . Actually , I think that almost all movies I 've seen made from the early 30 's had some minor pacing problems or certain parts just didn't quite " flow " right . This was probably just the craft of film-making wasn't quite perfected yet  it would take just a few more years . Compare a film from 1939 and compare it with an early 30 's film and I think you 'll see what I mean . Once again , I 'm very glad I was able to watch the original cut ; it really does make a big difference . Also any John Wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role .  
0	  Poor Tobe Hopper . He directed an all time horror classic " Texas Chaimsaw Massacre " . Since then everything he 's done has been horrible . This is probably the worst .. and that 's saying a lot . It 's about a man ( Brad Dourif ) who has the ability to make things ( and people ) catch fire .. or something like that . Hardly an original idea ( anyone remember " Firestarter " ? ) It 's a real mess .. literally EVERYTHING is done wrong ! Pathetic acting ( even Dourif ! ) , asinine script , loust production values , crappy special effects .. everything is BAD ! A must miss .. not even good for laughs .  
1	  Somerset Maugham 's characters are brought to life in RKO 's " Of Human Bondage " ; but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel , with Bette Davis ' star-making performance sucking up all of the energy . Otherwise , it 's the story of Leslie Howard ( as Philip Carey ) ; he dreams of becoming a painter , but is told he has no talent for the arts . As the film progresses , Mr. Howard 's struggles , instead , to become a doctor . His efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts ; though successful in medicine , his painting seemed easier - also , note the symbolism of his disability , a " club foot " ( explained in the film ) . Along the way ( right away , in this version ) , Howard becomes infatuated with waitress Davis ( as Mildred Rogers ) . Davis ' characterization of " Mildred " is extraordinary , culminating in a spectacular speech , when she tells Howard , among other things , that she had to " WIPE MY MOUTH ! " after kissing him . Howard also performs well , but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for Davis ; so , their performances are wasted . Still , a film to watch for the acting , including some good supporting players . Bette Davis ' characterization was famous for inspiring a " write-in " campaign for the 1934 " Best Actress " Academy Award . For the record , she placed third . The results were : 1 . Claudette Colbert - " It Happened One Night " 2 . Norma Shearer - " The Barretts of Wimpole Street " 3 . Bette Davis - " Of Human Bondage " 4 . Grace Moore - " One Night of Love " * Of Human Bondage ( 6/28/34 ) John Cromwell ~ Leslie Howard , Bette Davis , Reginald Denny  
1	  I went into Deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller ; and while that 's something like what this film is ; I also can't help but think that it 's just a poor man 's Sleuth . The classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film ; not particularly in terms of the plot , but certainly it 's the case with the execution . The casting of Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it . The film is based on a play by Ira Levin ( who previously wrote Rosemary 's Baby and The Stepford Wives ) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl ; a playwright whose best days are behind him . After his latest play bombs , Sidney finds himself at a low ; and this is not helped when a play named Deathtrap ; written by an amateur he taught , arrives on his doorstep . Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success , and Sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own ; which involves inviting round the amateur scribe , killing him , and then passing Deathtrap off as his own work . Despite all of its clever twists and turns ; Deathtrap falls down on one primary element , and that 's the characters . The film fails to provide a single likable character , and it 's very hard to care about the story when you 're not rooting for any of the players . This is not helped by the acting . Michael Caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect , but nobody else does themselves proud . Christopher Reeve is awkward in his role , while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance . It 's lucky then that the story is good ; and it is just about good enough to save the film . The plot features plenty of twists and turns ; some work better than others , but there 's always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting . Director Sidney Lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus . The central location is interesting in its own right , and the cinematography fits the film well . Overall , I have to admit that I did enjoy this film ; but it could have been much , much better .  
1	  From the writer of " What Ever Happened to Baby Jane ? " and " Hush .. Hush , Sweet Charlotte , " this tail-end of the sixties horror cycle has some eerie and campy fun . Micheál Macliammóir does a Victor Buono-type bit , but too often the movie totters dangerously close to a bad musical .. there 's a particularly awful children 's recital about halfway through . Debbie taps , tangos and tricks up a lá Harlow , while Winters ' religious fanatic has a lesbian edge to her . Agnes Moorehead checks in as an evangelist . Weaver has nothing to do - and even has to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie .  
1	  In this sequel to the 1989 action-comedy classic K-9 , detective Dooley [ James Belushi ] and his dog Jerry Lee return to fight crime , but this time they are teamed up with another detective [ Christine Tucci ] and her partner , a mean Doberman named Zues who does not get along with Jerry Lee very well . Dooley does not get along with his new partner much either . That all changes as the movie goes along . The movie is intense as their is a guy that really wants to kill Dooley for the way he treated him in the past . There is some dramatic scenes dealing with the death of Dooley 's wife that don't really seem to be with the tone of the movie because the rest of the movie is action sequences , dog poop jokes , fart jokes , and jokes about dogs biting bad guys in a certain area . I know that that seems like very low humor , but some of it is actually very funny . I didn't see this movie for the jokes , I saw it for two reasons . The first reason is because I am a big James Belushi fan and the second is for the action sequences . James Belushi is funnier than he was in K-9 and the action sequences at are better too . It would have been nice to see more characters from K-9 to return , but it 's still a fun movie . If you are a James Belushi fan , you 'll love this movie .  
1	  I have always been a huge James Bond fanatic ! I have seen almost all of the films except for Die Another Day , and The World Is Not Enough . The graphic 's for Everything Or Nothing are breathtaking ! The voice talents .. WOW ! I LOVE PIERCE BROSNAN ! He is finally Bond in a video game ! HE IS BOND ! I enjoyed the past Bond games : Goldeneye , The World Is Not Enough , Agent Under Fire , and Nightfire . This one is definitely the best ! Finally , Mr. Brosnan , ( may I call him Mr. Brosnan as a sign of respect ? Yes I can ! ) He was phenomenally exciting to hear in a video game .. AT LONG LAST ! DUH ! I 've seen him perform with Robin Williams , and let me tell you , they make a great team . Pierce Brosnan is funny , wickedly handsome ( I mean to say wickedly in a good way , ) and just one of those actor 's who you would want to walk up to and wrap your arms around and hug , saying : " Pierce Brosnan , thank you for being James Bond , " " If it wasn't for you , I wouldn't know who James Bond is . " He 's a great actor ! I am a huge fan of Willem Dafoe even though I 've seen him in a couple of movies . His role as Nikolai Diavalo was brilliant . ( Did I spell the character 's name right ? ) LOL ! He does a great job with an accent . Sometimes I can't even hear an accent . I have seen Willem , I mean Mr. Dafoe , perform in two movies : Finding Nemo , and Spider-Man with my favorite actress : KIRSTEN DUNST ! SHE ROCKS ! Anyway , He never ceases to amaze . And Richard Kiel , wow , he 's definitely got the part of Jaw 's nailed . I 've seen him in the movie 's and he 's awesome ! As a matter of fact , my Grandparent 's have met Mr. Kiel , and I was jealous when they told me . But , Kirsten Dunst is at the top of my list of Celebritie 's that I want to meet . John Cleese was breathtaking . I have never seen a better person play as the wisecracking , and gadget creating Q ! Mr. Cleese was hilarious ! I 've seen him work with Pierce Brosnan in Goldeneye and Tommorow Never Dies . He 's awesome ! John Cleese 's most recent project is Shrek 2 starring Mike Myer 's , Cameron Diaz , Julie Andrew 's and Eddie Murphy . ( Shrek 2 is now in theatre 's ! ) GOOD LUCK 007 ! Oh , yeah , and as Q alway 's says : " Grow up 007 ! "  
1	  Right at this moment I am watching this movie for the second time ( on television ) and for the second time I fell into it when it was running for an hour already ( I think I saw 2 minutes more this time ) This movie is really impressing , the way Goldsworthy looks at nature , changes nature in a way that you yourself would never think of , really is amazing . This whole movie gives you a warm feeling , seeing him play with the world around him with such love . Or only seeing his hands , covered in dirt and with broken fingernails , it just touches you .  
1	  WRITTEN ON THE WIND , directed by Douglas Sirk and released in 1956 , is like all of Sirk 's mid 50 's films - pure melodrama . Yet it is engrossing , richly developed melodrama , and Sirk 's trademark lurid colour expressionism , throbbing , barely repressed emotions , symbolism and juxtaposition of the classes make this a film to crave . The film opens brilliantly , with the four central characters and the plot being introduced as the credits are still rolling . Sirk uses a clever flashback structure to take us into his world .. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are magnificent as the two Hadley " kids " , Kyle and Marylee . He drinks and sleeps around with women . She drinks and sleeps around with men . They both are worth millions , thanks to the Hadley oil business . Hunky , yet poor , Mitch Wayne ( Rock Hudson ) is Kyle 's lifelong friend , and Marylee 's dream lover . Enter into this sordid mess Lucy Moore ( Lauren Bacall ) , a slim , attractive young woman who falls under Kyle 's charms after he picks up a phone and flies her across the countryside one evening . Mitch loves her too , but Kyle wins her . They quickly marry , and Kyle stops drinking . But fate seems to be written on the wind , and it is not long before a conniving Marylee ( who will " have Mitch " , marriage or no marriage ) , a secretly smitten Mitch , the confused Lucy and the sad drunk Kyle come to blows .. Malone is just wonderful as Marylee Hadley , thoroughly deserving her Best Supporting Actress Oscar . She steals every scene she is in . Stack is almost just as good , amping up the melodrama , while still maintaining subtly and quiet desperation . Hudson and Bacall are a lot more restrained than those two , yet it is in keeping with the characters they play . So , what 's all this melodrama really about it ? Well , a lot of things . Stack 's powerful portrait of male inadequacy and fear , for one thing . Sirk surrounds Stack with phallic symbols throughout the film - note his tiny little gun , the oil derricks and the ultimate phallic symbol , Kyle 's seeming inability to conceive children . Stack seems to be suffering from a massive male superiority complex , made worse by his father 's preference for Hudson , his sister 's desire for Hudson , and his suspicion that his wife is carrying on with Hudson . With all this wealth Kyle Hadley still ends up at the wrong end of town , buying cheap corn liquor like a " bum " . It 's about impossible dreams , and having to let go of them . The river where Kyle , Marylee and Mitch used to play when they were kids is constantly referenced throughout the film , symbolising Kyle and ( especially ) Marylee 's wish for the innocence and simplicity of youth . In an excellent melodramatic scene , perfectly pulled off by Malone , Marylee 's stands by the river and imagines herself again as a child , with voice-over of Mitch telling Marylee that she will always be his girl . This is where Sirk strikes a huge emotional chord with the viewer . Who hasn't dreamed about going back to that special place in childhood ? Who hasn't , at some point , lived on a treasured memory ? Who hasn't wanted something they couldn't have ? And Hudson 's last line of the film ( yes , he gets no dialogue in the last 10 or so minutes , only close-ups ) recollects on how " far we 've come from the river , Marylee " . Amazing .  
0	  I like movies about morally corrupt characters , but this was too much . The acting wasn't great , but that wasn't the real problem . The issue was the sinking feeling I got in the pit of my stomach about 20 minutes into the film . These characters were hollow . They had almost no depth , and what little they did have was devoted to the cruelty they displayed to each other in the guise of friendship . Exploring the darker sides of a set of characters can be fascinating , but you have to give those characters actual personalities or they are just cardboard cutouts . These characters were cardboard and the picture they gave was just ugly .  
1	  If I remember , Ira Gershwin , the lyricist and brother of George , offered the Gershwin catalog for this film and it was snapped up by the producers . In many respects , it was a typical 50 's movie musical by the Freed Unit at MGM and directed by Vincente Minelli with a lot of help from Gene Kelly . The Gershwins were , of course , among the greatest of all Broadway musical teams but , in my opinion , George himself was among the greatest of all American composers , period ! Gene Kelly was , of course , one of the two greatest male dancers of the movie musical ( One guess as to the other ? ) and I don't imagine his casting was ever in doubt . But , I think the rest of the cast needs some explanation : Oscar Levant was a noted personality in his time and , as an actual friend of George Gershwin , he had to be in this film . He was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a noted neurotic and hypochondriac and here , as always , he plays himself . Leslie Caron was an unknown at this time and she was of the French " gamin " type . A talented dancer , she was never a real beauty . George Guétary who plays the part of Maurice Chavalier , oops , I mean Henri Baurel , was Greek and not French but he certainly is more than OK as a French boulevardier even if a little too young for the part . Gene 's hoofer 's voice is serviceable here but Guétary has much the better vocal equipment . Though Gene was better cast elsewhere as , obviously , in " Singin ' in the Rain " where his character is much more calculating , even here he shows himself to be something of a heel at times ( He was , not for nothing , cast as the original heel Joey in Pal Joey , the Broadway musical . ) I was not so enchanted with his " I Got Rhythm " scene with the children which does not appear as spontaneous as was intended in my opinion . I also found Nina Foch 's character Milo to be rather irritating . But the highlight of the film is obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great French Impressionist painters . I found it difficult to believe Gene and Oscar , as struggling artists , and I don't think the musical numbers are as well set up as they might be but , on balance , the Gershwin music is very well served in this film . The DVD is well-done with fine clear graphics ( when they are supposed to be ) and the mono sound is good but a trifle shallow .  
1	  This cartoon was strange , but the story actually had a little more depth and emotion to it than other cartoon movies . We have a girl at a camp with low self esteem and hardly any other friends , except a brother and sister who are just a miserable as she is . She reaches the ultimate low point and when the opportunity arises she literally makes a pact with a devil-like demon . I found this film to be very true to life and just when things couldn't be worse , the girl sees what she 's done , she feels remorse and then changes and then she helps this dark , mystical creature learn the human quality of love . The twins improve too , by helping the little bears and then they get a sense of self worth too . A very positive message for children , though some elements of the film was strange , it was and still is a rather enjoyable film . The music from Stephen Bishop ( Tootsie songs ) made the film even better  
1	  I finally got around to seeing this after hearing great things about it . It actually exceeded my expectations . Considering the budget involved this was a surprisingly competent and well-made film . The lack of finances actually helped this film in several ways , especially given the plot . Just like The Blair Witch Project , this film was all the better for being shot on video instead of film . Another bonus : Whereas most low-budget horror films ( even the best of the best ) suffer from mediocre-to-unintentionally hysterical acting , this film actually had a talented cast ( save one or two characters ) , particularly the two leads . The only thing missing from the film was an original storyline . It borrows heavily from better-known films like " Deliverance " and " Wrong Turn " but if you 're like me , films of this nature never cease to be terrifying . Plus , the director keeps things interesting throughout . I 'd be very interested to see what the director would do with a bigger budget and I have a feeling it will only be a matter of time before we find out ..  
1	  It is projected that between 2000 and 2020 , 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS . The projected toll is greatest in sub-Saharan Africa where 55 million additional deaths can be expected . Beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about . Christophe Honoré describes one of the most moving in Close to Leo , a film produced for French television as part of a series dealing with issues facing young people . Though fictional , it deals with a situation that is unfortunately too common - the effect of a diagnosis of HIV on a loving close-knit family . When twenty one-year old Leo ( Pierre Mignard ) tells his parents and two teenage brothers , Tristan ( Rodolphe Pauley ) and Pierrot ( Jeremie Lippmann ) that he has AIDS , the family is devastated . Out of concern for his youth , they decide to withhold the information from his youngest brother , 12-year old Marcel ( Yannis Lespert ) but he overhears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically . When Leo goes to Paris for treatment , he takes Marcel with him but the young boy confronts Leo and demands to know the truth . Leo tells him that he is ill and Marcel is sad but accepting . When he brings Marcel along to meet some former gay friends , however , tension between them boils to the surface , setting the stage for a riveting conclusion . Although I was uncomfortable with scenes in bed involving physical contact between the brothers , I feel that the sincerity of Close to Leo and the brilliant performances by Lespert and Mignard more than tip the scales in its favor . Seeing events unfold from the young boy 's perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the Quebecois film Leolo and Truffaut 's The 400 Blows . Unlike some American films that dance around the anguish of AIDS , Close to Leo tells a harsh truth but does so in a way that is tender and wonderfully real .  
0	  A little girl 's dead body is found stripped of all possible means of identification . When it is discovered that one leg is longer than the other , it is assumed to be the body of a couple 's missing daughter . After this trauma , the couple separates and the mother becomes addicted to tranquilizers and leads a miserable existence . All of this changes when one day , many years later , she receives a phone call from her daughter ! With the help of an ex-cop and a reporter , she sets out on a journey to determine if her daughter is indeed alive . " Los Sin Nombre " is a mess plot-wise , moves at an achingly slow pace , and is completely unscary . The saving grace is Emma Vilarasau , who does an outstanding job as the desperate mother . The best part of the movie is the ending , but I 'm not sure it is worth enduring the rest of the film . Beware of the English subtitles on the recent R1 release-they aren't very accurate .  
1	  Prior to seeing Show People , my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick , and slapstick only . I could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous pratfalls . But this masterful film proved me wrong . Davies , in my view , was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to Lucille Ball . I mention Lucy primarily because Davies ' mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that I wonder if Davies wasn't one of Ball 's primary influences . This is coming from a 21 year old who had never before seen silent comedy , and I must say that no matter how much of the period-specific references you actually get ( I didn't , apparently ) , you will not be bored by this movie . You will probably even laugh more than you would at most talkie comedies . This is not only my favorite silent comedy , but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time .  
1	  It 's a shame that this piece of work wasn't acknowledged as a piece of work . It has everything a historical film must have : a serious historical research , outstanding performances of every actor involved and a discrete but great direction . When I saw the movie I knew it should be a prototype for every biographical movie .  
1	  I really liked this version of ' Vanishing Point ' as opposed to the 1971 version . I found the 1971 version quite boring . If I can get up in the middle of a movie a few times ( as I did with the 1971 version ) than to me , it is not all that great . Of course , this could be due to the fact that I was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out . However , I have seen many remakes , where I have liked the original and older one better . I found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without undermining the meaning of the 1971 version . In my opinion , I felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasn't so " blase " . ( Boring )  
1	  The only other film besides Soylent Green that has such an air of hopelessness is On the Beach . Both films deal with the consequences for the species and the planet from man made cataclysms . On the Beach with nuclear war and Soylent Green with the environmental poisoning of the planet . Maybe there 's cause for some optimism because as of 2007 we haven't reached either of the worlds described in those films and we were supposed to by now . New York City still has about 8 million people not the 22 million by the turn of the millenia as described in Soylent Green . Environmentalists always hail this film as showing the consequence of global warming . For myself it also shows the Right to Life ethic run amuck . Obviously there 's no family planning in this world either . Charlton Heston is an NYPD detective who lives with room mate Edward G. Robinson who 's old enough to remember the Earth before catastrophe struck . There 's been a murder committed , Joseph Cotten an executive with the Soylent Corporation , a multi-national concern that has come up with a food product , some kind of wafer in many colors to feed the world 's population . It 's latest product is Soylent Green . The investigation finds Charlton Heston getting his man , but also it leads to some horrifying truths about the Soylent Corporation and the future of mankind . As Heston shouts in the end that Soylent Green is made of people , that we 've become a race of cannibals , the horrifying thing is that there is no alternative . We 've exhausted the planet and we have to eat our dead to survive . This was the farewell performance of Edward G. Robinson and in his memoirs Heston spoke movingly of Robinson even though they had differing political views . A few weeks after Robinson wrapped that final scene of his screen demise by consented euthanasia , he passed away in real life . Not many did , but Heston knew that Robinson was terminally and there was no acting involved in that final death scene between the two of them . Though the timetable was off , it doesn't mean that the world envisioned by Soylent Green may not come to pass . Hopefully we 'll have not just the intelligence , but the sense of shared responsibility to keep that from happening .  
0	  This movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off . I know these horrible things happen in the world , but Im watching movies based on the fact that what Im watching is not actually happening on the screen . These live animal clips are not meant to be in movies , they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other species . This should be banned and destroyed . I have also contacted Netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market ! This movie should be removed from the public . The person who made this movie needs psychological help .  
0	  The fifth " Black Emanuelle " I 've watched has , potentially , the most intriguing plot line dealing as it does with the intrepid female reporter investigating the white slavery / prostitution racket which takes her from San Francisco to Rome to Macao and back to her own hometown , New York ! The film is peopled with past veterans of the series which , inexplicably , play completely different roles , namely Ivan Rassimov ( appearing here as a head of a United Nations committee for Third World countries ! ) , Karin Shubert ( as a feminist rival reporter ) and Don Powell ( as Rassimov 's chauffeur ) . Unfortunately , as usual with this type of film ( despite their being shown in the dead of night ) , it is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene ( described in " Stracultr ) in which an Asian slave trader gets his comeuppance by being sodomized by a dog is nowhere to be seen here ! Still , a harrowing sequence late in the film when a sleazy politician tricks a couple of girls ( including , naturally , Gemser and Shubert ) into a midnight rendezvous under a New York bridge with a group of bums ( this is the way he gets their votes , get it ! ) - with his high society pals giddily looking on - seems pretty much intact . The most ridiculous element of this entry - apart from Gemser 's penchant to disrobe completely every time she enters a house ( even in front of perfect strangers ) - is her excursion to India to interview a charlatan / Guru ( George Eastman made up to look considerably Christ-like ! ) who has found a way to prolong coitus indefinitely ; of course , when Emanuelle calls him up on it , he ends up having premature ejaculation .. !  
1	  Your average garden variety psychotic nutcase ( deliciously essayed with unhinged glee by Stephen Sachs ) knocks off various dim-witted young " adults " ( to use the term very loosely ) in Dayton Hall University , which is being closed down for demolition . Featuring dreadful acting by the entire cast ( Daphne Zuniga makes her ignominious and inauspicious film debut here as Debbie , a bimbo who has her head crushed by a car ! ) , a hefty corpse tally of 10 , okay make-up f / x by Matthew Mungle , a few bloody murders ( baseball bat bludgeoning , chicken wire strangulation , your standard drill through the head bit , that sort of gruesome thing ) , a downbeat surprise twist ending which was later copied in " Intruder , " a creepy score by Christopher ( " Hellraiser " ) Young , a slight smidgen of gratuitous female nudity , and endearingly incompetent direction by Jeffrey Obrow and Steve Carpenter ( who also blessed us with " The Power " and " The Kindred " ) , this entertainingly abysmal slice'n'dice atrocity sizes up as a good deal of delectably dopey and drecky low-grade fun .  
1	  Very interesting and moving documentary about the World Trade Center tragedy on 11th September 2001 . The main theme of it is the heroism of American fire-fighters who tried to rescue as many people as they could . The film is deeply emotional and rather disturbing-many people seen on screen have lost their lives ! Recommended .  
1	  Interesting how much more realistic Brosnan 's performance is to that of the original James Bond novels when compared to the bond films . He 's neurotic , paranoid , an alcoholic and a womanizer to boot . This is perfect break for him , even so much as to make fun of the bond icon . " I 'm a mess , a parody of myself " he says . It doesn't get any better than that . I just finished reading Dr. No and this is very much how Ian Fleming had portrayed James Bond . Personally I never liked Brosnan as Bond because he fit the icon too closely . There was nothing for him to personalize the character with , as compared to Roger Moore or Sean Connery . Its great to see Brosnan play a character both grounded in reality and flamboyantly off the wall . A shallow character trying to come to an understanding on deeper emotional and psychological issues to which he has no background dealing with . It 's an impressive portrayal , and having Greg Kinear to ground him , is just poetic . This movie reminds me a little bit of dynamics established between the main characters in " My Blue Heaven " , but more genuine in their coping mechanisms .  
1	  Not to mention easily Pierce Brosnon 's best performance . Of course Greg Kinnear is always great . Really , when has he really been bad ? I think this film is incredibly underrated ! The use of colors in this movie is something very different in today 's film world where every other movie has the Payback blue filter . I also love the way they used the song by Asia . Proving that even what was once thought of as kinda cheesy can be really cool placed correctly . I was making my first feature when this came out . Being that my film was a hit-man movie , I had to check out anything in the genre that was released . After seeing it , I 'm sure it had some effect on me through the process . It was pretty cool when my film got on the IMDb that it would recommend this film if you liked mine . How any of the others relate I have no idea , making an even more interesting coincidence . $U$  
1	  Though I really didn't feel anything for Lance 's character , and felt his wife could have done much better with anyone else . It could have been a much stronger movie if they had spent more time on character development , perhaps with Lance - I would have liked it better . However , I have to completely agree with DoyleLuver , when they said " And to quote Glenn Quinn 's character Ben : ' I 'm the star here in it , that 's right I 'm the talented one ! ' " If you watch the movie , just watch him , even when he 's in the background .. just his facial expressions , all in the eyes , you KNOW for sure what motivates Ben , exactly how he feels about comments , even if it 's a quick look behind a character 's back . Great acting in a fair film .  
0	  We gave up at the point where George Clooney 's character has his finger-nails extracted . We were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like . To say this film was incomprehensible , boring , pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it ! How did people manage to sit through this confusing , slow , depressing pseud 's corner of a film , let alone nominate it for an Oscar ? Clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him . What was he thinking ? Oh .. and what was with those subtitles ? - did we just have a dud DVD or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air ? The film was hard enough to follow without that as well . I pity the cast , who obviously did their best with the material available .  
1	  If you 've had drama in your life , either your own or by someone close to you , the stages of pain this woman ( but , in my opinion , it could easily have been a man too ) goes through are very very real . It is a movie about not being able to cope with your pain , about not knowing what to do to help yourself get through it . Obviously it then also is a movie about not knowing how to help someone close to you get through their pain . It is a movie that makes you realize that everyone is alone in their suffering . It is a movie that might push someone over the edge .. which hardly sounds like a recommendation . I 'm not sure I would recommend someone to go see this film , especially someone close , but for me .. it is a movie that puts things into perspective , that shows real pain , and is therefore much relevant to being alive . It makes you realize that hey , you or the person close to you have lived through pain , that hey , all the things you worry about now are of so little importance  
0	  Another weak third-season entry , ' Is There In Truth No Beauty ? ' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say , fascinating . The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane . It 's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise . Obviously , I think , it was a mistake to ever ' show ' the alien , as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up ; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes , usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar . In any event , Kollos ' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock , and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor . ( For the longest time , I thought the alien 's name was ' Carlos , ' which I found humorous , but I digress . ) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety . This is accomplished , but when Spock / Kollos go back to end the mind-meld , by golly , Spock forgets his visor . Uh oh . He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos ' assistant , a blind woman with psychic powers . This might have been a really bizarre , excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series ' last season .  
0	  ' The Curse of Frankenstein ' sticks faithfully to Mary Shelley 's story for one word of the title , which wouldn't be so bad if the changes were any good at all . The tragedy of the creature destroying Frankenstein 's family has been completely excised and replaced with .. nothing . The heart and moral centre of the story is gone . It doesn't help that this Frankenstein is a conniving , devious murderer ; he deserves everything he gets . The plot is basically a shallow checklist of Frankenstein clichés . Even taken on its own terms , this is rubbish : a bland , rambling film featuring a shite-looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut . As it 's the first of Hammer 's horror films , directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee , its place in horror history is secure . But it 's crap .  
1	  I anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly cliché , but I was completely wrong ! Charlie Cox ( I had never heard of him until now ) played an incredibly good leading man ; he was so earnest and romantic , me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him . Claire Danes , who I did like before ( LOVED her in Romeo and Juliet ) , made me enjoy her even more . Her acting was fantastic , I couldn't even tell that she was American . The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was extremely good , the casting was quite perfect . Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well-casted ; DeNiro as that gay pirate .. priceless , priceless . I laughed so hard at that one scene where Septimus comes on the ship .. oh my god , wow . Pfeiffer played a decent villain , I liked her as the snippy mother in Hairspray . But she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie . Overall , it was funny ( but not slap-stick at all ! ) , romantic , the special effects weren't totally frequent but when they were , they were great ; the cameos from Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well-placed . I totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the Princess Bride or even Lord of the Rings . It kept my interest the entire time and I will be buying the DVD when it comes out !  
0	  I 'm gettin ' sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one-line synopsis then end up being equal to what you 'd find in the bottom center of a compost heap . Who knows : " Witchery " may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios , even with a " big name cast " ( like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink , nudge-nudge ) and the effervescent likes of Hildegard Knef ( I dunno , some woman .. ) . But on film , it just falls apart faster than a papier-mache sculpture in a rainstorm . Seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the Eastern seaboard , and one of them ( a woman , I 'd guess ) is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque , tortuous ways . Okay , right there you have a cross-section of plots from " The Exorcist " , " The Omen " , " Ten Little Indians " and a few other lesser movies in the satanic worshippers run amok line . None of it is very entertaining and for the most part , you 'll cringe your way from scene to scene until it 's over . No , not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help matters much . They 're just in it to pick up a paycheck and don't seem very intent on giving it their " all " . From the looks of it , Hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with Pam Anderson ( and who can blame him ? ) and Linda .. well , who knows ; a celebrity PETA benefit or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is she 's in to nowadays . And the torture scenes ! Ecchh . You 'll see people get their mouths sewn shut , dangled up inside roaring fireplaces , strung up in trees during a violent storm , vessels bursting out of their necks , etc , etc . Sheesh , and I thought " Mark of the Devil " was the most sadistic movie I 'd seen .. Don't bother . It 's not worth your time . I can't believe I told you as much as I did . If you do watch it , just see if you can count the cliches . And yes , Blair gets possessed , as if you didn't see THAT coming down Main Street followed by a marching band . No stars . " Witchery " - these witches will give you itches .  
0	  Well , it 's all been said about this movie and I hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what 's to be said . But the thing is , I have seen zillions of movies and I am working on writing reviews on all the movies that I 've seen . So , I have to write something . The acting is stupid . It 's truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash . The nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child . the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be . Don't they realize that even rip-offs can still be scary . We don't see how the granpa is killed . The dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die , you just don't sympathize with them . And uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better . We just hear him scream and we see nothing !  
0	  This Paramount version / ripoff of OKLAHOMA ! / ANNIE GET YOUR GUN / CALAMITY JANE isn't all that unusual or innovative . The marketing and intro comments may be there to salvage what is really a pretty bad movie musical western shot on a soundstage and like a live TV show . I don't find the use of the background cyclorama , lit in various scenes with yellow , or pink , or red , or .. all that innovative . As noted , it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a TV budget : All soundstage , with minimal sets backed by the lighted cycs ! ( Compare to NEW FACES ( OF 1952 ) . The actors come off reasonably well , though . And this style was much better realized when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959 . Of couorse , this movie suggests the often repeated question : " what were they thinking ? "  
1	  Barman directed Any Way the Wind Blows as he would sing a dEUS song . Anarchy rules over a logical and common strain of thoughts . The story behind this movie just goes any which way the wind blows . And that can truly be refreshing to watch , if you are prepared and willing that is . Viewers who state that there is nothing to keep the story-lines together are right . Who the hell is that Windman anyway ? Still , I really enjoyed this movie . Antwerp is a beautiful , bustling , happening place and Any Way captures that feeling . It also captures the silliness , the racism , the bureaucracy , the addictions and the violence that survives undetected in a seemingly friendly city . The movie is entertaining , funny and a little shallow . Barman 's screen debut will not make as heavy an impact as his music debut . In that light some might be disappointed . But then again , ' Worst Case Scenario ' would be a subtle subtitle for Any Way the Wind Blows .  
1	  I had fun watching this movie , mainly due to Simon Pegg , who has quickly become a solid box office draw for comedy films . He is hired from his dead end London publishing job by big shot NYC media mogul Jeff Bridges , as a writer , for one of his celebrity rags . After paying his dues , he makes it into the higher echelons of celebrity writing hackdom ( the " seventh room " ) , where he gets to be a minor celebrity himself . The storyline is very funny , and Gillian Anderson puts in an impressive supporting role as a cutthroat publicity agent . Along the way to success , he finds the true meaning of love , etc . The formulaic plot aside , the movie was very funny , mainly due to Simon Pegg , Jeff Bridges , and Gillian Anderson . Kirsten Dunst was good as the love interest . The rest of the supporting cast did its job well . This was a good comedy & well worth checking out at the theaters .  
1	  Basically the exact same movie as " House of Wax " - Vincent Price 's first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares , because " The Mad Magician " offers just as many sheer thrills , delightful period set-pieces , joyous 3-D effects , sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor ! " Never change a winning team " is exactly what writer Crane Wilbur must have thought when he penned down Price 's character Don Gallico , another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him . Don Gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as Gallico the Great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history ; entitled " The Girl and the Buzz Saw " . Gallico 's promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer Ross Ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose , stating that all of Gallico 's inventions are the rightful property of the company . The sleazy and relentless Ormond , who by the way also ransacked Gallico 's once beloved wife , takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of Gallico 's rival The Great Rinaldi . Inevitably Gallico snaps and sadistically butchers Ormond , but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victim 's image and even starts leading a double life . " The Mad Magician " is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50 's horror movie in Grand Guignol style , with a whole lot of improbably plot twists ( the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist ? ) and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross-out moments ( although they obviously remain suggestive for most part ) . The 3-D delights near the beginning of the film , like a yo-yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains , merely just serve as time-filler and contemporary 50 's hype , but it 's still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them . " The Mad Magician " is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view , as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of Alice Prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era . Needless to state that Vincent Price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film , as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in . Like no other actor could ever accomplish , Price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way . You pity Don Gallico , yet at the same time you fear him enormously . You support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death . Vincent Price simply was a genius actor and , in my humble opinion , the embodiment of the horror genre .  
1	  Before I comment about this movie , you should realize that when I saw this movie , I expected the typical crap , horror , B-movie and just wanted to have fun . Jack Frost is one that not only delivers but is actually one of the best that I 've seen in a long time . Scott McDonald is great as Jack Frost , in fact I think he has a future in being psychopaths in big time movies if ever given the chance . McDonald is a serial killer who becomes a snowman through some stupid accidental mix of ridiculous elements . As soon as that snowman starts moving around and killing people , though , you will find it hard not to laugh . The lines that are said are completely retarded but really funny . The fact that the rest of the cast completely over-acts just adds to stupidity of the film , but it 's stupidity is it 's genius . The scene where the snowman is with the teenage girl is truly classic in B-movie , horror film fashion . I truly hope there is a sequel and I 'll be right there to watch it on whatever cable channel does it . Of course it 's only fun to watch the first few times and it 's not exactly a good work of motion picture technology , but I just like to see snowmen kill people . I gave it a 7 out of 10 , this is a great movie for dates and couples in the late hours .  
1	  I saw it in a posh movie theater where the audience is usually white , educated , and urban . The showing I attended had a sprinkling of African-Americans , and it made the difference in audience-reaction between the two groups a wonderful social commentary on the state of race relations in this country . Basically , the white folks were AFRAID to laugh or laughed nervously at the funny bits - and there are many ! - because they 'd be " laughting at Blacks " , while the Blacks also stayed pretty silent because many couldn't laugh at themselves in front of the whites . I , on the other hand , being Asian ( and thus belonging to neither group ) , had a great time viewing this satire of rap culture and its egos / trappings / values / pseudo-philosophies . The cast is talented and does at great job becoming the characters portrayed . The songs are too funny to be believed . This film is one of the best pseudo-documentaries to come along , including " A Mighty Wind "  
1	  The film gets my stamp of approval . The scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue . This is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of film . Dickinson 's character Kate is very well developed and her performance is felt throughout the entire film . The best work Angie Dickinson did since Point Blank !  
1	  This has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an Austen novel . Although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular " Pride and Prejudice , " " Emma " is a lush and relatively faithful TV version of Austen 's novel - especially considering its short length . The biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one , as the unnecessary snobbishness that Austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to Emma 's character in the rest of the book . I thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well-picked . Kate Beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in Gwyneth Paltrow 's ' 96 version . Samantha Morton 's wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the Harriet we know from the book . Mister Knightly 's role is carried out extremely well in my opinion ; both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much-neglected , sumptuous film .  
0	  Feeding The Masses was just another movie trying to make a little money off of the zombie craze that is going around , mostly due to the popularity of movies such as Land Of The Dead and the Resident Evil series . It starts at a television station , which is guarded by the military , and are reporting that The Lazarus Virus ( zombies ) are close to containment and the city will soon be free to do their business again . The problem is , this is totally false . Zombies are running rampantly and only a small minority of people are aware . Among them are Torch ( William Garberina ) , the camera man , Sherry ( Rachael Morris ) , the lead anchor woman ( who for some reason is listed as playing Shelly on this website ) and Roger ( Patrick Cohen ) , their military escort . Torch and Sherry are against lying to the people but the station is being run by secret service ( or some other government agency ) and they are heavily censored . This movie gives itself a pat on the back on the box-cover saying " We hold FEEDING THE MASSES on a higher level than any o the three ' of the Dead ' films by George A. Rombero . " The source of that quote has lost ALL credibility with me . Let me just say that this movie is BAD . I don't mean bad like I was expecting more ( I obviously was , though ) but I mean bad in that I could not find any redeeming qualities in the film , whatsoever . The acting in all parts are either over done or too wooden . Did anybody remember their lines or are they reading off of cue cards ? I can't even think of what the best part of the movie was or the best actor / actress . There really was not one . If I had to give a nod to someone , I would say Roger , the military escort was probably the most interesting character but that is really not saying much . I would have to recommend to pass on this movie , despite the box-cover looking pretty good ( It 's what originally drew me to the movie ) . 3/10  
1	  This movie has been made by one of the most absurd humorists in Canada , Yves P. Pelletier . I was shocked for a second that he made a ROMANTIC comedy , but knowing he was a heavy cinephile , was seen in every local festival and in the local cinematheque , I had a positive feeling about this movie . Hell , I was right . Right off the bat , the scenario ( written by Pelletier himself ) is a bit twisted and hard to follow , but , in Pelletier 's fashion it 's a one of a kind 90 minutes jack in the box . Loosely inspired and mostly transformed allusion to Dangerous Liaisons ( by Laclos ) " Les Aimants " consists of a twisted game of writing notes on the fridge . Throughout the movie you 'll get the occasion to find out who 's who and who 's writing to who on that goddam fridge .. which pops up in an interesting love affair . Great storyline , great photography , great quotations of other movies . Should we ask more for a first movie ?  
1	  I rented this some years ago , the video store had only VHS at the time . Straight to video was hitting it 's strides ( you know , where the box covers use the same font and color schemes of successful films ) . I didn't know what to expect other than what was printed . First thing I thought while watching was " what the hells ' wrong with the sound ? " - Obviously there was no dialogue dubbing . Words echoed , so I stopped munching on whatever I had to pay closer attention-mind you there 's no Shakespeare here ! , just simple talk . The story is simple enough , boy meets girl etc .. What struck me as humorous and heartfelt was , the people in the movie didn't seem like caricatures written into the story , but rather non-actors plucked temporarily from their real jobs ( uniforms included ) . All the while , you begin to sense what the filmmaker is after , then see that there are no attempts at cheap humor ( people hurting their privates , using vulgarities this couldn't have hurt the marketing . There was something honest about it . I thought if they 'd have a bigger budget then it would have been better , which i 'm sure they considered daily , but , they went ahead and made it . This , I felt , was what independent film-making is all about . The word " Indy " , is thrown around as if it 's a Genre .. Ha ! .. that 's funny !  
1	  If you loved Long Way Round you will enjoy this nearly as much . It is educational , funny , interesting and tense . Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates , two tired mechanics , two excellent cameramen and too much Russ . Ewan makes a few appearances but Charley really pulls it off alone . He is funny , engaging and still a puddle of stress and doubt . Great stuff ! The series wraps up in 7 episodes . Like LWR , the preparation is nearly as interesting as the race . Though they cover the ins and outs of the race well , there could be a bit more explanation of the trucks and cars , which are merely mentioned and rarely even seen racing . It is a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two wheels will love this . The series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of peoples mouths . Yikes . There is another extremely catchy theme song like LWR but this one is not nearly as good as the Stereophonics . If you live in the US god knows when it will be released so buy it on Amazon . uk and watch it on your computer as I did . Oh , and be prepared to buy another motorbike .  
1	  Three sergeants in the British army stationed in India , are sent out to stop an uprising of a tribe of murderers known as the Thuggees . One of the sergeants , Cutter , leads away from the camp in search of a golden temple and is captured by the Thuggees lead by the sinister Guru . Gunga Din , the regiment 's water boy , goes back to the camp for help and the other two sergeants go after him , but are also captured . Now the major sends a full detail out after the three , but do not realize that they are walking into a trap set by the Thugees . It is though , Gunga Din who saves the day . Excellently made buddy film , even though it is today politically incorrect . Grant , McLaglen , and Fairbanks do give very humorous and thrilling performances with Jaffe very well in the title role and Cianelli very sinister as Guru . Rating - 10 out of 10 .  
0	  I saw not so fabulous rating on IMDb , but I went to see it anyway , because I am a big fan of Bible related material . First thing that bothered me was a little too much Indiana Jones wannabe movie , but it also looked like Casper Van Dien didn't see those Jones movies through ( but he should ) . I believe he tried his best , but script just stunk . Music tried to be kinda Jones style too . Great work , but for such movie it seemed like too much work , like the video part did't deserve all that great music . Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills , he did a good job , but somehow the script was bringing everything down . " Jokes " are old school , somewhere 20 years old ; they brought only cynic smile to my face . There are some really bad camera angels , SFX looks like homemade and unrealistic . Kevin VanHook had probably a good idea on the story ( in my opinion , but I love such stories ) , but things just didn't work out in the end . Maybe he should put it on a paper when it was still fresh in his head . When I ( in first minutes ) saw that movie was going to be one of those ' low budget movies ' , I hoped that I will at least ' hear ' a good story , but sometimes movies just disappoint .  
0	  There is a scene near the beginning after a shootout where horses are running . If something red catches your eye it is because a white van is parked behind a bush by the trail . I thought I had seen bad but this is it . A white van in a western . Did they not catch this ? Oh well , and I paid top dollar at the rental . It will make you want to grab your buddies and have them all put in 10 grand and make a better movie . The talking was so so slow , the acting was mostly OK but couldn't be taken seriously due to the poor nature of the filming . There is a door at the sheriffs that looks like a door today with the particular trimming . I say watch this movie , and move Cabin boy into # 2 on the worst of all time .  
0	  Sadly , it 's true . " Legiunea sträinä " exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of Daneliuc 's irreversible failure . As it was already said , the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form . Maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy , he only gathers a disordered pile of events , unable to follow the least story-line . The script 's level is similar to a " Cântarea României " amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism - only , turned upside down : while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism , now Daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology . The ideas content is zero , and the " message " , infantile and didactic , at a kindergarten level . Unfortunately , he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets . He isn't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation , to order it in a correct movie scene , to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar . His level of story-telling in film-images is similar to phrasing something like : " Holy sheet man it ain't nuthin right ' ere , and all da people is asses ! " What a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976-1984 , who had created unique works as " Cursa " , " Proba de microfon " , " Vânätoarea de vulpi " - and even " Croaziera " and " Glissando " .. Sic transit gloria mundi ..  
1	  hello . i just watched this movie earlier today for the 14th time in 3 days . i am a history teacher that has wayy too much time on my hands . i need a life . i found the movie containing a striking resemblance to broke back mountain . i also found that i look a lot like jean Lafitte if he were white . also , my favorite line in the entire movie was from Mr. Petey - " this baby can shoot a chipmunk 's eye from 300 yards ! " oh , and my favorite scene in the movie was when the British were coming in , and the one drummer who was so devoted to his work , and he drummed till the death , as if that drum would end the war altogether .. but it wouldn't . well , thats all i would like to say about this movie . OH , one more thing .. bonnie brown is an insane physco bipolar mood swinging BEEYOTCH . that is all .  
1	  Mating Game is a charming , wonderful movie from an era gone by . Hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie . My wife and I would go see it . It is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I watched on AMC . This movie has Tony Randall at his best . Debbie Reynolds is great , as always . Loved it . We plan on ordering on DVD to add to our growing collection of movies . Too bad Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore . Hey Hollywood .. time to dig some of these type of scripts out of the old safe , update them a bit ( without spoiling the original movie and script as you have done with other remakes ) , and hold a casting call . A remake would be a big hit on the silver screen , DVD , and on cable / SATTV . SN Austin , TX  
0	  My brother is an avid DVD collector . He took one look at the cover ( two models on toilets ) and had to add it to his collection . I stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie ( I use that term loosely ) I 've felt obligated to sit through . I dared not make eye contact with my brother , quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist . The biggest name in the whole movie is Michael Clark Duncan who appears in one scene , which the " filmmaker " decided to show every take of ( about four total ) throughout the movie . In fact , the whole movie pretty much follows this suit . The fact that the DVD contained deleted footage was a shock . ( I went to bed without viewing it , however ) . To no surprise at all , I found this disc without its case behind the TV about a week later .  
1	  This movie had an interesting cast , it mat not have had an a list cast but the actors that were in this film did a good job . Im glad we have b grade movies like this one , the story is basic the actors are basic and so is the way they execute it , you don't need a million dollar budget to make a film just a mix of b list ordinary actors and a basic plot . I like the way they had the street to themselves and that there was no one else around and also what i though was interesting is that they didn't close down a café to set there gear and that they did it all from a police station . Arnold vosloo and Michael madsen did a great job at portraying there roles in the hostage situation . This was a great film and i hope to see more like it in the near future .  
0	  This film offers absolutely no imagination in it 's premise nor in it 's execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so-called comedy that has no energy to speak of . Story is about nit-picky over analytical insurance risk manager Reuben Feffer ( Ben Stiller ) who finds his new wife Lisa ( Debra Messing ) cheating on him with a scuba instructor ( Hank Azaria ) after only one day on their honeymoon . Upon returning home Reuben and his best friend Sandy ( Philip Seymour Hoffman ) go to a party and run into Polly Prince ( Jennifer Aniston ) whom they went to school with years earlier . * SPOILER ALERT * Polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who Reuben is as a person but they start to date and Reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods . But one day Lisa comes back and wants to remain married to Reuben but he really doesn't want to but Polly decides to leave as she doesn't believe in marriage to begin with . This film is the second directing effort by John Hamburg who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in " Zoolander " and " Meet the Parents " but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel . It 's very easy to say something is not funny but I think with this film it 's even easier to figure out why . This film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if it 's only happening because of the ridiculousness of the script . Hamburg who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as " There 's Something About Mary " but instead the events seem incredibly forced . Did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny ? If you do , your easy ! A few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious . Stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film doesn't work as a comedy or as a romance .  
0	  This is the story of two guys who found a copy of ' Funky Monkey . ' Finding this seemed odd at the time figuring that there are still posters for the movie at the local Cineplex Odeon . After seeing such classics as ' Every Which Way But Loose ' and ' Project X , ' these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome . These guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie . There was some monkey that was replaced by a Stunt MAN when action sequences were required . It was apparent that the monkey wasn't trained in the school of Shakespearean acting . Perhaps replacing the monkey with Ben Affleck might have helped the guys thought . Maybe a strong sidekick would help like a Jackie Chan or heck maybe even Hulk Hogan . Luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and Jet Li look-a-like Matthew Modine . While some might argue that Matthew Modine doesn't come close to Jet Li , camera tricks prove that he is every bit as good . When it becomes obvious that an untrained chimp can't handle the movie , the movie leans on Matthew Modine to be the real star . Did I mention that there is some dorky kid that develops a bond with Modine and the monkey ? Is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie ? Even Matthew Modine should get jealous with this one ( because using the pick-up line ' I 'm second fiddle to a monkey ' doesn't seem to work with the ladies . ) Shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from Matthew Modine telling them ' Seven days . '  
1	  The first time my best friend and I sat down to watch this movie , we were watching it for Alex Winter of " Bill & Ted 's " fame . We didn't know what to expect other than who and what it was about . By the time the movie was over , we knew that it was love at first sight . This movie , while not completely historically accurate , was and is the best one of its genre . I have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion , none of the others can compare . It fibbed a little at certain details , but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story . I have seen the other movies about this summer and I find most of them to be good , but none as captivating as this one . " Haunted Summer " has the qualities of a painting . The colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a canvas , framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric 's home . The costumes were gorgeous and , despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world , made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself . The whole movie was set on the picturesque Lake Geneva ( where I hope to one day go because of seeing this movie ) and the serenity that these historical figures found there . This movie shows , besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of England 's harsh judgements , the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well . Yes , there were drugs . It was a fairly common practice during that time , a time when drugs were not illegal . And the taking of laudanum ( the liquid form of opium ) was medicinal as well as recreational . Shelley suffered from consumption . Lord Byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot . It was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer . And they were poets during a time when experience was the key . There was no time for prudish caution . Passion and experience were a big part of the Romantic Era . And out of the thoughts and discussions of science , religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend : " Frankenstein . " Yes , in this movie , we see the beautiful and liberated Mary Godwin ( not married to Shelley at that time ) played by beautiful and talented Alice Krige . She is the control factor to all that goes on until she , too , gives in to experience . But she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms . As was the strength that she inherited from her mother and father . The actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played . The music fitting . The direction captured the essence of the summer , as I 've read about it . This movie was based on a wonderful book " Haunted Summer " by Anne Edwards . If you like this movie , read the book . The author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of Mary Godwin Shelley and the other participants of this story . If you are a person who loves history ( even the little inaccuracies from time to time ) and romance and the gothic , then this is a movie for you . It shows the birth of the birth of the monster , which even today teaches us about the morals of " playing God . " A definite must see movie !  
1	  Wonderful film that mixes documentary and fiction in a way that makes the spectator question : what is the extent of truth in documentary films or is there such a thing as an objective documentary .  
1	  Loved this film . Real people , great acting , humour , unpredictable . The characters were believable and you really connected with them . If you 're looking for a film about slightly offbeat characters outside the mainstream of society and how they help each other , this would be a good choice .  
1	  Trey Parker and Matt Stone , the creators of the show ' South Park ' , return with something entirely different . They create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball . This sport is known as baseketball . It 's like basketball except that the rules of baseball are involved and there 's another letter e in the title . Here 's how you play : you just shoot the ball while these two guys try to distract you from making the shot . Sounds simple . In fact , I might try it one day . After the game hits the streets , it soon becomes a huge success . Who would 've known that 2 immature friends could invent a sport that became so successful ? My opinion ' Baseketball ' is a very crude and silly spoof filled with lots of slapstick violence , yet it actually delivers some laughs and plenty of entertainment . A definite recommendation for those of you who like slapstick and rude humor .  
0	  Recipe for one of the worst movies of all time : a she-male villain who looks like it escaped from the WWF , has terrible aim with a gun that has inconsistent effects ( the first guy she shoots catches on fire but when she shoots anyone else they just disappear ) and takes time out to pet a deer . Then you got the unlikable characters , 30 year old college students , a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lots , lots more . Avoid at all costs .  
0	  I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkind to it ( to say the least ) .. but it was terrible . Really terrible . Badly acted , a witless script , cack handed direction .. Watching this film was like watching a car crash - you want to look away but you keep staring because you want to see how messy it 's going to get . Well , the car is wrecked and there are no survivors . On the plus side , the cinematography was nice , made me want to go on holiday , if only to cleanse myself from this unholy  
0	  This is simply the worst movie I 've ever seen . Neither of the three central characters has any charm , and Erika 's good looks aren't enough to carry the film . The lamest plot I 've ever had inflicted upon me . Also the most unconvincing military comedy ever . Why did they bother ?  
1	  This is an amazing movie and all of the actors and actresses and very good ! Even though some of the actors and actresses weren't very popular in show business it seemed like they have been acting since they were 1 one year old ! It was funny , gross and just all out a very good movie . In most parts I just didn't know what was going to happen next ! I was like I think this is going to happen , wait I think this is going to happen . All age groups will love this movie ! In some parts I couldn't stop laughing , it was so funny , but in some parts I was totally grossed out and I couldn't believe what I was seeing ! I am definitely going to see this movie again ! It is one of those movies where it can't get boring . Every time you see it is so suspenseful . I definitely recommend seeing this movie !  
1	  Care Bears Movie 2 : A New Generation isn't at all a bad movie . In fact , I like it very much . Yes I admit the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit poorly told at times . But Darkheart , while very very dark is a convincing enough shape shifting villain , and Hadley Kay did a superb job voicing him . Speaking of the voice acting , it was great , nothing wrong with it whatsoever . The animation is colourful , and some of the visuals particularly at the beginning were breathtaking . The songs and score are lovely , especially Growing Up and Forever Young , the latter has always been my personal favourite of the two . The care bears , who I do like , are adorable , and the human children are well done too . And the ending is a real tearjerker . All in all , harmless kiddie fun . 8/10 Bethany Cox  
0	  Wow , I hated this movie . The subject matter should have resulted in a really fine film , and the lead actor was definitely sensitive and talented enough to handle the topic , but the script - if there even * was * a script - is a mess . This is less a movie than a random slide show that goes nowhere . I 'd say it goes nowhere fast , except that it 's actually the longest 81 minutes you 'll ever sit through . As I 've mentioned , the lead actor is good . So is Faruza Baulk ( SP ? ) , as his sometimes harsh but ultimately loving and accepting mother . The film makers have a lot to answer for here , because this is a mess . A real shame , because I really wanted to like this movie , but it 's basically out-takes from a movie that never got made . Skip this one - it wasn't even worth the $ 6 I shelled out for pay-per-view .  
1	  Carlos Saura 's Carmen is one of the finest achievements in world , let alone Spanish , cinema . It manages to excite interest in flamenco in its wonderful staged adaptations from Bizet with powerful physical force . At the same time we see the impact of the creation and rehearsal of a new interpretation of Carmen on the choreographer / director and the principle dancers . The fine line between life and art is dazzling .  
0	  This movie was the worst movie ever made on the planet , I like BARNEY more than this movie . The graphics suck , half the movie is animated , the deaths suck , and over all , I was ready to SUE the people that made this movie ! PLEASE DO NOT WASTE HOURS OF YOUR LIFE WATCHING THIS MOVIE . The only good part was when the movie * ended ! This movie is 50 percent Jurassic park , . 1 percent Sabretooth , and 49.9 percent DUMB ! Please do not waste your time watching this movie , you will regret it . You want to know why this movie sucks ? Well , the cover sucked , the graphics sucked , the blood looked ( I mean is ) ketchup , the people tried to blow themselves up , the college students think there all that and can stand up to the animal . I mean , there was a 5 ft . tiger running straight at a woman , she throws a spear at it from 100 ft away ! WAIT TILL YOU CAN Actually HIT IT ! The acting was horrible too . Jurrasic Park is actually a good movie , and this just had to go and ruin it .  
0	  I wish I 'd known more about this movie when I rented it . I 'd put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong cred as an actress ( IMHO ) . While parts of the movie were charming , much of the movie felt contrived , undeveloped , or otherwise just boring or predictable . Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple .. I don't care how big a part of the story line that is , it still felt a bit , um , gross . And Charlie , for a zoologist , she certainly doesn't seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens . What was it about her ( besides her hotness and some common interests ) that made Gray fall for her ? The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth . High points - Molly Shannon ( although I do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion ) , the cabbie in drag , and the dance sequences ( if Sam & Gray were such great dancers , I wish we 'd seen more of that , as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie ) . Could have been better .  
1	  One of the best movies for all ages . You will never be able to look at LION KING again without thinking of the extra history this movie adds . Nearly 40 years old , I watched this with my wife and two sons after work tonight & I have not laughed & enjoyed a movie so much in a long time . Take time out and watch this with the kids . It will remind you of how Disney used to be when you were a young one .  
1	  I first saw a track from this DVD at a hifi show Nov 2006 in London ( i was not really into cream until now ! ) . It was through a high end Arcam system , it sounded great with dts . I had to get this DVD and i 'll tell you this is by far the most exciting music DVD i have ever watched . The performance of Cream at their age was just mind blowing and sound quality is the best i have heard on a music DVD . It does not matter what type of music you like , this one will definitely grow on you . It 's the sheer brilliance of their performance that will make you watch it again and again . Even new musicians don't cut the mustard these days , as these old rockers do .  
1	  This is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever , and may be one of the best movies ever .. It 's got a great plot that functions like a puzzle , with lots of intrigue and suspense . This film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions , with people hiding their identities and their natures . The characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters . They are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality 's and desires . The fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting . It has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy . There are 5 members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal . The styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film .. When this happens , The director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel . These cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely . One thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death . The director Chang Cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death . This makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective . We actually care when people are killed in this film . This is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed . Some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching . When characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain . At the same time , this is also a fun movie . It has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film . There is bad dubbing , The characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat . Some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic .. all this just adds to the greatness of the film . And lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries . If you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic . Everything goes by so fast ( because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre ) that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is . The lighting and composition are spectacular at times . The camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing .. In the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example , imagine Hitchcock moving at about twice the speed . Chang Cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it 's confines . He doesn't rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film , but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work . He is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people . This is the real package A kung fu movie that delivers on every level . It 's art , it 's trash , it 's emotionally moving , and it 's fun , it has a true sense of morality , but doesn't allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action . I recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not .  
0	  This movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen . From the very first scene , i knew it would be a smash crash . It starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission . As it turns out , the people in it were possessed by some random zombies . Well , some years later , some college kids are pulling some pledge prank . Horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock . Things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non-chalonte manner , with pledge over reacting and over-doing the whole " eager to be popular role " What really took the cake with this one is the final battle . Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with the guns . For example , guns making a noise with no muzzle flash , and vice-versa . this is accompanied by stop-animation zombies ( why they move in stop motion is a mystery ) , cheesy music , and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere . Overall , this movie is crap . Just like so many others you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place .  
1	  This comedy is bound to be good from the get-go . East meets west and east doesn't want to lose .. west doesn't know what losing is like . It starts a little slow but it grabs you very soon and it doesn't let go . This is definitely worth seeing .  
1	  After her Oscar-nominated turn in " Secrets & Lies " , Brenda Blethyn starred in the equally great " Saving Grace " . And let me tell you , this is not the sort of movie that you find every day . After her husband commits suicide , Grace Trevethyn ( Brenda Blethyn ) discovers that his irresponsible financial decisions have left her with a massive debt . Fortunately , she finds a way to make ends meet : marijuana . That 's right , Grace starts cultivating it . Every aspect of this movie was played to great effect ; there isn't a dull moment anywhere in it . And I sure didn't see that end scene coming ! But anyway , you gotta see this movie . You just might feel more than a little festive after seeing it . If nothing else , it might function as a good lesson about knowing one 's finances . But of course , there 's a LOT more to it than that !  
0	  When I first saw the trailer for Prom Night , I have to admit , the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie . So my friend and I saw Prom Night last night and I have to say I must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film , not to mention I am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people . There was no tension , the characters , how was I supposed to care about them ? They had no development what-so-ever , the killer ? ! Oh , my God , this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed , I know it 's a film , but why would a man who never ( or at least we know of ) killed any one before , kill a girl 's family and friends that he 's just obsessed over ? I mean , was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her ? I have no idea , because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror . Donna 's family was just brutally murdered by her teacher , who has become very obsessed over her , he was captured and put in jail . It 's been 3 years and she 's just now getting some peace in her life , she 's even going to her senior prom . But the killer has escaped and still has Donna on his mind , he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends , and the hotel maid , and the bell boy , because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee 's are . Donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un-noticed and can kill people so silently , just , wow . I 'm sorry , I really did want to love this movie , we haven't had a good slasher flick in a long time , but this was just a stupid movie that I was not impressed with . Just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious . I know that this was a PG-13 movie , but I just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes ? Not to mention no stab holes ? I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone unless you 're a teen , this movie was made for the teenagers , not adults , and not for those who know a real horror movie , no offense to those who did enjoy this film , but I don't understand how anyone could . 2/10  
1	  In 2006 , the AMPAS awarded one of the most innovative documentaries depicting wildlife in the coldest place on Earth , that film was March of the Penguins narrated by Academy Award Winning Actor Morgan Freeman . Walt Disney Studios has had a monopoly on the animated circuit for decades now . They 've taken their stabs at live action film making and it 's been hit and miss all across the board . Disney then created a sub-division called Disneynature and release its first feature film titled Earth . This is absolutely one of the most touching and informative documentaries I 've seen in quite sometime . Narrated by the great James Earl Jones , Earth doesn't offer anything new to anyone who has watched the Discovery Channel in the past five years or follows the Global Warming crisis very closely . Earth touches very deeply on the issue and takes a very liberal approach on the subject matter . It enables an emotional connection to nature that I haven't experienced before . It also shows not only the beauty and mystifying parts of our gorgeous planet , but the grunt and disturbing aspects that it often entails . It 's one thing to watch " Mufasa " fall from a cliff in to a stampede or Bambi 's mother be shot by a hunter in the middle of the woods . It 's all good because at the end of the film we know it is , just that , a film . This shows penguins , polar bears , elephants , all types of families , from all walks of life , living and dying in their natural habitats . These real things make a real movie experience . Though a bit heavy-weight on the graphic nature of the film ( which many people will disagree ) , Earth is a touching experience . There is stunning cinematography work here by a great camera team and an amazing score by George Fenton . In comparison to March of the Penguins or Grizzly Man , it doesn't really hold any measure but it stands great on its own . At the end of the day , you grow an appreciation of our planet and a bit of sadness as many of us will probably never get to visit these places we 'll witness in the film . We live here yet it 's like we never get to explore the planet for one reason or another . Earth is beautiful . * / *  
0	  Well .. the movie was a fun watch . The main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by . Like vampires that walk in the sunlight . Though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies . A scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams " Ow this hurts .. It 's really stuck . " Then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while . And there are random dream sequenes ' that really don't help with the plot . Come to think of it , nothing really made sense , but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect . Come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful , and the zombies were just fun to watch . Slowly as i write more of this I like this movie more . But you know , all in all you can't expect Schindlers List but its a fun watch .  
1	  I think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943 , though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness . The film is set in 1940-just before the entry of the US into the war . Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family . He 's a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture . Bette Davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time . As the film begins , they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years , they are going to relax and stop running . The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent-making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems . While this had a very noble goal at the time , it just seems phony today . In particular , the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true . It sounded more like anti-Fascism speeches than the voices of real children . They were as a result extremely annoying-particularly the littlest one who came off , at times , as a brat . About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them ( though he had no discernible accent ) . It 's really tough to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog , as it just doesn't sound true to life . The story was based on the play by his lover , Lillian Hellman . And , the basic story idea and plot is good , .. but the dialog is just bad at times . Overall , an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments , .. but that 's really about all .  
1	  I absolutely LOVED this movie when I was a kid . I cried every time I watched it . It wasn't weird to me . I totally identified with the characters . I would love to see it again ( and hope I wont be disappointed ! ) . Pufnstuf rocks ! I was really drawn in to the fantasy world . And to me the movie was loong . I wonder if I ever saw the series and have confused them ? The acting I thought was strong . I loved Jack Wilde . He was so dreamy to an 10 year old ( when I first saw the movie , not in 1970 . I can still remember the characters vividly . The flute was totally believable and I can still ' feel ' the evil woods . Witchy poo was scary - I wouldn't want to cross her path .  
0	  THIS REVIEW IS MOSTLY ALL SPOILERS . IF YOU PLAN ON ENJOYING THIS FILM , DON'T READ THIS REVIEW . That 's the problem with kids TV nowadays . It 's all so patronizing and condescending . ` Wow , that was fun , wasn't it ? ' No it wasn't . And unfortunately it seems to have permeated into children films as well . And that is what ' Flight of the Reindeer ' is all about . Admittedly I haven't seen ' Flight of the Reindeer ' in a few years so I might be hazy on some points , but I remember being thoroughly unimpressed with it at the time . Essentially , the story follows a lecturer who is given a book for Christmas . Now , the lecturer is an esteemed scientist on the flying habits of some animal . I think it was bullfrogs . Anyway , through this book , Mr Lecturer / family man learns that reindeer can fly in exactly the same way as bullfrogs . Apparently this book was written by a scientist many hundreds of years ago who disappeared in the North Pole . Now , if it were me I would have thrown the book out the nearest window . Flying bullfrogs are a naturally occurring phenomenon , but flying reindeer is a fantastic and wholly unrealistic concept . But , Mr lecturer ISN'T me , so I guess that explains why he decides to fly to the north pole leaving his wife and kid at home with no idea where he 's gone . Of course , things go awry and before he knows it , a flying reindeer has crashed into his private plane and he 's stranded at the North Pole . Are you still following this ? Good . His family , of course , are devastated . I would be too , I mean , what a suck-tacular Christmas . Elsewhere , Mr lecturer finds himself in a hidden town at the North Pole inhabited by midgets and one tyrannical figure who dresses only in red and white . Rather than try to escape immediately , as I would have done , he greets everyone there with open arms . This hidden civilization of midget monsters , and he greets them with open arms . Ooo-kayy . They feed him this story that they are the elves of Santa Claus and they spend all year round making toys for kids they have no idea exist . And Mr lecturer accepts all this . He even accepts that Santa Claus is in fact the scientist who disappeared two hundred years ago or whatever . There 's just one problem - they don't want him to leave . The world can't know of their secret existence . After all , before they 'd know it there 'd be a McDonalds and a Starbucks on every street corner . Still with me ? Now , Mr nice guy 's family find the book and assume he 's gone to the North Pole . Boy , wouldn't they be embarrassed if they found out he 'd just gone for a brisk walk ? Before the audience knows it , they 're jetting off to spend a Christmas in the most authentic winter wonderland on the planet . Meanwhile , Mr lecturer gets sick of all the uppity midgets and decides to leave . I can't remember exactly , but I do recall him holding Santa Claus to gunpoint . A fire fight ensues when the midgets attack and he manages to escape via Santa 's sleigh . With Santa hot on his heels and with bloodlust in his eyes , Mr Whatever , through some marvellous co-incidence , finds himself flying alongside his family 's plane that is looking for him . So he jumps on to their plane , the planes flies back and everyone lives happily ever after . The fact is , there have been some shocking films made in the name of Christmas over the years but because they feature that festive charm they get away with it . And it 's that charm that is utterly devoid from ' Flight of the Reindeer ' There isn't much wrong with it ; nothing which insults the intelligence ( well , obviously there IS , but it 's a kids film and thus can get away with such things ) or anything particularly offensive , but the problem is there is nothing much right about it either . It just doesn't FEEL Christmassy . And for a film that is all about Christmas , that it a pretty major flaw . But hey , I don't think ' Flight of the Reindeer 's target audience mind about that ? Why should they ? They 're all so doped up on sedatives they probably couldn't spell ` Christmas ' I give it three out of ten . If it was a TV-Movie then I 'd add another two stars onto it . We all know how bad they can get .  
0	  The film starts with a manager ( Nicholas Bell ) giving welcome investors ( Robert Carradine ) to Primal Park . A secret project mutating a primal animal using fossilized DNA , like ¨Jurassik Park¨ , and some scientists resurrect one of nature 's most fearsome predators , the Sabretooth tiger or Smilodon . Scientific ambition turns deadly , however , and when the high voltage fence is opened the creature escape and begins savagely stalking its prey - the human visitors , tourists and scientific . Meanwhile some youngsters enter in the restricted area of the security center and are attacked by a pack of large pre-historical animals which are deadlier and bigger . In addition , a security agent ( Stacy Haiduk ) and her mate ( Brian Wimmer ) fight hardly against the carnivorous Smilodons . The Sabretooths , themselves , of course , are the real star stars and they are astounding terrifyingly though not convincing . The giant animals savagely are stalking its prey and the group run afoul and fight against one nature 's most fearsome predators . Furthermore a third Sabretooth more dangerous and slow stalks its victims . The movie delivers the goods with lots of blood and gore as beheading , hair-raising chills , full of scares when the Sabretooths appear with mediocre special effects . The story provides exciting and stirring entertainment but it results to be quite boring . The giant animals are majority made by computer generator and seem totally lousy . Middling performances though the players reacting appropriately to becoming food . Actors give vigorously physical performances dodging the beasts , running , bound and leaps or dangling over walls . And it packs a ridiculous final deadly scene . No for small kids by realistic , gory and violent attack scenes . Other films about Sabretooths or Smilodon are the following : ¨Sabretooth ( 2002 ) ¨by James R Hickox with Vanessa Angel , David Keith and John Rhys Davies and the much better ¨10.000 BC ( 2006 ) ¨ by Roland Emmerich with with Steven Strait , Cliff Curtis and Camilla Belle . This motion picture filled with bloody moments is badly directed by George Miller and with no originality because takes too many elements from previous films . Miller is an Australian director usually working for television ( Tidal wave , Journey to the center of the earth , and many others ) and occasionally for cinema ( The man from Snowy river , Zeus and Roxanne , Robinson Crusoe ) . Rating : Below average , bottom of barrel .  
0	  Storyline : The film spanning 4-odd hours covers in adequate details the happenings at the Kargil sector near the LOC in 1999 when the Pakistani infiltrators had crossed the LOC and had entered deep into the Indian territory and the Indian Retaliation . To know more about the story , I would suggest readers to read the news-items pertaining to Kargil . Comment : If one is looking for a formula story in this movie , then one can be sure that it is absent . LOC is a story of Pure sacrifice , patriotism , courage and lots and lots of bullets and Blood . The movie hall where I saw this film was full of whistles and cheers when the Film shows Indian Bravery . Movie audience seemed similar to Audiences like in an India vs Pak cricket match . Watch the movie as a tribute to the Army 's sacrifice and for the characterization of the real-life war heroes ( 4 PVC honoured heroes ) who have sacrificed their lives so that we could see this day . The movie has made a brilliant portrayal of the Army who have battled all odds in rough weather conditions . The film 's negatives are that it is too stretched and the songs are extremely boring .  
0	  I was thirteen years old , when I saw this movie . I expected a lot of action . Since Escape From New York was 16-rated in Germany I entered the movie as fallback . It was so boring . Afterwards I realized that this was just crap where a husband exhibits his wife . I mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access . It is more then 20 years ago , but I am still angry that I waste my time with this film . This is a soft-porno for schoolboys . Undressing Bo Derek and painting her with color - nice . But then they should named the film Undressing Bo and painting her .  
0	  I saw this for free , thankfully , and wish it was better than it was , but it 's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to foist on us in the last ten years . Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple who are opposites - and yet they are attracted to each other . If that plot line doesn't take you by surprise and thrill you , the movie won't either . Lots of sight gags and fart jokes . Halfway through the movie I began to realize that Ben Stiller really isn't that funny , but he tries VERY hard . And Jennifer Anniston really isn't that pretty , but her HAIR looks great . And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman must have got paid a great deal of money to be in this kind of average ho-hum movie , I 've come to expect more from them . What was interesting was that I saw this after I saw American Splendor , which is a truly funny and original movie - and I compared the two in my head , and found myself wishing that the movie executives would be forced to sit through those two movies back to back - perhaps that would knock some sense into them and they 'd start making better movies with unknowns rather than this formulaic stuff that plays best on airplanes .  
0	  Bottom of the Freddy barrel . This is the worst film in the series , beating " Freddy 's Revenge " for that title . A cheap-looking ( with mediocre special effects ) , incoherent mess , with Freddy turned into a punster . He has one or two cool lines , but that doesn't save this illogical and sloppy sequel .  
1	  Not a film to be taken seriously , but a great little film nonetheless . It 's definitely NOT just a piece of fluff . The acting , IMO , is excellent . One of those films you wouldn't go out of your way to see , but it brings a smile every time it comes around on cable . Like an old friend . Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance . - - - - - - - -  
1	  Fever Pitch is a fun enough movie . It has a lot of funny moments ( including a hilariously disturbing shower scene ) . Like most romantic comedies , it has a " dead zone " in the middle where all the heavy , " she 's breaking up with me " stuff happens , but other than that it continues to be funny until the end . Even though the plot revolves around fanaticism towards the Red Sox , it 's not overloaded with sports . You don't have to be a fan to enjoy this film . Of course that 's easy for me to say : I 've been a Red Sox fan since I was a boy , too . 7 out of 10 . Barky  
1	  I own Ralph Bakshis forgotten masterpiece Fire & Ice on an old OOP rental videotape . Well for one thing , this is better than any other Conan-esque film you 'll ever see . Sure , it 's cheesy , but who cares ? It stood the test of time , and the only way it started to look cheesy is in comparisons to modern fantasy epics like LOTR : FOTR ( though I love that film . ) The plot goes like this : After a battle between Fire & Ice , a kings daughter is kidnapped by Jarols ( Ice ) subhuman creatures , while a sole survivor of a victimized village rescues her . Yeah it doesn't sound as a original as Nurse Betty , but that 's not the point . It is really to bring to life an interesting idea of a world of two enemies : Fire & Ice . And it succeeds . As for the action scenes : superb . They are well handled , have terrific suspence , and have plenty of loud noises . Just check out the climatic battle , now THAT 'S an ending ! The acting and dialogue : competent . Really . They aren't gonna be nominated for an Oscar , but they are OK and don't get on your nerves . The animation is quite good . Shot on 3D and rotoscoped ( I THINK ) , it looks pretty good . A lot of the backgrounds look really detailed and well drawn , and although the character designs feel a little 1-dimentional , they are OK . Overall , this is a fine neglected little gem and will entertain you more than any of the superfical " entertainment " . 10/10  
0	  I attended one of the premieres last night and have the following observations : 1 . Just because you 've directed a ton of music videos DOES NOT make you qualified to make movies . The movie had an overabundance of lingering shots that made no sense , horrible angles , and terrible lighting . The editing didn't help this mess at all . When " Dixie " shows up late for the memorial service her mother remarks about her hand but it 's never clear what the heck she 's talking about . 2 . The plot had promise , but the script was thin and full of Ford Truck sized holes . We never get to understand what drives the characters , what 's really behind the conflicts they all have with each other or exactly how they resolve them . Sixteen years of distance is wiped out in 4 days seemingly by magic . The deep conversations were marred by stupid clichés . ( In fact , the whole town was one big cliché of southern life . ) Half the audience groaned when Toby drawled " Ya got my blood runnin through your veins gurl " .. and we were treated to that insipid line not once , but TWICE ! The revelations were yawn inducing , and the dramatic confessions boiled down to " I was stupid and stubborn " . 3 . The acting was okay considering the wreck of a script they had to work with . Toby was dark and brooding most of the film , but when he smiled and lightened up he was charming . It 's a shame he didn't have more screen time like that . Kelly Preston 's acting chops are pretty rusty and it shows . Lindsay Haun is talented and it 's certainly not her fault the writers made her character so unlikeable in the beginning that you don't blame her father for not coming to look for her . Burt Reynolds and Tess Harper were able to make more of this movie but still looked more or less lost . ( And indeed , their characters get lost in this film ! ) 4 . If you 're a Toby fan you 'll love the songs . But often the movie felt like a scene was forced in just so they could feature one of his songs-or the artists on his record label . For instance , the movie 's official love song is " Crash Here Tonight " . You 'd think that would play around a tender love scene , but nope .. we hear about 45 seconds of it as he 's heading to a memorial service . It was as if they said " well , we gotta use this song somewhere " . The song " Broken " is haunting and the best thing to come out of this movie . In summary .. a promising plot never fully develops and the movie is horribly uneven as it forceably tries to be a vehicle for Toby Keith 's music and product placement for Ford Trucks . It goes from being about people rebuilding broken bridges to trying to be about the power of music but the story is told so poorly that both points get lost in this overgrown music video . I like Toby and really wanted to like " Broken Bridges " but the people he counted on to make this movie let him down and deserve one of his famous boots you know where .  
1	  Yes , it 's over the top , yes it 's a bit clichéd and yes , Constance Marie is a total babe and worthy of seeing again and again ! The jokes and gags might get old and repetitive after a while but the show 's still fun to watch . Since it 's a family show the humour is toned down and the writers have incorporated family values and ideals in between the gags . George Lopez is funny . Don't take him seriously and the show 's a winner . I 'm sure he didn't intend his character to be serious or a paragon of virtue . His outbursts and shouts of glee are hilarious .. I do have to say that the one big , dark , bitter spot is Benny . I hate the character .. so much so that anytime she 's on for more than 30 seconds I mute the TV just so I don't have to hear her . There is nothing funny about her dialogue or her jokes . As a mother she has to be the worst out there and I am just shocked and surprised that George , as the character , would stand by such a deplorable person for so long . Even so anytime I get ticked off at seeing Benny I think to myself : seeing her is a lot better than having to watch the Bill Engvall Show . Now there 's a bad sitcom ..  
1	  Starring : Jim Carrey , Morgan Freeman , Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie . I mean , what a conceptual NIGHTMARE . Jim Carrey playing God ? Nothing is sacred anymore . Well , this movie is hardly sacred , but it also is not sacrilegious , at least not to any great extent . Yes , Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while , but he is not God . Confused ? I 'll give you the low down . Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan , a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life . He lives with his beautiful girlfriend , Grace ( Anniston ) , and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other , but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground . Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman , only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter . Obviously not please , Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired . Much complaining and griping about God later , Bruce gets a page . After a while he gets tired of it calling , so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building ( heh ) . There he meets God ( Freeman ) , who is the Boss , Electrician , and Janitor of the building . I found this highly amusing . God is the Boss , the Holy Spirit is the Electrician , and Jesus Christ is the Janitor . Think about it . Boss , obvious . Electrician , the guy who keeps everything running . Janitor , the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left . BRILLIANT . Anyway , Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God , but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God , he starts to believe a bit . Wonder why . Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies . Since this is Hollywood , Bruce obviously eventually smartens up , learns his lesson , and starts using his powers for the good of the world . In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done , not Bruce 's . Since it is Jim Carrey , the movie is quite amusing , and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it . The movie is not perfect theology , but for Hollywood , it is definitely a good attempt . Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging , and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie . So , while far from perfect , definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it . Bottom Line : 3.5 out of 4 ( worth a view or two )  
0	  Yikes . This is pretty bad . The play isn't great to begin with , and the decision to transfer it to film does it no favours - especially as Peploe doesn't decide how she wants to treat the material 's theatrical origins ( we get occasional glances of an observing theatre audience etc . ) and has decided to go with a jumpy editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that you 're watching a film , whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material . Mira Sorvino 's central performance is breath-takingly poor : stage-y and plummy , it 's as if she 's playing the part via Helena Bonham-Carter 's Merchant Ivory oeuvre . Only Fiona Shaw delivers a performance of note - and it may be that her theatrical pedigree means that she is best able to handle the material - but it 's hard to watch a film for one performance alone , even if that performance is as light , truthful and entire as Shaw 's . Ben Kingsley turns in an average and disengaged turn , and Diana Rigg 's daughter , Rachel Stirling plays her supporting role as just that . Sadly , none of Bertolucci 's magic has rubbed off on his wife if this film is to be the evidence .  
0	  A really very bad movie , with a very few good moments or qualities . It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair , who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks , I 'm not sure . She jumps through a window and wakes up , and we see she is very pregnant . The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie . She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island . Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies ! On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his German-speaking virgin girlfriend ( you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff .. ) . He 's taking photographs , and she 's translating an esoteric German book about witches , I think . Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it , and a real estate agent , and a woman I thought was their daughter . Evidently she was an architect , and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple 's children . I guess they all traveled to the island together , but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them ( maybe they were filmed separately ) . The hotel seems neat , certainly from the exteriors , but it isn't used to any great effect . An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes , which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorder . People start getting killed , either in their dreams , or sucked into hell or something . Some of these gore scenes are OK , but not enough to recommend the movie . Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover , the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut . Much of the scene is showing another character 's reaction shots , since we 're not seeing anything ourselves . The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth rapes someone . He looked particularly nasty . There 's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed . I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her , they would do something original with her role , and let her leave Exorcist behind her ( except for the yearly horror conventions ) . In the weird , largely Italian , tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to , this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2 . That is , it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3 - Ghosthouse , La ( 1988 ) - it 's not ( that 's also a better movie than this one ) . La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead ( 1981 ) and Evil Dead II ( 1987 ) - again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 ( and much better than those ) . There 's also a Casa 5 , La ( 1990 ) AKA House 5 , which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House : House ( 1986 ) House II : The Second Story ( 1987 ) , The Horror Show ( 1989 ) AKA House II , and House IV ( 1992 ) . How 's The Horror Show fit in there ? It doesn't really , it claimed to be a sequel , thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less ( or more ? ) confusion . Oddly , The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House , and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2 . Does your head hurt yet ?  
1	  It sounds as if it should be a biography of Claude Monet but it 's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a French synchronized swimming team . There are no parents or teachers to speak of , no school , and boys are represented by one peripheral figure , the hunky Francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused . Pauline Aquart is the youngest of the three , only aspiring to join the team she so much admires . She 's kind of odd looking . She 's not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long , bony limbs , big feet , and no derriere to speak of . She 's prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips . After a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling . Adele Haenel is older - more , well , more developed physically . What a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit , sauntering around , teasing the boys , swishing her long blond hair . But she 's not what she seems . Or is she ? I couldn't quite figure it out . The French are long on paradoxes and short on consistency . No wonder Francois is always sniffing after her . There 's not so much ambiguity in Louse Blachere 's character . She 's on the team too but she 's dumpy and plain , and sensitive about it , and has an intense crush on Francois . Blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance . The movie deals with the relationships between these three , meaning intrigues , deceptions , hidden feelings , and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another . This is of course a tricky topic . It becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between Pauline and Adele . Not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie . The only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on , and what little sex there is under the covers , sometimes literally . I don't think I want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much , partly because it 's suggestive rather than expressed through action , partly because it 's complex , and partly because I 'm not sure I got it all . Let me give an example . Okay . Adele is the girl the others envy . She 's also quite distant and self satisfied . On top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all , from the handsome but dumb Francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from . She brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio . When Pauline approaches her about joining the swim team , Adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys . A superior and self-indulgent narcissist , you know ? But then the soi-disant slut takes the skinny Pauline under her wing and reveals to Pauline that she 's still a virgin . Really ? Yes , really . Pauline begins to draw closer to Adele and Adele finally confesses that she 'd like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like Pauline to do it for her . Pauline , now drawn sexually to Adele , performs the task with subdued relish . NOW Adele would REALLY like to get it on with a man , preferably older and experienced . So she takes Pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows Pauline to the powder room . The two girls stand there staring at one another , neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other . But Adele stands so close that Pauline slowly loosens her own reins , reaches up , and kisses Adele on the lips . Adele steps back , smiling , and says , " There now , that wasn't so bad , was it ? " , and then walks back into the club . That 's a pretty close description of whatever is going on between Pauline and Adele - but what the hell IS going on ? Initially , Adele treats Pauline like an irrelevant child , later like a close friend , finally like a potential lover - and the minute Pauline responds , Adele walks off satisfied . Is she USING Pauline the way she seems to be using men ? Does it satisfy Adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude ? I don't know . I 've slighted Louise Blachere as the third member of the trio , the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity , but I 've only skipped her for considerations of space . Should you see it ? By all means . ( Just compare it to the typical American movie about high school kids . ) For men , some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique , this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot .  
1	  This is apparently one of Shemp 's first shorts with the Stooges . ( This excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team ) . But the threesome 's comedic timing is at its honed best here . Aside from the intense slapstick scenes , there are others more subtle , but just as funny . Watch Larry when Shemp asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot . Or watch the real object prompting Moe 's exclamation , " Oh .. highly polished mahogany ! " Emil Sitka is at his bewildered goofiest . And the goon may look scary , but he 's somehow funny . He seems as frustrated and perplexed with the Stooges as are " regular " people in other shorts . For Shemp aficionados , this is a must have episode . It won't disappoint .  
0	  As there was nothing wrong with the acting etc etc the writing for the episode is way off for this series phantom or no phantom . It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the martian man hunter . You have to know that in the middle of the 6th series no matter what happens it is not true what is going on and really brings nothing to the story of the series except meeting the martian man hunter again and to waste 30 minutes to do this is by far another case of bad writing in the soap opera of smallville . I really like the show but mainly due to the cast and the 3 or so good episodes each year but who ever is on the writing cast that works or used to work on the soaps needs to be canned . This was by far one of the worst . With in the first 4 minutes you know that what is going on is bogus and anything happening is a dream based on Clark 's infliction obviously caused by a phantom zone character and when he wakes up he will win and blah blah blah so the writers don't have to really create a villain that will progress the story line any this week . May as well have added another villain to die in the last episode the martian man hunter was in and made him fly away again or come back and tell Clark he forgot his sunglasses to get a closer look like in this episode and call it a day .  
1	  I really liked this Summerslam due to the look of the arena , the curtains and just the look overall was interesting to me for some reason . Anyways , this could have been one of the best Summerslam 's ever if the WWF didn't have Lex Luger in the main event against Yokozuna , now for it 's time it was ok to have a huge fat man vs a strong man but I 'm glad times have changed . It was a terrible main event just like every match Luger is in is terrible . Other matches on the card were Razor Ramon vs Ted Dibiase , Steiner Brothers vs Heavenly Bodies , Shawn Michaels vs Curt Hening , this was the event where Shawn named his big monster of a body guard Diesel , IRS vs 1-2-3 Kid , Bret Hart first takes on Doink then takes on Jerry Lawler and stuff with the Harts and Lawler was always very interesting , then Ludvig Borga destroyed Marty Jannetty , Undertaker took on Giant Gonzalez in another terrible match , The Smoking Gunns and Tatanka took on Bam Bam Bigelow and the Headshrinkers , and Yokozuna defended the world title against Lex Luger this match was boring and it has a terrible ending . However it deserves 8/10  
0	  Five passengers at a bus depot tell each other their scary dreams while waiting to be picked up . But is there more to these nightmares than meets the eye ? Lucky me , five bad movies for the price of one ! Each segment features the very worst in acting , special effects , make up and music . And these were supposed to be scary ? Hmm .. I think I 've been more freaked out during an episode of Teletubbies . I swear , you 'll sit there like I was , bored to tears waiting in vain for something interesting to happen . Don't bother . It never does . In fact , I even stopped fast forwarding the commercials , as they were a good deal more entertaining than the main feature . AND the ending is the ultimate cop-out . Yep , none of this actually ever happened . If only the same could be said for the day I set my VCR to record this cobblers .. 2/10  
1	  I 'm a huge fan of the Dukes of Hazzard TV show . And I really enjoyed this flick . I enjoyed myself here a lot more than I did with other summer blockbusters . It 's funny hearing people rail against this movie with excuses like " lame plot " and " it 's much cruder than the show . " Does ANYONE remember the crudeness of the humor in the pilot episode ? Daisy makes incest jokes and Bo says that Luke had probably fathered half the kids in the orphanage . The only reason it was cleaned up is because it changed to and earlier time slot . And as far as the plot goes . It was the perfect Dukes plot . In fact as a remake it probably stays truer to the source material than any TV show that has migrated to the big screen . While Sean William Scott and Johnny Knoxville aren't EXACTLY like their small screen versions , they do a great job and work very well together . I wasn't too keen on Burt 's Boss Hogg though . And I would have like a little bit more incompetence from Sheriff Roscoe . In the movie Roscoe is a little .. scary . And who didn't have a smile on their face as the General Lee is racing through the streets of Atlanta and the back roads of Hazzard ? Folks , allow yourself to enjoy a movie that is just an excuse for nostalgia , bikinis and car chases , you won't be sorry . It 's just a great dumb movie !  
1	  A beautiful piece of children 's cinema buried in a world of archaic Celticism . Setting the story around the famous Book of Kels , believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of Iona , off the western coast of Scotland . Telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of Crom-Cruic , the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology . In hopes of recovering a lost artefact . The films true beauty lies in its ' animation . Cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity . Deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant Cartoon Network series ' Samurai Jack ' for its genius use of mark making and background depth , The Secret of Kels creates a consistently affective Celtic world living under the shadow of Viking invasion . The history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and Celtic-revivalist mysticism . The girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is , as she glides from branch to branch . Appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary Cheshire Cat from Alice and Wonderland . The Secret of Kels is an absolute treat . For all genders , all ages , it 's a lovely piece of family cinema . Don't expect to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed !  
1	  When I was six yo , I learned about a series called " Los Campeones " , and even if I was just a kid I did everything I need to convince my parents to let me watch " The Champions " and " the Avengers " once every week . I think that was the Golden Age of English series .. ( I already own the complete cycle of " The Prisoner " ! ) but lasted also a few years later with " The Tomorrow People " , " the Worst Witch " ( I just me , or this is " Harry Potter " in girl , of course , before As much as I want " The Campions " to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4 , I 'm also waiting for " Dr. Who " ( pack the whole series in a set of , uhm , maybe 300 DVD 's , please , I couldn't expend more for it , 8) , " People of Tomorrow " , and several other ' low budget ' , but great stories to be available within my reached zones . I speak and understand English , but not all my relatives do , including my parents , whom introduced me into these great stories .. I hope someday , someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as I originally view them .. Dubbed or subtitled , but in the same format I saw them . Remember , Zone 1 or 4 are OK with my TV set !  
1	  The way this story played out and the interaction between the 2 lead characters may lead me to believe that if the X-Files continues without Mulder and Scully , these would be a pretty good replacement duo .  
0	  How many fricken ' times do we have to see a spook walking by in the background & peaking through a mirror 's reflection ? It 's been done in two dozen movies in recent memory & four dozen times in this choppy , poorly done film . There were only two freaky moments to appreciate .. when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters . Speaking of characters , the acting was as flat as the Diet Coke in the 64 oz . cup I was drawing it from . The side characters could have been pulled from various Scooby Doo cartoons . There was the friendly , aged sheriff . There was the kooky weirdo living in the backwoods with the Alabama drawl . Lots'o'characters with no development . The most disturbing image was that of a murdered child in the beginning . But rather than explore the child 's murder , which would have been interesting , they just let us know that she was dead & her parents had a hard time reconciling her death with the community & each other . When they reach the cabin , the scenes rarely flowed together .. with flashing images of the dead daughter interjected here & there . Oh .. and the eerie sounds were also overdone . You know what I mean .. creaking doors that open by themselves , crickets in the forest , yada yada yada . Ooohh . Haven't seen that before . Again , you 'll see the amazing self-opening door in the movie over and over an over again . NOTE TO DIRECTOR : a scary scene is only scary if it 's not repeated every 5 minutes in the same film . Think these things out before calling out " it 's a wrap ! "  
0	  I usually read reviews before I watch a movie . Guess what , I didn't do that before watching TLB , and I have to say I was very surprised to see the above average rating at IMDb . I found it to have a total lack of story . You just get dropped into it ( and , sadly , not in the way Saving Private Ryan dropped us into the movie ) , and it also has a sudden end , which was very unsatisfying for me . I have to admit , the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me , especially with the low budget in mind . But prepare yourself to have a laugh .. Some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are Olympic gymnasts . A mid-air corkscrew or somersault during WW I is a bit too much for me , especially when it 's performed countless times during the movie .. But the parts that really got me laughing until I almost cried were the scenes containing close combat . The screaming and shouting German voices .. unbelievably funny . It seems as if they are spoken by one single actor / voice performer , because they all sound exactly the same , and it just sounds like a ' typical ' German voice . I would absolutely NOT recommend this movie to anyone , except to people who just want to have some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it .  
0	  The plot of ' Edison ' was decent , but one actor in particular ruined the entire film . Justin Timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie . He is by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen , and should face the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. squad . Whether it was an emotional scene , an action scene , or even a silent scene , Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it . Do not waste your time watching this film . Don't even bother downloading it , midget porn would be a much better choice . And Justin , if you 're reading this , stick to music . Even though you 're no good at that , you 've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually sing .  
1	  Uneven Bollywood drama . Karisma Kapoor is excellent as an Indian woman in Canada who marries a friend ( Sanjay Kapoor ) , has a child , and then visits his family in India only to find they are terrorist warlords . Drama and tragedy ensue , and the film becomes a kind of NOT WITHOUT MY BABY styled thriller . Film is compelling , its few song / dance numbers are uninteresting and needless , the gaity of Bollywood song and dance is really out of character for the intensity of this film 's drama , at least once we 've left the comforting confines of their Canadian love nest  although one number involving a cameo by the stunning Aishwarya Rai is enjoyably provocative , if ultimately misplaced as well . Likewise , the inclusion of Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan as a happy-go-lucky drifter who helps Kapoor in her escape from the clutches of the warlord turns what had been a very serious drama into a silly farce , and it only gets back on his feet when his character  and his fantasies about Rai that generate her cameo dance  are dispensed with . His throw-away comic-book dialog and the silliness of his fight scenes detract from the film 's primary gripping drama . The cast is nicely supported by Nana Patekar as the warlord , and the elegant Deepti Naval who is outstanding as his long-suffering wife who finally choses to stand up against him in one of the film 's best scenes ; Ritu Shivpuri and Rajshree Solanki are also very good as Sanjay 's sisters in India , and very pleasing eye candy . But Sanjay himself overacts terribly , especially during obvious ad-libs . The directorial style of writer / director Krishna Wamsi is sloppy , rampant with rough transitions and abrupt cuts , although his camera movement is good . The musical underscore is also quite effective , moody , featuring wordless female voice over a small orchestral ensemble ( too bad little if any of that made it onto SHAKTI 's soundtrack cd , but Bollywood hasn't yet discovered the value of including score along with songs on their soundtrack albums , at least not in most cases ) . But SHAKTI is Karisma Kapoor 's film , all the way , though , and the intensity of her performance once the film switches to India contrasts nicely with the gentle romance with which she engaged with Sanjay in the initial Canadian scenes . Despite the unevenness of much of the picture , Karisma 's performance completely sells the film and solidifies its otherwise inconsistent measures . In a strange way , also , I found the story to be another take on the ostentation of royalty I 'd noticed in CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER and MARIE ANTOINETTE , both of which I 'd seen just prior , although SHAKTI of course is an entirely different kind of film ; but the focus on a dysfunctional royal family  here living in the austerity of terrorism-controlled poverty in India rather than the elegance of Versailles or the massive megalomania of feudal China 's Tang Dynasty  whose self-serving seeking of power brings ruin upon many others and forces an uprising of one kind or another provides the film with a notable subtext .  
0	  .. but this just isn't working and I am surprised to see how many people consider it good . On what grounds ? There are some loose hints here and there , but the whole material is self-indulgent and unconvincing . Lynch 's movies are generally intriguing because they generate a sense of confusion and yet , are very playful when doing that . There is some visual sense , there are some subplots , characters , ideas etc . But this is dull and yes , pointless . Because whatever there is to explore is either to " small " , either too far-fetched , or simply told before in a superior manner . It 's just Lynch exploring DV , nothing more so it should be treated like this . 1/10  
1	  If only ALL animation was this great . This film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects : Story and Character . The characters in this film are beautifully personified . I felt for all of the characters , and human-animal relationship in the movie works perfectly . The beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation hasn't worked better in any other film . This is a great movie for kids , and for adults who want a classic hero 's journey . 8 of 10 .  
0	  This early role for Barbara Shelley ( in fact , her first in Britain after working in Italy ) , was made when she was 24 years old , and it 's certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in 1957 's " Cat Girl . " While blondes and brunettes get most of the attention ( I 'll always cherish Yutte Stensgaard ) , the lovely auburn-haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability ( one such example being 1960 's " Village of the Damned , " in which her screen time was much less than her character 's husband , George Sanders ) . She is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of " Cat People , " and is seen to great advantage throughout ( it 's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase ) . Her character apparently sleeps in the nude , and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened ( also exposed 8 years later in 1965 's " Rasputin-The Mad Monk " ) . The ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder ( I don't see what held that dress up , but I 'd sure like to ) . All in all , proof positive that Barbara Shelley , in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses , rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable , a real test of star power , which she would find soon enough at Hammer 's studios in Bray , for the duration of the 1960 's .  
1	  Astaire and Rogers at the height of their popularity . In 1936 Americans thought of the Navy as a place for song and dance . WWII was still a few years away . Fred and Ginger dance up the town . The plot is decent , but who cares .. By the way , notice the cameo roles for Betty Grable and a glamorous Lucile Ball . A load of Irving Berlin songs , including the famous " Let 's Face the Music and Dance " . In that scene , Ginger 's heavy swooping dress smacks Fred in the face during one of her spins and almost knocks him unconscious . Fred insisted on keeping the take as the dancing was superb nonetheless . Ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than Fred , since she had to do all the same moves , in step , and backwards .. Come to think of it , Fred 's voice was nice too . The man was effortless in motion . Here 's a movie to cozy up on the couch with a loved-one , kick off the shoes , and enjoy the entertainment .  
0	  This series just gets worse and worse . Poorly written and just plain not funny ! The premise is excellent , but the writer 's inexperience shines through . By trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone . Now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about , and resorted to that patronizing , smug , " Oh , silly you " style acting that comes with a no laugh script . They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say , aren't we zany ? Isn't this funny ? Well , no , it 's not actually . Gum disease is less painful . No wonder , with the exception of Corner Gas , Canadians generally avoid Canadian TV . Come on CBC you 're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of Canadian talent . Pull the plug on this amateurish mess .  
0	  I had high hopes for this film , because I thought CLEAN , SHAVEN ( Kerrigan 's first feature ) was absolutely terrific , the most assuredly cinematic low budget film I 'd ever seen . But much of CLAIRE DOLAN is utterly pointless and flat . Scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix , without much thought for narrative or character . Is Claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not ? Hard to tell . Why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life ? Why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in Seattle ? Why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color ? Why does Claire accept some johns and not others ? The filmmaker doesn't seem to know . It feels as if everything is improvised ( though I understand this wasn't the case ) and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary . After the screening I saw , Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative . It sounded like learned rhetoric . I think it was a cop-out . I am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as CLEAN , SHAVEN would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old " political " cliches .  
1	  I stumbled across this ( Act-I ) by pure dumb luck and this was more than a decade ago . This was'nt even what the cover label on the tape mentioned . It amazed me . It intimidated me . It shocked me . I eventually forgot about and almost a decade later , I happened to think about it again . Then went and bought both acts . They were even better than I had experienced at first . My only complaint is that while the Tank Police keep on going on and on about being at war with crime , warranting tanks and heavy artillery , it would seem as though they are really having a hard time with criminals . That is either never shown or is simply a lie as they appear to be taking it easy most of the time . If that bit about being in a state of war was really propaganda , it certainly has not been shown as such . I don't think the original Japanese version could have been any where as good as the Americanized version of this . But regarding the story , there has certainly been some proper explanations lost in translation but it can be excused .  
1	  These guys are anything but the Usual Suspects ! They are a total bunch of likeable oddballs who you want to see get away with it , but they are so hapless that there is very little chance of that . No one is better than William H Macy at portraying the man with a big heart but down on his luck . This is probably his best performance since Fargo . Sam Rockwell played the meathead boxer to perfection , and the rest of the gang were uniformly good also . Luis Guzman brought some great comic relief as Cosimo , and George Clooney stole every scene in his cameo role . The heist scene at the end was absolutely hilarious . The direction was also spot on by the Russo brothers . There was certainly a Coen brothers feel to the film throughout and it will be interesting to see how they will develop their careers . They have a long way to go to match the Coen 's but this is an excellent start and I look forward to their next celluloid outing . .. " Yo mutha 's a whore " !  
1	  This movie was made in 1948 , but it still rings true today . Very , very funny . It begins with a family wanting to buy a little place in the country and it " builds " from there . Anyone who has ever built a house , will find this movie very endearing . Great cast . Cary Grant and Myrna Lloyd are delightful in this film . This is a classic black and white film that reflects the grand style of the 40 's .. clothing , architecture and family life . Many references are made to the cost of things , and those comparisons to today 's costs are pretty amazing . I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this movie completely . I am surprised of the number of middle aged people who have never heard of it . A true classic .  
1	  Robert De Niro , Cuba Gooding Jr. , Hal Holbrook , and all the rest of the actors and actresses in " Men of Honour " have combined to make this a fine movie . Mark Isham wrote the filmscore , so you know the music is truly fine , too . But : After noticing a slew of goofs , loopholes , and over-dramatic heart-string pluckings right from the start , I had to make a vow to ignore them and sit back to enjoy the film . If you can do that , it _ really_is _ good . The story of Carl Brashear , a true-to-life hero , is inspirational enough to last a lifetime . Look him up on the internet .. The entire story is more amazing than the film , as the Director admitted in his comments . There were only three African-American U.S. Navy divers in World War II . However , none reached the status of U.S. Navy Master Diver . Carl Brashear was THE first African-American U.S. Navy Master Diver . AND he was the first amputee diver to ever be certified or recertified as a U.S. Navy diver . ( Resounding Applause ) . On the negative side of the movie 's ledger : Should I tell you of only one of the many " loopholes " ? Yeah , I 'll mark this comment as containing " spoilers " and do so .. The early , pivotal scene where the helicopter hits the radio mast and sinks into the sea : They 'd never have had the time to suit up a full Mark V diver , even if he were the legendary Master Chief Billy Sunday , in time to be only " .. a couple of minutes late " saving the pilot . So , for loopholes , goofs , and over-dramatization , I derated " Men of Honor " from a perfect 10 down to a 7 . Will Hollywood EVER realize that the unalloyed truth is so much better that their over-dramatic approach to story-telling ? I doubt it . Too bad !  
0	  Well , what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation ? There are some amazing actors in this ( Oliver Reed , Sarah Miles , Christopher Plummer ) but they clearly are clocking up the money . Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant ( who looks suitably embarrassed ) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter . If you really want to see a " watchable " adaptation of Cartland , the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for ( " A Hazard of Hearts " - what a title ! ) . Gilbert is the weak link in that , but Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act , and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek ( Edward Fox & Diana Rigg )  
1	  Gus Van Sant has made some excellent films . I truly am a fan . However , I can't help but feel that the cerebral edge of Tom Robbins book " Even Cowgirls Get the Blues " is lost in translation to the big screen . Alone , Tom Robbins and Gus Van Sant are incredible visionaries and towers of talent . Ultimately though this one just didn't work . It wasn't that the characters weren't well developed or the plot and content didn't come alive . It 's just that our imaginations are much more powerful when reading a book like this . We 're taken away to a different time and place and we sometimes think the worst and / or the best and it adds to the overall roller-coaster of the book as it neatly unfolds according to the author 's precision . Movies however can leave one with less of the imagination and emotion roller-coaster detracting from the overall experience . This is what I believe happened here . I suggest reading the book !  
0	  From the start this film was awful ! Why was it that bad ? If it isn't the naked women , not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of Colgate whitening ! Then it 's the ' crazy ' old guy at the gas station , who isn't so much crazy , but more " I 'm not sure how to act a great deal so I will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as I can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods " ! Then back to these naked nymphs in need of a cure for gingivitis .. apparently , without touching you .. and this is according to the opening scene .. they can cause a nasty looking red rash on your neck , which I assumed to be a chunk of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some TCP to clear it right up . Then you have Sophie Holland who plays Ally , I have never seen such baad acting , she is more of a " me me me , if I 'm not having fun no-one else is , and I don't wanna do this so I won't , and I 'm the meanest cow on the planet , I 'm sarcastic , petty and if I don't get things my way I will sulk ! " , kind of person .. reminds me more of a 6 yr old girl 's attitude . I don't think it 's even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of Blair Witch , or how low-budget the film actually was that when Judd was hacking at the ' locked ' door it was in fact open before he reached to unlock it from the other side ! This film is completely laughable ! If it were a spoof then it would have been successful .. only just though , but , as a horror film is was just plain wrong ! I can't even being to describe everything that went t ! ts up in this movie I would run out of room ! Although it was funny to watch Andrew drip raspberry juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while Tom Savini 's character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision ! It was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn tractor , which as we all know is thee number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow ! So is it any wonder they don't get away with it ? And how many people do you know that can slice open their wrist and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened ! No pain , no weakening from blood loss , nothing ! ? But the silliest part is when all of a sudden ( and i mean that literally ) it 's one YEAR later and Molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the nymphs , and then lo and behold , Shaun Hutson picks her up .. of course not without a line to promote his books ! ( altho admittedly he is one of my fav authors ) but suddenly , and with absolutely no hint of an xplanation as to how and why .. she 's evil herself and lures Hutson to his death , then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a petrol can , even after his ' dazzling ' performance on why no-one should ever venture there for whatever reason .. cue the nymphs stupidly slappin each other around a bit for fun while Crazy pours petrol everywhere .. and here endeth the film .. finally ! My conclusion .. if you hadn't already guessed by now .. absolute rubbish ! There was no proper thought went into it at all , whoever was aiming the camera needed firing .. and come to think of it so did 99 % of the cast ! If the right director , actors , and budget got behind this it could have been decent . But , once again , low-budget English horror films but the rest of the genre , the country , and the English film-making industry to shame ! ( And I 'm English so I 'm allowed to say that ) ! In fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first 15-20 mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area . All I kept thinking throughout this was " Jesus Christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this , its absolute cow 's testicles ! " But I can't turn a film off after I 've started watching it unfortunately . I had to watch From Dusk Til Dawn afterwards just to remind myself that Tom Savini does have it in him to act well ! If there was an option for 0/10 then believe me I woulda chose that , cuz this film isn't even worth the one point I did give it ! But this is just my opinion , watch it and decide for yourself .  
1	  Marvelous film again dealing with the trials and tribulations of World War 11 England . What makes this film so good is the touching of the human element . This film is definitely in the tradition of such British line classics such as " Mrs. Miniver " and " Hope and Glory . " As is the case with this film , we see the desperation of people in the time of war . The performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered John Thaw , who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the London bombing . We soon see why this child wets his bed . He comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly . The old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life . When the child is returned to his mother , the old man goes to London and seeks him out only to find tragedy . He literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boy 's home . The picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships .  
0	  When I first saw a glimpse of this movie , I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball . Rachel York 's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful . Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent . To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous . I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy , the producers decided to get Rachel York . She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough . It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball , but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent . If you noticed York 's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin , nothing is similar in any way-her expression , voice , or movement . To top it all off , Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible . Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky . He 's small and skinny , his accent is unreal , and once again , his acting is unbelievable . Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either , they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky . Overall , extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told . If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball , I suggest watching A & E Biography of Lucy and Desi , read the book from Lucille Ball herself , or PBS ' American Masters : Finding Lucy . If you want to see a docudrama , " Before the Laughter " would be a better choice . The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in " Before the Laughter " is much better compared to this . At least , a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing .  
1	  Blood Castle ( aka Scream of the Demon Lover , Altar of Blood , Ivanna-the best , but least exploitation cinema-sounding title , and so on ) is a very traditional Gothic Romance film . That means that it has big , creepy castles , a headstrong young woman , a mysterious older man , hints of horror and the supernatural , and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term . It also means that it is very deliberately paced , and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement . If you love films like Robert Wise 's The Haunting ( 1963 ) , but you also have a taste for late 1960s / early 1970s Spanish and Italian horror , you may love Blood Castle , as well . Baron Janos Dalmar ( Carlos Quiney ) lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional , unspecified European village . The locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he beds a woman , she soon after ends up dead-the consensus is that he sets his ferocious dogs on them . This is quite a problem because the Baron has a very healthy appetite for women . At the beginning of the film , yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilated . Meanwhile , Dr. Ivanna Rakowsky ( Erna Schürer ) has appeared in the center of the village , asking to be taken to Baron Dalmar 's castle . She 's an out-of-towner who has been hired by the Baron for her expertise in chemistry . Of course , no one wants to go near the castle . Finally , Ivanna finds a shady individual ( who becomes even shadier ) to take her . Once there , an odd woman who lives in the castle , Olga ( Cristiana Galloni ) , rejects Ivanna and says that she shouldn't be there since she 's a woman . Baron Dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay . She ends up staying , but somewhat reluctantly . The Baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns , which the Baron 's brother , Igor , is suffering from . Unfortunately , the Baron 's brother appears to be just a lump of decomposing flesh in a vat of bizarre , blackish liquid . And furthermore , Ivanna is having bizarre , hallucinatory dreams . Just what is going on at the castle ? Is the Baron responsible for the crimes ? Is he insane ? I wanted to like Blood Castle more than I did . As I mentioned , the film is very deliberate in its pacing , and most of it is very understated . I can go either way on material like that . I don't care for The Haunting ( yes , I 'm in a very small minority there ) , but I 'm a big fan of 1960s and 1970s European horror . One of my favorite directors is Mario Bava . I also love Dario Argento 's work from that period . But occasionally , Blood Castle moved a bit too slow for me at times . There are large chunks that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking alternated with scenes of Ivanna slowly walking the corridors of the castle . But the atmosphere of the film is decent . Director José Luis Merino managed more than passable sets and locations , and they 're shot fairly well by Emanuele Di Cola . However , Blood Castle feels relatively low budget , and this is a Roger Corman-produced film , after all ( which usually means a low-budget , though often surprisingly high quality " quickie " ) . So while there is a hint of the lushness of Bava 's colors and complex set decoration , everything is much more minimalist . Of course , it doesn't help that the Retromedia print I watched looks like a 30-year old photograph that 's been left out in the sun too long . It appears " washed out " , with compromised contrast . Still , Merino and Di Cola occasionally set up fantastic visuals . For example , a scene of Ivanna walking in a darkened hallway that 's shot from an exaggerated angle , and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only . There are also a couple Ingmar Bergmanesque shots , where actors are exquisitely blocked to imply complex relationships , besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the frame . The performances are fairly good , and the women-especially Schürer-are very attractive . Merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity . Schürer went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres , with English titles such as Sex Life in a Woman 's Prison ( 1974 ) , Naked and Lustful ( 1974 ) , Strip Nude for Your Killer ( 1975 ) and Erotic Exploits of a Sexy Seducer ( 1977 ) . Blood Castle is much tamer , but in addition to the nudity , there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage , and of course the scenes mixing sex and death . The primary attraction here , though , is probably the story , which is much a slow-burning romance as anything else . The horror elements , the mystery elements , and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are bonuses , but in the end , Blood Castle is a love story , about a couple overcoming various difficulties and antagonisms ( often with physical threats or harms ) to be together .  
1	  This movie is probably my favorite movie of all time . Miriam Flynn is excellent as Bunny Packard . Zane Buzby as Delores is comic genius . The rest of the cast is amazing , and the film is really really funny . A definite satire of horror films , with a zany twist . If you enjoy a fun , comedy filled evening , then go and rent this classic . You 'll laugh all the way through !  
0	  My first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us Blair Witch Project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage . The acting was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of Oklahoma and the plot , such as there was , is predictable , boring and inane . 85 % of the script is four letter words and innumerable variations on them . Mother F seems to be the " writer 's " favorite because it is used constantly . It must have taken all of 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at last call . Thank God I rented it and could jump through most of it on fast forward . Don't waste your time or money with this .  
0	  This insipid mini operetta featuring a Eddy-McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes . It 's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers . In under a minute he is packed off to Morrocco where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow ; the leader of an Arab tribe that would rather sing than fight . Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare possess fine light opera voices ( with little acting ability ) and there 's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along . This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers . With more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation .

1	  Out of the first five episodes of Hammer 's short-running " Hammer House of Horror " series , this fifth episode with the wonderful title " The House that Bled to Death " is arguably the creepiest one . As a great fan of the Hammer Studios ' Gothic Horror films for many years , I wonder what took me so long to finally start watching the series quite recently . So far , I 've only seen the first five episodes , and I have a strong feeling that the best is yet to come , but even if the series stays as entertaining as the first five episodes are , I will be satisfied . Whereas the second and third episodes were great to watch for their morbid and ingeniously dark sense of humor , this fifth entry is definitely the one out of the first five that delivers the most genuine Horror . The episode begins when an elderly man murders his wife out of unknown motivations . Years later , William ( Nicholas Ball ) and Emma Peters ( Rachel Davies ) move in the house with their little daughter Sophie ( Emma Ridley ) . Soon after moving in , however , the family have to find out that there is something terribly wrong with the house , which is seemingly haunted .. The second episode directed by Francis Megahy is a lot better than his mediocre previous entry , " Growing Pains " ( Episode 4 ) , and the fairly unknown actors deliver good performances . The film is also well-made in terms of effects , cinematography and score . " The House that Bled to Death " is a solid episode that delivers the elements that my fellow Hammer-fans should like to see in a Short Horror tale . The film delivers a creepy atmosphere , genuine scare moments and intelligent twists , and is suspenseful and highly entertaining from the beginning to the end . Overall , this is highly recommendable to Hammer fans .  
0	  I was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in November ! It looked awesome and the songs ! I was quite disappointed when I went to watch it ! This is a film which weaves 6 couples together . It has a multi cast of 12 people ! A huge amount of stars have worked on this film . I think the director , Nikhil Advani , has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him . Compared to Nikhil 's directorial Debut ' Kal Ho Naa Ho ' , ' Salaam-e-Ishq ' falls quite behind . I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast . I think the best factors of this film is the songs ! The songs are excellent and I think that all of the songs are awesome , Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years . I think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs ! One thing I was disappointed with , is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar . I found this extremely rude watching this with family ! Although , some may find this nude as comedy , it is not something you would want to watch with parents ! I think the best acting was performed by Salman and Priyanka Overall , I think its an alright movie !  
0	  As the summary says you just made the most ignorant comment i have ever heard on an RPG . You seriously thought they were gay ? Are you retarded ? If you went to go save your best friend and someone decides out of the goodness of his heart to help you then you are in a serious debt to that man . Lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other it made them closer as friends . They weren't gay lovers like your bitching about . And to let you know the game is set in a medieval time period . Back then , women did just prepare meals while the men fought . Do you even know your history ? Do you know how long it took for women to be accepted in the army in present day ? This game contains a lot of realism even though your too damn slow obviously to catch it , and you really need to spit out some solid proof instead of ignorant assumptions based off your misguided act to interpret the story .  
1	  I recently saw I.Q. and even though I 'm not a romantic comedy type of gal , I think that it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch . So many movies in my opinion lack honesty . You know that feeling when you 're watching a movie and you just feel robbed because it 's taking something from the story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was trash ? The story between the scientists is a sweet and funny one . How they stuck together and they tried to help Tim Robbins character become smart . I liked the love story between Tim and Meg because it was simple and brought up a good point when it comes to love , " nothing is what it seems " . I would recommend this for a Sunday morning . 7/10  
1	  This film , in my opinion , is , despite it 's flaws ( which I maintain are * few *) , an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art . What Mr. Bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films . He does not receive 1/100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience . If it were not for Mr. Bakshi , I don't believe animation would have survived the Disney onslaught . What is more , with The Lord of the Rings , he has not only created a beautiful animated film , but he has created an entirely new art form - unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground . Most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film ( the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation ) . But I feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm . No , this is not Disney animation . No it 's not live action . No , it 's not " cheating " - what it is is a new , fascinating , and absolutely wonderful art form . Something so fresh , and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as " The Lord of the Rings " . Bakshi 's pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of Middle Earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way , in particular , the darker of Tolkien 's creatures , particularly the Nazgul , are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish . Peter S. Beagle 's screenplay ( based very little , as I understand it , on an early draft by Chris Conkling ) is a very loyal adaptation of Tolkien 's works . Where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which Bakshi has created . There are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3/4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film , but there are very few changes to the storyline . There are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled : The reforging of Narsil , the gifts of Galadriel , the Huorns at the battle of the Hornburg , but , again , with the time limitations he had ( already the longest animated feature in history ) , these are certainly understandable ( though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel ) . Also there is the delightful ( one of my favorites ) score by Leonard Rosenman ( who also scored Barry Lyndon and Star Trek IV ( the score for which is clearly based on his LotR work ) ) . It is bombastic and audacious and , dare I say , perfect . It stands on it 's own as an orchestral triumph , but when coupled with the images of the film , it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection . So far from the typical Hollywoodland fare that it turns many people off . The voice actors are wonderful . Of particular note is John Hurt as Aragorn who just oozes the essence of Strider . The character design is also wonderfully unique , though not often to everyone 's taste . But remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he / she imagines , not what you might have imagined , and so Aragorn is realized with a distinctive Native American feel and Boromir appears in Viking inspired garb . This is perhaps not what you imagined , but I can only applaud Mr. Bakshi for showing us what he " saw " . It also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with Priscilla Tolkien in developing the character outfits for the film . One farther word - the Flight to the Ford sequence , in my opinion , is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid . Bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment , and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build . Bakshi 's artistic ability and Tolkien 's incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaled . The recent DVD release ( 2001 ) by Warner Brothers , is sorely lacking . While we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format , the package is woefully short of extras . How glorious it would have been to have had a director 's commentary , been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release . Another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over . Also present in the DVD release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film . This version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score . Of course , the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made . We will never be able to see Bakshi 's interpretation of Gondor , of Shelob , of Faramir , of the Cracks of Doom , of Eowyn 's battle with the Witch King or Gandalf 's confrontation with him . We will never be graced with Bakshi 's image of Denethor or the Palatir or the Paths of the Dead . It is a shame beyond all shames that we will , in the end , have to accept Peter Jackson 's glitz and glitter Hollywood , action film version of these later events in Tolkien 's masterpiece , but , I suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all .

1	  Growing up in a multi racial neighborhood back in the 20 's and 30 's , I grew up very close to most of the Italian families living there . This move brought back so many pleasant memories . this is a movie most people would like who enjoy seeing more true to life movies .  
0	  In the first 20 minutes , every cliche possible was trotted out by the hack writer and director . There was the NTSB primary investigator with the tortured family life ; the politically-tortured NTSB board member played by [ I can kill ANY TV ] Ted McGinley ; the tortured father of a crash victim ; and the torturing sleazy ambulance-chasing lawyer . Hollywood still has no concept of the fragility of aircraft . The crashed plane was a 737 and it was mostly sitting on the ground like a hippo who decided to take a nap . The first third of the fuselage was intact , the rear half of the plane was intact and the debris field showed no wings or engines . Most of the people should have walked away in light of how many people survived that plane that got shredded in Iowa after it lost its hydraulics . Most of this TV plane wasn't even burned . It reminded me of the scene in " Air Force One " where the 747 hits the water and then skips along like it 's made of inch-thick steel . The show was so bad it was impossible to watch . Even my wife , who is more accepting than I , was commenting on technical flaws . What had me stunned was how this POS could ever get made . Are the producers of these things so used to clichés that they can't even recognize them ? Somebody read this script and said : Yes , I want to spend a million bucks making this real . I wish I was the guy 's next appointment . I have title to a wonderful bridge in New York that I 'd sell cheap .  
1	  I am one of Jehovah 's Witnesses and I also work in an acute care medical facility . Over the years I have seen people die from hemolytic reactions to blood transfusions , have attended numerous conferences on blood born pathogens , and have seen several patients become seriously ill from pathogens induced by transfused blood . I have also heard several Jehovah 's Witnesses being told that they will die if they refuse blood and after 26 years in the field I have never actually seen it happen , leaving the question , " is it really unreasonable to refuse blood transfusions or is the community at large benefiting from the battle on this issue ? " The issue for Jehovah 's Witnesses is a moral one . " You must abstain from blood " is not an ambiguous statement . Thank you for this movie and allowing comments on it .  
1	  This movie is of almost generation-defining importance to some of us born in the early post-war years in that ( and especially if you were born between 1946 and 1953 and loved spending Saturday afternoons at your neighborhood movie house ) you almost certainly saw it . And the memory of seeing it has probably stayed with you . It 's style is the stuff of a brief and somehow gloriously exciting moment in our growing up days . It had a modern , space-age storyboard for the audiences of it 's time . The set was any town with a supermarket and a movie theater that would be packed for a Friday midnight show . It has hot rods and rebellious youth , but in the ' why can't they let us have fun ' way rather than the disturbed , histrionic rebel without a cause way . All characters were identifiable to us - teens , parents , the old man , the doctor , the nurse , the mechanic , the boy , the puppy , even the cops - were sympathetic to us . We could relate to them all It had a singularly horrifying monster . It 's first victim is heard moaning ' it hurts .. it hurts ' and we were convinced and frightened . The menace grows continually throughout the story . There are intense periods of suspense , colourful effects , a fabulous lead in McQueen , and moments of humour , both intended and not . It even had an almost over-the-top sad part to make the more sensitive of us feel like crying . I saw it in summer , age 9 or so , double billed with ' I Married A Monster From Outer Space ' , and was so thrilled by the experience of this particular double feature that I went back a couple more times before it left . Everyone I knew saw it . Everyone I knew loved it .  
0	  So , Steve Irwin . You have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs , snakes , lizards , tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles , and mud , not only daily , but with enthusiasm . He was never able to make ME want to do it , but he managed to make his wife come close . This movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category - the films for people who just had their teeth drilled , have a migraine , or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity ( currently well populated by Disney films ) . It 's too noisy . Well , Steve is too noisy . He 's just so happy all the time , and would cut right through the blasé ' teenager ( I can hear it now : " that movie was so STUPID " ) or the Tylenol with codeine . I 'd say his enthusiasm is catching , but if it was , I would own a room full of snakes , and that hasn't happened yet . I agreed they 're beauties , but I 'm still not going to pet them . Plot was indeed predictable . Bad guys were so bad , for a minute there I thought I was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore . But the movie was filled with animals , and Steve and Terri , which is why I watched it . That plot ( if you could call it that ) was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck . My expectations were low and stayed that way . I was hoping , though , that there would be a bit of a sequel , where Steve and Terri ( having worked on their acting skills ) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur . I still can't believe we won't see Steve anymore . I hope that Terri and the children continue to be involved in the Australia Zoo and the discovery channel , at least . I can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the Irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is . Crikey !  
0	  It seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays . It 's like all you need is a camera , a group of people to be your cast and crew , a script , and a little money and walla you have a movie . Problem is that talent isn't always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds . The video store shelves are filled with these so called films . These aren't even guilty pleasures , they 're just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten . Troma Entertainment is known for making trash cinema , but most of their films are b movie gold . However , some of the films they 've put out they had nothing to do with making and some , like ' Nightmare Weekend , ' didn't deserve any form of release at all . Pros : The cast members do the best they can with the lousy material . Some unintentional hilarity . Moves at a good pace ( Should at 81 minutes ) . Cons : Awful writing , which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes . Poorly lit , especially the night scenes and the ending , which you can't make out at all . Doesn't make a lick of sense . Badly scored . Cheap and very dated effects . Total lack of character development and you won't care about anybody . This is supposed to be a horror film , but it 's lacking in that area and isn't the least bit scary . Nothing interesting or exciting happens . Loaded with unnecessary padding . Final thoughts : I never expected this to be some forgotten gem , but I never imagined it would be this bad . I don't know if it 's the worst film ever made , but it 's a definite contender . Troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release . Don't make the same mistake I did and let your curiosity get the best of you . My rating : 1/5  
0	  Well , I have to say , this movie was so bad that I would have walked out if i didn't have to review it for work . ANd the worst part is , I wanted to see it so badly that I drove all over the city , paid $ 10 parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong . Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does - the only time I 've seen him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta . Anyways , the plot has potential - it sounded great in the preview , but it is filled with totally ridiculous , predictable , weak plot turn points . And I was hoping that this would be one Christmas movie where Christmas DIDN " t have to be saved , and that Santa didn't need a replacdmetn , but nope . The only cool part was the sleigh rides , and the little bladck kid was the best character . I 'm sure this movie would be great for young kids , but for adults it 's so lame that it 's chore to sit through .  
1	  Went to Wal-Mart and found this film on DVD and had no idea whether I made a bad purchase or a good one . It is the later outcome to my viewing the entire film from beginning to end . Michelle Rodriquez , ( Diana Guzman ) , " BloodRayne " , ' 05 , gave a great performance and her looks are beautiful , sexy , and at the same time a real study in the art of how acting is really performed . Diana did not like her home life and especially her own father for the abuse he gave her mother . She decides to get boxing training in a local Brooklyn Gym and is not really well accepted by the male boxers . In her high school there is plenty of friction between her female classmates and guys . There is lots of action in the ladies bathroom and references as to private parts of guys . If you like boxing , and seeing a hot sexy gal do wonders in the ring and knock the boys on their you Know What , this is the film for you .  
0	  This movie was terrible . The first half hour is much like a .. well , apologies for the lack of articulation , but it was simply a bad version of A Clockwork Orange . The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in Clockwork ! Supposedly it was a tribute , as per the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the protagonist 's wall , however " ripoff " is the more appropriate word . The movie felt as though it was torn right from the Kubrick classic , only filmed through a new director 's eyes . A blind director . Unfortunately when it stops its massacre of Kubrick 's work , the film gets even worse . As another commentator said , the deepness of this film is just shoved down your throat . Arrogant , self absorbed and ultimately meaningless drivel . Perhaps the protagonists ramblings would touch a nerve if there was any actual character development in this movie . I felt absolutely nothing for this guy . And I 'm an alcoholic , so I figure that if anyone might be able to feel anything for him , it would be me . Awful character development , dialogue and plot . The worst part about this movie is the title . For a film called " 16 Years of Alcohol " , the alcoholism is hardly a factor in the flick . See first paragraph - it was such a butchering of A Clockwork Orange I can't get over it . A more suited title would have been " 16 Years of Violence , " or , even better , " A Clockwork Banana " . Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie . If you disregard my advice and take it out anyway , drink . Trust me .  
1	  After seeing several movies of Villaronga , I had a pretty clear opinion about him - he concentrates too much on the personal aspect of the characters , forgetting about a rhythm of the movie . That is why , though having good critics , his movies never caught the broad audience attention . In ARo he follows the same line , but really improved on the rhythm , especially in the end of the movie . Frankly speaking , I slept through the first part , cause though the first part gives necessary information , it is really slow . Nevertheless the second part is absolutely marvelous and makes the whole movie the best movie ever made by Villaronga . Recommended .  
0	  Despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes . Where were the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants ? Not on the payroll apparently . A Japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes . In a later conversation she said , " Imagine a Finnish director making a movie in Fnnish about the American Civil War using blond Swedish actors as union Army and Frenchmen as the Confederates . Worse imagine dressing the Scarlet O'Hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950 's hairdo . Maybe some people in Finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was " missing the hoop " or recognize the bizarre Jane Mansfield hair , but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears .. and be laughing in the aisles .. excellent story and photography be damned . So .. watching Memoirs of a Geisha was painful for anyone familiar with Japanese cultural nuances , actual geisha or Japanese dress , and that was the topic of the movie ! Hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making . They frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong . I thought " The Last Samurai " was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on Japan could be . Memoirs of a Geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time .  
0	  I am , as many are , a fan of Tony Scott films . When this movie came out I had high hopes that it would be like ' Man On Fire ' . To find out that the movie it 's the furthest thing from it ! The story was treading water from the get go , and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such such a good idea . And the whole ' arm'scene was too gratuitous ! The movie is centered around Kiera Kinghtly , and this movie reveals that she 'll never become a movie star ! The movie brought some of the worst acting ever . I like Tony Scott 's direction ' n all , but this takes the whole friggin cake ! Sorry Ton , 1 out of 10 !  
1	  I think the context of the story has been covered by other posters so I would just like to write about the impact this film had on me . I first saw this film the year of it 's release around 1987 . My school organised a trip to the cinema to see it , for an RE project I think . We all went along of course excited because we were on a school trip to the cinema ! Little did we know what we were about to experience . To this day I still remember the feelings it invoked in me and i remembered crying a lot as were most of my friends . I think at the age we were we found it shocking and quiet rightly outraged in our own youthful way . It had such an impact on me that I joined the Anti Apartheid Movement the same year . I think it served it 's purpose in my case .  
1	  WOW . One of the greatest movies I have EVER - EVER seen . Absolutely LOVED it ! Before the opening credits were done I was glued to the screen . It 's a Sci-Fi thriller - AND edge of your seat Whodunnit . Incredible . I wish 'd it would never end . Lucy Liu is a throwaway role . Anyone could have played it . The lead actor , Jeremy Northram was the perfect geeky guy . This movie appeals to me who loved War Games , Sneakers , and Track Down . Incredible ! 8-22-06 . Walt D in LV  
1	  7 if you 're a kid - 6 if you claim to be an adult . This semi-sequel to the Lion King sees to spin off side characters Timone and Pumba , retelling the original story through their eyes , including the story of how they met . In the grand tradition of Disney , inferior sequels are made , and occasionally TV series featuring the adventures of minor characters from their biggest hits . You can be as sceptical as you want about this , but kids and fans of the series will likely not care ; their are enough jokes and songs and interesting things to ensure that this is one of the few above average sequels . This works because of the charm of the much-loved central characters , the quick pace , the in-jokes involving the first film , and for older viewers there are some funny gags . The animation is as good as ever , if a little less flamboyant than the original , but the plot here is all about taking it easy , Hakuna Matata . Timone and Pumba decide to watch the events of the first film , frequently stopping mid-film to joke about parts of it , like a real audience . We see how Timone is a near outcast , he feels he does not fit in and decides to go looking beyond what he sees to find his ideal home . On the way he meets Pumba , another outcast and they become friends . Soon they meet Simba , a Lion cub , natural predator of T and P , but they form a trio . However , when Simba realises he must follow his own destiny and leave the group , it is up to the others to decide whether to help or not , and how . Of course the usual Disney elements and themes are here , friendship , good versus evil etc . The plot is simple but works on many levels , making it smarter than your average animated movie . As the CG movies appear , Disney 's traditional form must become smarter , but not forget the roots which made them popular . Toy Story and all that have come since have been clever , with jokes to suit all ages , and it seems this is the way the market is shifting . However , there will always be a place for films like this , and you cannot go wrong buying this for the youngsters . 7 out of 10  
0	  What 's wrong with this film ? Many , many things . The editing tries too hard to look good , and does nothing but confuse the viewer whilst also supplying him / her with a powerful headache . The plot is muddled and obviously prolonged from what started as a short ( story or film ) . The plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story , and this is just stretched out painfully until it reached the minimum length for a feature film . We all know what happens to things when we stretch them , right ? Exactly . They get thinner . In the end , the plot is just so paper-thin that you might even miss it , if you aren't paying attention , which is hard to do when watching this movie . The acting is not even slightly impressive . The characters are poorly written and dull , uninteresting . One of the worst things that are wrong with this film is that apparently , whoever was in charge of the score / soundtrack had no idea what the movie was , or what it was supposed to be about ( not that I blame him , I couldn't figure it out either ) . As a result , half of the music in the film doesn't fit the scenes at all . Also , what was with all the sexual undertones between Eliza Dushku and the main character ? Naturally , this was in order to attract young males , but it was just so cheaply done . And did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film ? On any conceivable level ? At all ? The two creepy guys didn't seem to have anything to do with the film at all , they were just there in order to have some chase scenes . I doubt anyone would really enjoy a film so poorly put together and such a shameless and awful Hollywood-like attempt at a somewhat interesting idea . But I digress . I recommend this to teenagers with low attention spans who don't mind a really bad horror-thriller as long as there 's some sex and gore in it ( although that may only be true for the Killer Cut , which I saw ) . 1/10  
0	  I have never seen anything as awful as this movie for quite some time . The movie was boring , long long and awful plot . The special effects sucks like hell - It 's like watching a movie back in 1999 . It 's a total waste of an hour and a half of my time . Matthew Settle 's performance was quite bad . I saw him in Band of Brothers playing Lt . Speirs , he wasn't THAT bad . In fact not bad at all . But in this film , his acting wasn't convincing enough , it was quite bad and there wasn't any chemistry between the rest of the crew either . Plus , his eyes seems empty like he 's not feeling it . It surprised me , really , because he was good in Band of Brothers . Anyway , don't even bother to watch this movie . It 's a big big BIG waste of time . Even if you had to kill an hour or two , get something else to do besides watching this movie . Trust me , you 'll regret it !  
1	  The plot of this enjoyable MGM musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing , dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the tuneful interludes showcasing the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing Eleanor Powell , abetted by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra , featuring Ziggy Elman , Buddy Rich and Frank Sinatra . Red Skelton shares top billing with Powell , and he and sidekick Bert Lahr are given most of the comedic minutes , although Skelton is more effective when he , if it can be believed , performs as Powell 's love interest , with Virginia O'Brien actually providing most of the film 's humor as the dancer 's companion . The technical brilliance of Powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within which Buddy Rich contributes his drumming skills , and which must be viewed several times in order to permit one 's breathing to catch up with her precision . Director Edward Buzzell utilizes his large cast well to move the action nicely along despite the rather disjointed script with which he must deal , and permits Powell 's cotangent impossibilities to rule the affair , as is appropriate .  
1	  We bought the DVD set of " Es war einmal das Leben " ( German ) / " Once Upon a Time .. Life " ( English ) for our bilingual kids because everyone loved the " Es war einmal der Mensch " ( German ) / " Once Upon a Time .. Man " ( English ) series ( us parents had seen it as kids ) and it has exceeded even high expectations ! The series is very well made , does not show its age , and our kids at various ages really like to watch it . At the same time , they learn things us parents didn't know until way , way later . The series covers everything to do with the human body from organs , all senses , blood , infection , antibodies , and much more in animated 20-25 min episodes . Topics some people may find " sensible " , such as digestion and reproduction are covered in a tasteful , discreet and child-friendly manner ( the reproduction episode starts coverage mainly where the baby starts growing ) , while still ( as typical ) informative and fun . Children are usually fascinated with how their bodies work and through the episodes gain an understanding of this in the context of their environment . The format of the episodes switches between the outside world ( a family with 2 children ) and the inside of the body . For example , in the episode covering infections , the boy cuts himself accidentally and the wound gets infected and the episode covers how the body reacts to this . Similarly , the episodes on the senses , e.g. hearing , seeing , link what happens inside the body to the context of the outside world and the episode on respiration and circulation of oxygen in the blood covers the complete lifecycle including ( briefly ) where the oxygen comes from ( plants ) . This is one of the best ever children 's programs - I would say it 's a must see for every family with kids !  
1	  At first this looked like a boring comedy like The Odd Couple , but when I got into it it turned out to be a really funny film . Basically forgetful ex-comedians Willy Clark ( Golden Globe winner , and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Walter Matthau ) and Al Lewis ( Oscar winning , and Golden Glove nominated George Burns ) were a great comedy duo , and a brought back together to revive their hospital sketch for a TV show . Willy 's nephew , Ben Clark ( Golden Globe winning Richard Benjamin ) is confident they can get together again with no hard feelings for each other , how wrong he is . They cannot get on all the time , they are both forgetful , especially during conversation , but they do it eventually . Also starring Lee Meredith as Nurse in Sketch ( Miss McIntosh ) , Carol DeLuise as Mrs. Doris Green , Al 's Daughter , Rosetta LeNoire as Odessa , Willy 's nurse and Muppets from Space 's F. Murray Abraham as Mechanic . I think the best line of the film is Burns mentioning that Matthau called him " a son of a bitch bastard " . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Writing , Screenplay Adapted From Other Material , it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Screenplay , and it won the Golden Globe Best Motion Picture - Musical / Comedy , and it was nominated for Best Screenplay . Very good !  
0	  Bill ( Buddy Rogers ) is sent to New York by his uncle ( Richard Tucker ) to experience life before he inherits $ 25million . His uncle has paid 3 women Jacqui ( Kathryn Crawford ) , Maxine ( Josephine Dunn ) and Pauline ( Carole Lombard ) to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold-diggers . One such lady Cleo ( Geneva Mitchell ) turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women . We follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that Bill is in New York , while Bill meets with Cleo and another woman . At the end , love is in the air for Bill and one other .. The picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film . The story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice . Rogers isn't that good either . He 's pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone . There is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver ( Roscoe Karns ) and the film is just dull .  
0	  OK , If you 're looking for another Bastketball Diaries , this is completely the wrong film . I revolves around two brothers . Max , the younger , has a major cocaine addiction . Adam , the eldest , is a doctor . This movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible . It however , does not . It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present . Most of the movie focus is on Max and his parting ways . Eventually Adam , can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well ( perscription drugs ) . This movie has almost no climax . Doesn't descend into what cocaine really does to you , has boring and low-budget scenes , and the acting of the eldest brother , Adam , is horrific . I have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards , it is not a heart-wencher . If you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs - rent , if not buy ' The Basketball Diaries ' . And notice the difference . Try to avoid this movie but , if you think you will enjoy . Try and see for yourself ..  
0	  A man discovers that his parents were part of a nuclear experiment in the 50 's and that he now has the power to .. burst into flames ! I was really geared up for this film , what with being directed by the great Toby Hooper and staring wild card Brad Dourif . Unfortunately it didn't rise above the average individual with violent powers movie . Spontaneous Combustion has an interesting premise behind it , unfortunately it never seems to live up to its potential and prolongs its plot too much . The special effects aren't bad though and help to carry the movie to the finale . The cast isn't bad , Dourif does steal the show . All around , no classic but it 's not the worst of its kind either . * out of *  
0	  " Shinobi " is one of those movies that thinks the mere act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of gravitas or emotion to the story . Unfortunately , for the audience to actually care about the people dying , you have to develop the characters , otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence . The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters , all of whom die . OK , so if you can't be bothered to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way , you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible , right ? Nope . Here we have a war between two ninja clans , with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other . They kill each other because the emperor says so . Yet even well after it becomes glaringly obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them dead , they still refuse to abandon their meaningless missions . That 's not stubbornness .. that 's just plain dumb . Fine , fine ! There is no character development , and the plot provides no reasonable rationale for fighting . At least they die fighting in cool action scenes , right ? Yet again , NO ! In fact , many of the fights aren't even fights at all : super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die suddenly ( and lamely , in my opinion ) . I 'm talking about things like , " Lalala , I 'm walking along and I- * neck gets slashed * . " THE END for that character . Not even halfway through the film , I threw my hands up in frustration at the ludicrousness of it .  
1	  One of the all-time great science fiction works , as visionary and thought-provoking as Blade Runner or even Gilliam 's own Brazil . Willis gives his best performance here , but he 's outdone by Pitt 's incredibly frenetic turn that 's unlike anything he 's done before or since . Even Stowe isn't out of her league here , though . The story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about . The climactic scene is beautifully magnificent , and the last lines fit perfectly . The scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way . Lots of dark humour on display here . Fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography . In my top ten .  
1	  On paper , this movie would sound incredibly boring . The idea of a 75-year-old man traveling the country-side on a riding mower certainly doesn't have much appeal to it , but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence . Writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than " The Straight Story . " The perfect example of this is a scene in which Alvin meets a runaway teenage girl . She 's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out . Alvin tells her a story about his own kids , long ago . He had them each take a stick and break it , which they could easily do . Then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them . " That bundle , " he said , " is family . " So many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger . " The Straight Story " realizes that we 're smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions . Alvin 's journey across Iowa is full of such refreshingly un-Hollywood character interactions . Each interaction is full of warmth and humor , and Alvin is so cute riding his mower that we can't help but smile as he makes his way to Wisconsin to make peace with his brother , Lyle , who has suffered a stroke . And the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey . It 's a journey in which Alvin shares his life with everyone he meets-to their benefit and ours . It 's a slow , simple , relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we 've lost with the urbanization of America . " The Straight Story " is the rare live-action " G " - rated movie that truly should not be missed . Grade : A  
0	  It 's hard to know what was going through Per Kristensen and Morten Lindberg 's heads when they wrote " Gayniggers from Outer Space " - the movie is billed as a comedy , yet there are no real jokes beside the crude character names ( Capt . B. Dick , Sgt . Shaved Balls ) . The rest of the movie is a ( presumably ) unintentionally funny affair with ridiculously unsynchronised voice-overs ( with the ' actors ' basically reading their lines with no hint of feeling ) , ' futuristic ' computer displays filled with spelling mistakes , and a plot that makes almost no sense . Even though 65 % of viewers have given this movie a perfect 10 out of 10 , this is the complete opposite of what a good film is . It may be ENTERTAINING to watch with some friends , but this film only deserves about a ' 2 ' out of ten .. slightly higher than the lower possible rating only because of the sheer fact that the writers somehow managed to get some black guys to star in this movie .  
1	  Being from the Philadelphia suburbs and extremely interested in local history , this film provides an excellent vintage view of Philadelphia in the 1940s . There are scenes of downtown , a train station that no longer exists , 30th Street Station-which still does exist , as well as scenes from the Northeast part of the city . Good shots of the old row-homes as they appeared then . The movie gets a bit " chatty " at times - causing the viewer to briefly lose interest .. but the overall storyline is solid and very moving . Anyone who enjoyed this movie should also try to see the film " Bright Victory " , also with local footage of the Valley Forge Army Hospital in Phoenixville , PA - and scenes from downtown Phoenixville . The Army Hospital has since become a college campus . Neither of these films are out on any format and I can't imagine why . I have them both on VHS from home recording , as shown on TCM in recent years . I highly recommend them to any other history buffs out there from my area !  
0	  I registered for IMDb just to comment on this movie . I just got done sitting through this movie , and the only thing that impressed me , was that I somehow had the will power to not stop it . I 've seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what not , but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I 've ever seen in a movie . Most of the sword fighting involves mindlessly swinging the swords back and fourth and hoping the opponent isn't doing the same . I 've seen a good many student films with better action and stronger plots . So now we have a " futuristic " action movie with poor action , and virtually no sign of the future . Most of the movie doesn't even have any action and shows the developing relationship with the Princess and the farmboy / terrorist and his disturbed sister . The movie has multiple plot lines , and none of them really pan out to be worth anything . Part of the problem may have been that I watched the dub , which was quite bad . The entire cast mumbled all their lines so it was hard to follow what was going on . But I got the general idea . ( Knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the movie in my eyes ) If you 've heard about this being a futuristic action / ninja flick , then you 've heard wrong . Thats what I thought it was when I heard about it , and now I 've lost 90 minutes of my life . Don't let this happen to you . Steer well clear of it .  
1	  heres a fun fact , I was the baby in the movie , the one in the crib . :) I am 19 years old now . my parents took me to try out for the part , we lived in Texas at the time . I think I only made like 80 bucks for it , but i wasn't in it very long . My parents said i would cry when i was supposed to be happy and would be happy when i was supposed to cry . I was all mixed up . Strange and funny fact i suppose .. and no I am not a child actress . I am livin ' in San Antonio , workin ' at a walgreens . I graduated here in Texas but I lived in Maryland most my life . This Movie is a great movie , though , good concept . I have seen it several times in my short 19 years .  
0	  I believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war , avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles . Zvezda barely does the first . Zvezda being a Russian war film , I was expecting patriotism , sentimentality , beautiful poetic pictures , a lush score , Slavic cheekbones and cruel Germans . What I didn't need was the naive love non-affair , the unrealistically silly war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film which avoided carefully all historical or political references ( Stalinism , Nazism , Holocaust ) only to end on a passing but nonetheless insulting to our sense of history endnote about " liberating Poland " . A missed opportunity as a film but not as propaganda apparently .  
1	  This is a strange , cerebral , surreal , esoteric film . If there is such a thing as " intellectual horror " cinema , this film is it . I started to get scared and wish there was someone else watching it with me , and it barely has a plot ! I 'm going to have to see this film again multiple times before I feel I really understand it . If you 're the kind of person who likes " My Dinner With Andre " and films by Godard , or if you do a lot of mind-altering drugs , you will probably enjoy this film . Wow .  
0	  Kill Me Later " has an interesting initial premise : a suicidal woman ( Selma Blair ) on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is protects a bank robber ( Max Beesley ) who promises to " kill her later . " The actual execution of this premise , however , falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion . Shoddily written characters who exhibit no motive for their behaviors compromise the quality of acting all around . Lack of character depth especially diminishes Selma Blair 's performance , whose character Shawn vacillates from being morose to acting " cool " and ultimately comes across as a confused dolt . This is unfortunate , as under other circumstances Ms . Blair is an appealing and capable actress . Compounding matters for the worse is director Dana Lustig 's insistence on using rapid cuts , incongruous special effects ( e.g. look for an unintentionally hilarious infrared motorcycle chase at the end ) , and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention spans of the MTV crowd . Certainly Ms . Lustig proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction , but in no way does her skill help overcome the film 's inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end . Clearly , Lustig has a distinct visual style ; however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film . The producers ( Ram Bergman & Lustig ) can be commended for their ability to realize this film : they were able to scare up $ 1.5 million to finance the film , secure a good cast , and get domestic and foreign distribution . This is no small feat for an independent film . Yet given the quality of the product , the result is a mixed bag .  
0	  The volleyball genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters . Thankfully , highly acclaimed director Nelson McCormick has brought us the second best volleyball movie of all time ( rated lower than Side Out and higher than , well , umm ) . However , don't let the cover of this movie decieve you . Kill Shot stars up and coming star Koji as a modern day Sherlock Holmes . Using such high-tech gadgets as a computer that is less powerful than my Gameboy , Koji is able to aid FBI agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime . While there are other actors in the movie , including brief cameos by Denise Richards , a gay negro , and a preposterously ugly and annoying girl , Koji carries this movie on his own . Any fan of movies such as The Matrix or Hackers will definitely love Kill Shot .  
0	  The original exploitation classic-though far from enjoyable on almost any level concerning some guys who turn cats into human flesh eating monsters because the cat food they make is made with people is remade with scifi elements added . The cats can't get enough and when the flesh tainted food runs out the cats turn on their owners . Poorly put together on almost every level this is an example of the absolute bottom of the barrel material that used to actually play movie theaters in the early 1970 's updated with alien cat and dog races battling for supremacy . Director Ted Mikel is a hack , but is so lovable a person ( I generally like the guy thanks to his smile inducing interviews and commentary tracks ) that you can pretty much excuse the garbage he mostly turned out . Mikels wanted to make films and he didn't care how they turned out so long as he was producing something . More power to him , but I wish he wouldn't subject us to his home movies  
0	  Lynch . The man has some really great stuff ! He knows how to disturb us , then reward us by getting us think in different ways . This , however , is altogether different . Dumbland 's reward is 1 % absurd comedy , earned by enduring 99 % stupidity . I may have laughed once , but somewhere around episode 4 I just started watching on fast-forward . Didn't miss a thing . I felt relieved when it ended , and that 's part of the point with this series . It 's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations , rounded out with annoying animation , voices and sound . But recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make Dumbland worthwhile .  
1	  Cliffhanger is what appears to be Slyvester Stallone 's last action movie before he became such an underrated actor . It 's about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars . It has great action sequence 's , edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies .  
1	  If you love The Thin Man series , you will love this movie . Powell 's character of Vance is very similar to his character of Nick Charles . There are even dogs . . . The chemistry between Powell and Astor may not be as fabulous as Powell and Loy , but it isn't half bad .  
0	  I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy ! I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc . But , everything in this movie is bad . Farting jokes , people getting eaten , and the skit about the President all make the movie one of the worst of all time . It 's a really bad film that you have to stay away from . All the " jokes " are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid . The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old . I 'm surprised the Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this .  
1	  The season finale sent mix messages , I felt feelings of joy , and also feelings of being lied to and deceived . Roseanne tells all her viewers that the entire season nine was a lie because her husband , Dan , had died . She also admits the family never won the lottery , and what season 9 was a lie just being how she wished or wanted it to be . I 'm still confused about when she said Becky ended up with David , and Darlene with Mark because Becky and Mark admit to being pregnant . So I believe that is just how she wanted it to be , but it wasn't . So the season finale was good , but sent mixed feelings . I will always be a fan of the show . :)  
0	  I purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental , thinking that the cover looked quite nice . And it was nice , but the movie is trash . I can handle B-grade , I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp ( ie . ' Surf Nazis Must Die ' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be ) , but this was just bland bland bland . Incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences . This movie has very little to offer .  
1	  Conrad Hall went out with a bang . The great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on . He did himself proud as this is one of the best-looking crime films you 'll ever see . Of course , the acting ain't bad when you have Tom Hanks and Paul Newman playing the leads ! The amount of action in here is just right , too : not too much ; not too little . None of the characters in here , frankly , are " good guys " as Hanks is a professional hit-man for town boss Newman . Hanks ' only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him , although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies ! Huh ? As good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is , the real star of this film is cinematographer Hall , who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens . His work is just awesome .  
1	  The first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series ! Mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama ! I love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters ! Explaining just enough to stay excited ! Of course this show has some flaws ! In the first two series there are some characters who for some reason don't show up in the third season ! Many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just aren't there ! Like Rose and her husband ! Where the hell are they ? What happened to them ? Maybe they will return in later episodes ! But it is a little inconsistent ! That being said " Lost " manages to be thrilling every episode ( especially the first two seasons ) ! That is a very hard thing to do ! I do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show ! This is not a bad thing ! It even saves some episodes from getting boring ! One of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters ! You will grow to love these characters ! Good or bad ! But eventually I will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure ! The danger of " Lost " getting canceled due to declining ratings is near ! And that would be devastating !  
0	  What a piece of stupid tripe . I won't even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show . It 's not worth the time . The one comment I will make is - why get such a DUMB , inarticulate doofus to be the star ? ! ? There aren't many more dismal testimonials to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that FOX has stated it will NOT bring back John Doe ( a decent series ) but WILL bring back brain-dead drivel like Joe Millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american public . FOX has lost it , IMHO .  
0	  I was so eager to see this one of my favorite TV shows . I saw Universal trademark followed with a newly acquainted title and theme song which still impress me . Computer animation on some scenery like a solid title name " The Jetsons " or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version splendid and fantastic . Shortly after that till the end .. I couldn't believe my eyes ! How lucky I was that I could forget all I had seen . Just songs by Tiffany and its theme song in new arrangement were in my head . Anyway , I wish to see this space-aged family ( also The Flintstones and Yogi Bear ) in all graphic computer design as Toy story or Bug 's life . The best style for Hanna-Barbera 's in my opinion .  
1	  Life Begins is a wonderful pre-code film starring some of the best of the era . It is set in the maternity ward of a hospital , particularly in the room for the women expected to have trouble . In it is an older woman , a tough unwed mother ( Glenda Farrell ) , a frail young woman , an Italian woman , and the main character ( Loretta Young ) who is spending 20 years in prison for murder . Her husband ( Eric Linden ) is at the hospital at every second aching to know that everything will be okay . Aline MacMahone plays the nurse who is great at her job . This film is highly interesting and entertaining . It isn't terribly shocking in any way , but it is interesting to see such a neglected subject on the silver screen . The acting is brilliant all around . Loretta Young is gorgeous here in her prime . Eric Linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere as can be . His innocence is reminiscent of Michael J. Fox . Glenda Farrell is great as always , a staple of pre-codes and for good reason .  
0	  This film was choppy , incoherent and contrived . It was also an extremely mean-spirited portrayal of women . I rented it because it was listed as a comedy ( that 's a stretch ) , and because the cover said Andie McDowell was acting up a storm in it . She wasn't . I 'm a gal , I watched this film with two guys , and we spent an hour afterwards exclaiming over how bad it was . WARNING : PLOT SUMMARY BELOW ! RAMPANT SPOILERS ! The movie starts out with a fairly hackneyed plot about an older woman who takes up with a younger man , to the severe disapproval of her two jealous single girlfriends . They want her to marry a boring guy their own age who is kind of in love with her . But she 's so happy with her oversexed puppy that you 're rooting for them to stick it out , and sure enough , she decides to marry the guy . But her harpy girlfriend , aided by the wishy-washy one , sets up a plot to trick our heroine into thinking the guy is cheating on her . It works . She has a fight with him , he runs out of the house and is crushed by a truck ( Remember the movie 's title ? ) So now he 's dead , two-thirds of the way through the film . And although our heroine is a school headmistress who spends her time watching over girls , she apparently forgot to use birth control and is pregnant . She 's already broken off relations with her girlfriends , because they were so unsupportive . Alone and pitiful , she decides to marry the boring guy . Did I mention that the boring guy who kind of loves her is a minister ? She had asked him to marry her to the young guy ( nice , huh ? ) , but now she tells him she 'll marry him , and apparently he has no objections to being dicked around in this fashion . But her girlfriends rescue her at the altar and take her home , where they not-quite-confess that they were mostly responsible for the love of her life getting smushed . She has the kid . In the final scene , they leave it in a crib inside her house while they go out on the porch to drink , smoke and be smug . I kid you not , it 's that bad . I left out the part about the cancer red-herring and the harpy 's ridiculous lesbian moment .  
0	  It 's a really cheesy parody of Tomb Raider and some Indiana Jones , the humor 's cheesy , and so is the acting . But after all it is a soft core movie , which is expected and doesn't matter because what you really want is the sex . Which gets me to the biggest problem of all , there barely is any of it . Which makes you feel like you 're watching TV at 3 am and the independent movies are playing and the one that is on was made by some college kid that 's going nowhere in that industry . You 're left a very long time waiting for an actual sex scene , a lot of times you are thinking something is going to happen , then just left hanging . The one ( maybe two , or one with two parts ) that actually goes somewhere is very pleasing though . I personally can't recommend this unless you found it in a clear out bin for a dollar or two . If you lucking for a good movie with a plot and good acting , you don't want this . If you looking for a good soft core lesbian film , you don't want this either .  
1	  I voted excellent for how well the acting was , not for the content . It still gives me chills after reading the book , then watching the movie . Two ex-cons are traveling to their destination to rob a family of money from a safe one of the cons learned about while in prison . During the ride , the tension begins to mount , as the soundtrack in the movie adds to the overall anticipation . After the killers are done with their work at the farm , the following morning the family 's remains are found by the daughter 's church friend . The blood-curdling scream , as the scene pans onto the telephone with the cut cord , really made my blood run cold and gave me chills . That the killers met their just fates is a small comfort for this doomed family . Robert Blake was excellent in his portrayal of Perry Smith . The book was also excellently written by Truman Capote .  
0	  The orders fatal flaw-besides an asinine plot-is that the character 's simply don't resonate or even react . Two examples : A priest , walking through a graveyard late at night , is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits . After fighting them off , he calmly resumes his walk when his buddy come up . " Anything wrong ? " His buddy asks , having seen the attack . " Just some demonic spirits-nothing I couldn't handle . " No reaction , no surprise , just like he 'd changed a tire . His buddy is equally unconcerned .. must be standard priest training .. [ " And then you put the wafer into their mouths . Any questions ? Ok , moving on , Demon Spirit attacks .. " ] Example two : At one point the priests need an answer to a question , and only a demon ( or something , who cared by now ) could provide it . How ? Why , you have to ask a dying man ! So the demon has some random person hung in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the thrashing , gasping man . " Hey , don't kill him ! " or maybe " That 's not nice ! " would have been more realistic then their response . They never ask that they let the man go or stop-in fact , the closest to reacting they get is mild annoyance . They ask their question and go . I had to shut it off at that point-my brain was starting to atrophy . Avoid * / * ( one star out of four )  
0	  In my life I have seen many great and awful movies . I am not an expert in professional reviews , but I have definitely something to say about this one . Firstly , these actors are the worst I have seen .. Their acting is so unreal that you even want to throw away the DVD in the first 2 minutes . I think that these actors were not interested in the quality . Another awful thing is about these dialogs - they are so lame . You sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear them . It seems that your 14 year old son could act better . I feel that this movie had a budget similar to the cost of my 14 year old European car .. Please , if my message reaches you - save your time and money .  
0	  Simon Pegg stars as Sidney Young , a stereotypically clumsy idiot Brit working as a celebrity journalist in this US comedy . After getting a very lucky break he starts work at the highly respected Sharps magazine run by a reliably on form Jeff Bridges in New York . It 's more The Devil Wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead . The unlikely love interest is provided by Kirsten Dunst who works well with Pegg for the laughs but they don't exactly set the screen ablaze with their passion . Sidney goes through some emotional challenges while trying to decide if he should forget about his journalistic principles in order to get material in the magazine . Of course he 's eventually seduced by the glitz and glamour of the world of celebrities especially the young starlet Sophie Maes ( Transformers ' Megan Fox ) . Fans of Shaun of the Dead , Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder if Pegg himself ever experienced similar feelings in real life with this film and to an extent Run Fat Boy Run as one of the UK 's best comic talents being ruined by the US . All in all this is a forgettable comedy . Please come back to us Simon , we can forgive and forget .  
1	  We loved the movie . I am a mother to two little men . I love having a movie I can watch with them where men have integrity and character . Moveis where money is not the most important thing . And family 's are forever and love means more then words . I do wish we saw more of the Davis family . But over all I loved it left me with the same feeling the others did " please don't be over " . We both wish actors would not change . The new actors were good replacement tho . My 9 year old son loved this movie too . asked me to go buy them all . He is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something . Family should all see this move buy it for friends . Help bring back a time of values . We will be Reading the books now that we are hooked . really hope to see more . Be Blessed happy moving  
0	  The main complaint with this film is the fact that I CAN NOT tell who is who . No racism intended , but these Asians look all the same ! I can tell somewhat of the story , but heck thats about as far as it goes . The peoples identities are not a mystery , if they were a mystery I would care about them . Instead I wasn't them off the screen ASAP . Tons of wide shots and silent emotionless faces occupy this movie . Heck is it boring , not only do I not know these people , but they are just sitting there . The production is typical Chinese John Woo , terrible video with blotched scenes . This looks only slightly better than Andy Lau 's " Fulltime Killer " ( Which was a great movie . ) You would think with a decent budget they could at least make it look like 90s Hollywood . I didn't know the Chinese had these art-house beatniks .  
0	  I 'm still trying to decide if this is indeed , the worst film I have ever seen - A very disturbing problem with this film is that real scientists are interviewed , but their footage is edited to make it look as though they support the ideas of the many BSers who populate this film . The BS to signal ratio of the interviews is about ten thousand to one - at the end , the interviewees seem to be saying , " We want you to _ think _ ! " , but they themselves are too lazy to do simple research about things they assert as fact . If you feel that you are open-minded , and wish to expand your consciousness , please be open-minded enough to read some actual books about quantum theory : " Einstein 's Universe " , Nigel Calder ( a slim volume , not a challenge ) , " The Cosmic Code " , by Heinz Pagels . If you can't bring yourself to read a book , please don't complain to reviewers about being " open-minded " . To recap , this film is just unbelievably bad . You know what 's a really good film which questions the nature of reality ? " Thirteenth Floor " , directed by Roland Emmerich , with Craig Bierko , Gretchen Mol , Vincent D'onofrio . Smart , sexy , thought-provoking .  
1	  Wow , alot of reviews for the Devils Experiment are here . Wonderful . My name is Steve and I run Unearthed Films . We just started releasing the Guinea Pig films on DVD for North America . Now before you ask why am I writing a review ? Instead ask why some people bash it . I 'm writing this review because I love the Guinea Pig films . Why do I love em , it 's because they go for the throat and they don't let go . I 've seen it all . Almost every horror film known to man , Argento , Fulci , Bava , Buttgereit . from every underground cult sensation to every Hollywood blockbuster . I 've seen it all and the films that have stuck in my head over the years was definitely the Guinea Pig films . Why because it doesn't try to hide the reason why we watch horror movies in the 1st place . This review is for the Devils Experiment . I find it devoid of story which is fine by me . Why do I watch horror films ? So I can see blood and gore and the torture of people . The Devils Experiment not only delivers but that 's all it is . Pure unadulterated violence . Yeah I like a story but sometimes I just want the gore and the Devils Experiment delivers ten fold . Why do people bash it . Cause they like a story , so that the torture and death of a person can be hidden behind a story . It make em feel better about themselves . We all want blood and gore . It 's just really hard to justify it if it 's not wrapped around a story . The Guinea Pig films have a historical meaning to them and they have created a definitive splash whenever they have been released . I 'm thrilled to be able to release one of the most famous horror series in the world . Maybe I shouldn't have written this review but then again maybe I should . My view is biased cause were releasing them but then again it 's not . I 've always told people to find them and to watch them way before I started Unearthed Films . Sure it 's exploitive and over the top but isn't that why we watch horror films in the 1st place . The Devils Experiment is NOT for everybody . It 's for thrill seekers and gorehounds only . If you think Jason movies and Freddy Krueger movies are awesome then stick to those . But if your on the next level and have seen it all then the Devils Experiment is for you . There is a reason why they haven't been released for over 17 years . They are wrong , disgusting and down right freaky and not something to watch with your mom , unless she is totally cool . Good luck , enjoy and never stop living your life .  
0	  Being a music student myself , I thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch . Little did I know .. ( I had no idea this movie was based on a book by Britney Spears ) This movie was implausible throughout . It 's obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and doesn't know a thing about classical music . Let me give you just a few examples : 1 ) There is NO WAY anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever ! Just having a nice pop voice isn't enough , besides , that 's a different thing altogether - another genre , different technique . It 's like playing the violin when applying for a viola class . 2 ) How come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury ? If she wasn't a singing professor herself , she would have no say in a situation like that , and if she was a singing professor , why weren't we told so ? 3 ) Being able to read music is a necessity if you 're to major in music . 4 ) How did Angela get a hold of that video tape ? That would have been kept confidential , for the jury 's eyes only . Now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just didn't have a clue . I wonder which .. 5 ) The singing professor gave Holly the Carmen song saying she " had the range " , which she clearly did NOT . Yes , she was able to sing the notes , but Carmen is a mezzo-soprano , while Holly 's voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre , not at all compatible with that song . 6 ) Worst of all : Not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music , but it doesn't even try to hide it . The aria that Angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition , a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital , where it is cut short in a disgraceful way - Mozart would roll over in his grave . The Habanera from Carmen sounded a bit weird at times , too , and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music - it 's stiff and boring but hey , add some drums and electric guitars and it 's almost as good as Britney Spears ! I know these are all minor details , but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research . Anyhow , I might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well elaborated . But without that , I really can't find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one : it 's good for a laugh .  
1	  Excellent movie , albeit slightly predictable . I have to comment on Nicole Kidmans acting in this movie . Some of her other works haven't shown the amazing talent this woman has , but Birthday Girl doesn't suffer from this in the slightest . Even without words Kidmans acting shines through .  
1	  Mario is invited to Princess Peach 's castle for cake . When Mario gets there , he finds out that Bowser has kidnapped her ! Mario must save the day again . Unlike the 2-D games , Mario can explore anything he wants to . He can just roam around , climb trees trying to look for 1-Ups , find secrets in levels , and more . You can spend four hours in one level . No time limits . There are 16 worlds , with a number of stages , and there are star doors , which you need a certain number of stars to get into . Once you get in these star doors , you must go through a stage and fight Bowser at the end of the stage . To get to certain worlds , you need a number of stars to get in . You enter the world by going through a painting . There is so much stuff to do and so many hours of gameplay , I don't see how anyone could dislike this game . It 's great . This launch title is the game that insured gamers that the N64 would have a good life . Every 3D plat-form game we know of has something in common with SM64 . Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie are examples that are commonly used . Super Mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3D games . 10 out of 10 . If you have an N64 , buy this game . It 's hard to find used , because no one 's selling this baby for 5 bucks at the pawn shop . A perfect 10 .  
1	  This is hardly a movie at all , but rather a real vaudeville show , filmed for the most part " in proscenium " , and starring some of the greatest stage stars of the day . " Singing in the Bathtub " is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen - be sure to wear your shower cap !  
0	  I am an avid B-Rate horror film buff and have viewed my fair share of slasher pictures , so I have a substantial gauge to judge this film by . It easily ranks in the upper echelon of the worst horror films the 1980 's has to offer . It isn't as scary as Night of the Demons , it isn't as gory as Re-Animator and lacks the camp value of There 's Nothing Out There . That being said , this film has no value . Keep in mind , the movie artwork is for a completely different film . The stills shots on the back of the DVD box aren't taken from this film . VIOLENCE : $ ( There is plenty of violence but we 've seen it all before . A murderer kills nubile students and the occasional facility member by slitting throats and all the other tired methods of murder that horror films utilize ) . NUDITY : None STORY : $ ( The story focuses on Francine Forbes - who wisely changed her name to Forbes Riley after this film was made - who accepts a job teaching at a university . People start to die and Forbes believes the killer is targeting her . Is it her new heartthrob with a checkered past or the libido-crazed student ? To be honest , it is impossible to care because the script doesn't flesh out any character outside Forbes ) . ACTING : $ ( Terrible on all levels . This slasher has the feel of a school production - high school that is because college students could make a better flick than this . Forbes showcases a modicum of talent as does Seminara as one of the students , but everyone else is of the " extras " caliber of acting ) .  
1	  I thought this movie was LOL funny . It 's a fun , not to be taken seriously , movie about one man 's twisted views on life , love , and .. well , ladies " from the lowly bus station skank , to the high-class débutante .. bus station skank . " Tim meadows plays a guy ( Leon Phelps ) who was raised by in a Playboy-style mansion by a Hugh Hefner-esquire father figure , surrounded constantly by beautiful porn models and actresses . When his " father " kicks him out on the street he must learn to fend for himself with nothing but the chauvinistic outlook on life that his youth has taught him .. that and an unfathomable , nearly mystical level of charm and dumb luck . And so the hijinx begin ! If you haven't seen this movie and you enjoy a light-hearted , semi-mindless , comedy / love story , then I highly recommend renting " the Ladies ' Man " .  
1	  Without question , this film has to be one of the greatest .. in cinematic history . I have it watched too many times to remember , and each time it is like I am seeing the film for the first time . Where does one begin ? Meena Kumari 's central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest of her career , followed closely by Sahib Bibi aur Ghulam and Phool aur Pathar . Each movement and nuance of her performance , makes any other Bollywood heroine pale into significance . Her masterly interpretation of Kathak coupled with her grace , tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of Urdhu , is like nothing ever seen on the bollywood screen . Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylised interpretation of the human condition ; the photography , sumptuous cinematography and mise en scene , are so charged with symbolism and meaning , that the viewer is left breathless . Naushads music , is unsurpassed , his knowledge of the music of the courtesan gharanas is incredible , and the way in which he punctuates the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable . My only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the spectacle of total cinema , should watch this epic mediation on life and art .  
1	  Antwone Fisher 's story of childhood neglect and abuse is an inspiration to all among us who witnessed or even experienced the plight of foster children . Abandoned by a troubled mother , Antwone has never met his father . Growing up with " church going " abusers who use the " n-word " not only to intimidate and hurt but also as a term of endearment , as a young man witnessing how his best friend is killed in a hold-up , enduring racial slurs and being teased while serving in the Navy , Antwone 's anger is slowly turned into positive power when counseled by a Navy psychiatrist , and a love enters his life . The scene where Antwone meets his birth mother is one of the most powerful moments in the film . Stunned by the unexpected confrontation , the woman listens in silence to hear the young man tell her how he has lived a life without crime , addictions to drugs , fathering children left and right , all despite his utterly adverse circumstances . If that scene wasn't powerful enough , the very next one drives it home ( and opens the flood gates ) : A reception to welcome home Antwone ; dozens of smiling faces and open arms announcing that HE is part of this great family . One of the messages delivered by this wonderful film is that there are many well-meaning and sincere people working to help orphans and unwanted children . Even if some of the homes and administrators don't seem to care and appear self-serving , many do give it their all . The character who found Antwone 's " file " once he disclosed the circumstances of his birth is one of those " bright lights " in the darkness of the system . The DVD includes a French Language track , various subtitle choices , as well as additional features and information about foster parenting . As a Clevelander I appreciated the location footage . No matter where you are from , you will be deeply moved by this autobiographical gem .  
1	  The story is quite original , but the movie is kinda slow building up to the point where they steal the cars . Its kinda nice though to watch them prepare the stealing too , but the actual stealing should 've been more in picture .. However the stunt work on this movie was excellent and it is definetly a movie you HAVE to see ( 7/10 )  
1	  John Cassavetes ' 1977 film Opening Night is , what critics usually call the work of such a significant artist , ' overlooked ' . It is an excellent film , in its own right , and one of the best portraits of a midlife crisis ever put to film . It 's not a perfect film , in that , at two hours and twenty four minutes it 's about a half hour too long , and there 's a bit too much emphasis on the drunkenness of the lead character Myrtle Gordon , played by Gena Rowlands , the wife of Cassavetes , long after we 've gotten the point . But only Woody Allen 's masterpiece , Another Woman , which also starred Rowlands , eleven years later , is a better portrait of the internal conflicts of an aging woman . Yet , Rowlands did win the Best Actress Award at the Berlin Film Festival for this portrayal , and it was well deserved . Often this film , written by Cassavetes , is easily compared to his earlier - and inferior - film , A Woman Under The Influence , but it 's a spurious comparison . Rowlands ' character in that film is severely mentally disturbed from the start , as well as coming from a blue collar background , while her characters in this film and in Allen 's film are both artists who are haunted by apparitions . In this film it 's the ghost of a dead young woman who can be seen as Myrtle 's younger doppelganger , while in Allen 's film it 's her character 's own past . Many critics have taken this film to be a portrait of an alcoholic , seeing Myrtle surround herself with enablers , such as a stage manager who tells her , during opening night , ' I 've seen a lot of drunks in my time , but I 've never seen anyone as drunk as you who could stand up . You 're great ! ' , but this is wrong , for alcohol isn't her problem - nor is her chain smoking . They are merely diversions from whatever thing is really compelling her to her own destruction , and much to Cassavetes ' credit , as a storyteller , he never lets us find out exactly what 's wrong with Myrtle , and despite her coming through in the end , there 's no reason to expect that she has really resolved anything of consequence . This sort of end without resolution links Cassavetes directly with the more daring European directors of the recent past , who were comfortable in not revealing everything to an audience , and forcing their viewers to cogitate , even if it hurts . Yet , the film recapitulates perfectly the effect of a drunk or fever lifting out of the fog , and as such the viewer again is subliminally involved in its drama . Whether or not Myrtle Gordon does recover , after the film 's universe irises about her is left for each and every viewer to decide , and as we have seen before that lid closes , one 's choices do matter .  
1	  In the ' 70s , Charlton Heston starred in sci-fi flicks of varying quality . " Soylent Green " is one of the better ones . He plays Robert Thorn , a detective in 2022 New York . In this future , most food is so expensive that everyone needs a product called Soylent Green . But when Thorn finds out the unsavory truth about this product , he finds himself on the run . I guess that it 's only natural that this movie should seem dated to us nowadays . But even so , it still brings up interesting questions about what will become of our agriculture . Also starring Leigh Taylor-Young , Chuck Connors , Brock Peters , Joseph Cotten and Edward G. Robinson ( in his final role ) .  
0	  ( aka : DEMONS II ) Made for Italian TV although shot in English and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier DEMONS films . It was supposed to be simply titled , THE OGRE , which is how director Lamberto Bava had released it . An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer . The woman ( Virginia Bryant ) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine-cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging down from the ceiling . It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it . It drips what looks like green paint . Of course the husband doesn't believe any of this . The villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it . But then the OGRE itself appears in what looks like some kind of 16th Centaury costume with what looks like a wolf 's head attached to it and it 's attracted to the scent of orchids . The films isn't really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring . There 's no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool . The OGRE itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family 's Jeep Cherokee . The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was defective , with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film , a flaw I hope Shriek has since corrected . Extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains how this wasn't a sequel , etc .. etc .. along with some trailers to other Shriek DVD releases . This is pretty standard stuff . 3 out of 10  
1	  Miike makes a children 's adventure film , not unlike The Neverending Story . It 's actually one of my least favorite of the director 's films . Even the worst Miike is better than a good many films , though , and The Great Yokai War has a lot in it that 's worth recommending . It 's at least as loud and obnoxious as most American kiddie flicks . I might think kids themselves would find a lot to like in it ( the DVD includes an English dub ) , but , like all of Miike 's films , it can tend to move very slowly . That means you 've got kind of a weird unevenness , where sometimes there 's a loud action sequence and the next scene will drag on forever as characters converse . The story itself isn't very good , either , and Miike 's perpetual flaw of incoherency rears its ugly head . Most of what I liked came from the technical side of things . This has to be Miike 's most expensive movie , and it looks fantastic . " Yokai " are Japanese spirits , and they come in all different , fantastical forms , and the costume designers , special effects crew , and everyone else involved in the designs just did an outstanding job . I 've seen the 1968 film this one is supposedly based on ( Yokai Monsters : Spook Warfare ) , and the cheesy rubber-suit monsters you can find there have been transformed into more believable entities using state of the art makeup and special effects . I especially liked the look of one of the bad guys ( or girls , in this case ) , Agi , who sports dark eye shadow , a tight , white outfit , a white beehive hairdo and a whip . She 's played , incidentally , by Chiaki Kuriyama , whom you might remember as Lucy Liu 's teenage henchgirl in Kill Bill : Vol . 1 . The hero of the film is played by Ryunosuke Kamiki , who provided voices for Miyazaki 's Spirited Away and Howl 's Moving Castle .  
1	  Obviously , there wasn't a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production . But the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot . I mean brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other ( great ) Chinese films . I first saw this when I was 14 years old , I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything ..  
0	  This one came out during the Western genre’s last gasp ; unfortunately , it emerges to be a very minor and altogether unsatisfactory effort – even if made by and with veterans in the field ! To begin with , the plot offers nothing remotely new : James Coburn escapes from a chain gang , intent on killing the man ( now retired ) who put him there – Charlton Heston . While the latter lays a trap for him , Coburn outwits Heston by kidnapping his daughter ( Barbara Hershey ) . Naturally , the former lawman – accompanied by Hershey’s greenhorn fiancé ( Chris Mitchum ) – sets out in pursuit of Coburn and his followers , all of whom broke jail along with him . Rather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub-Fordian style , McLaglen goes for a Sam Peckinpah approach – with which he’s never fully at ease : repellent characters , plenty of violence , and the sexual tension generated by Hershey’s presence among Coburn’s lusty bunch . Incidentally , Heston and Coburn had previously appeared together in a Sam Peckinpah Western – the troubled MAJOR DUNDEE ( 1965 ; I really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on DVD , though I recently taped the theatrical version in pan-and-scan format off TCM UK ) . Anyway , the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for ( suggested also by the title ) : then again , both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most American of genres – WILL PENNY ( 1968 ) for Heston and Coburn with PAT GARRETT & BILLY THE KID ( 1973 ) ! At least , though , Heston maintains a modicum of dignity here – his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half-breed Coburn by anticipating what his next move will be ; the latter , however , tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax ( relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing Heston to witness his associates’ gang-rape of Hershey ) . Apart from the latter , this lengthy sequence sees Heston try to fool Coburn with a trick borrowed from his own EL CID ( 1961 ) , the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced Heston and the violent death of the two ‘obsolete’ protagonists ( as was his fashion , Heston’s demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice ! ) . The supporting cast includes Michael Parks as the ineffectual town sheriff , Jorge Rivero as Coburn’s Mexican lieutenant , and Larry Wilcox – of the TV series CHiPs ! – as the youngest member of Coburn’s gang who’s assigned the task of watching over Hershey ( while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away ! ) . Jerry Goldsmith contributes a flavorful but , at the same time , unremarkable score .  
1	  After all these years , of Peter O'Tool 's brilliant , costly giving of his Soul , film after film , at last , Hollywood tosses him an Oscar recently . Country Dance showed up one night late , and of course , blew me out of my complainant niche in my alleged " Life " . How does he do it ? York again also is brilliant in this kind of play . Both psychological battleships loaded for bear .. Bravo to author , director , cast , and camera crew . No wonder the Nazi 's lost to these Irish , Scot , English blends .. brutal honesty hurts .. back in the 70 's , when I personally believed " honesty " was pure and absolutely vital to trust . I have modified my edgy extremes , and will settle for more human , warm flaws within myself and others . Forgiveness allows humanity to have a reverse gear , and allows us to fix our own bull headed egos and erotic mistakes ..  
0	  It seems that several of the people who have reviewed this movie only watched it in the first place because it was filmed near where they live . How 's that for a ringing endorsement ? If this movie was filmed near where I lived I wouldn't be mentioning it in my review . It is horrid ! Several reviews state that this film is a spoof or tongue-in-cheek horror movie , it is neither . It is sad to see this film reviewed as a comedy as that makes it not only a bad attempt at a horror film but as a comedy as well . I did laugh though , at how unbelievably bad the film was . This movie has 2 good things going for it , the mask and the weapon of choice , unfortunately it would have been more interesting watching an hour and a half of the mask and weapon laying on a table then watching this garbage . The social commentary behind the film is also laughable , juvenile and stupid . Don't bother with this movie , you 've already wasted time reading this review don't waste anymore on this movie . Arrgghh ! It 's infuriating that movies like this even get made . I was expecting the entire cast a crew to be credited to Alan Smithee , a name used when a person , usually a director , doesn't want to be credited with a movie because it 's so bad . There is nothing redeeming in this movie , I spent $ 1.19 on the rental and feel I was ripped off . Avoid . 1 out of 10  
1	  Ettore Scola is one of the most important Italian directors . My parents and I watched together " C'eravamo tanto amati " on a summer night : we liked it , but we didn't love it as we loved " A special day " . I believe Ettore Scola is pretty underrated : we often forget to remember him , maybe because his latest films were disappointing . And so , yesterday night , my mum and I sat on our sofa to enjoy this masterpiece . Writing , direction , cinematography , score and production design were sober and accurate , but the thing I liked the most was the chemistry between Loren and Mastroianni . They 're both excellent actors and play the main roles of Antonietta and Gabriele . Antonietta is an housewife : married with a fanatic Fascist , she has six children but her husband wants to have another child to get a prize for the huge families . Gabriele is simply an Anti-Fascist . They spend together a special day , that special day of 1938 when Hitler came to Rome visiting Mussolini . I don't want to spoil anymore about the plot : go looking for this film !  
1	  I have to admit to enjoying bad movies . I love them I watch all of them . Horror especially . My friends and I all gather after a hard week at school and work , rent some crazy tapes , order a pizza and have a blast . This one had a great box , so I was expecting less than usual . The story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above-ground layers bulldozed , and the other underground layers are simply covered up . The inhabitants of this neighborrhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave . This wakes up some zombies . From this point on , it 's chunk-city . The gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll . OK , it 's not great art , but this one , with its in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening . Actually , it was one of the best " party tapes " I have ever had the pleasure of watching . And you could tell it was done on no money , with a bunch of crazy people . There are hundreds of zombies , and the Director looks like Brendan Frazer ( he has a cameo ) and it is just a wild trip .  
1	  Izzard was both hysterical and insightful in his humor . He definitely represents his own little niche in the comedic world . It 's a pity more Americans won't see this stand-up routine due to its PAL-only availability .  
0	  SPOILER ALERT In this generic and forgettable action movie , Lorenzo Lamas does his usual tough guy / pretty boy act , and his future real life ex Kathleen Kinmont is ass kicking hot chick Alexa . OJ Simpson is a detective , coasting by on his since vanished genial public persona . Translation : cable TV filler . There isn't enough skin to qualify this as a Guilty Pleasure . The script has some gaping holes . Best / Worst Moment : In one jarring scene , OJ 's partner expresses his aversion to the morgue . OJ responds that some of the bodies are pretty hot , or words to that effect . This vague necrophilia reference is offensive enough ; but in light of the murders committed shortly after this movie was released , it is truly appalling , and therefore entertaining in an unintentional , horrible way . I was so startled that I laughed until champagne came out of my nose . Now THAT 'S a Guilty Pleasure . BC  
1	  Carla works for a property developer 's where she excels in being unattractive , unappreciated and desperate . She is also deaf . Her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company . Help arrives in the form of Paul , a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environment . An implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and Carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week . When Carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits Paul 's criminality by having him steal the contract back . The colleague quickly realises that she 's behind the robbery , but when he confronts her , Paul 's readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price . Paul is given a ' going over ' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt . He formulates a plan which utilises Carla 's unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers . It 's now Carla 's turn to enter a frightening new world . The fourth feature from director Jacques Audiard , ' READ MY LIPS ' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners . The leads are excellent ; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect . Carla 's first meeting with Paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was , until very recently , a jailbird . Emmanuelle Devos , who plays Carla , has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame . Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he 's receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed . Like many French films , ' READ MY LIPS ' appears , at first , to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it 's probably about everything . The only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of Paul 's parole officer ; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac . It was the French ' New Wave ' of the 60 's that first introduced the concept of ' genre ' to film making and I 've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it ; so it 's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre , or better still , defy it .  
1	  MacArthur is a great movie with a great story about a great manGeneral Douglas MacArthur . This is of course , the story of one of America 's great military figures , and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory . Though there is a continuity issue ( there may be others ) e.g. MacArthur 's speech portrayed in the film as his 1962 address to the U.S. Military Academy on accepting the Thayer award did not contain the phrase " old soldiers never die ; they just fade away . " ( That was in his speech to Congress upon his dismissal by President Truman ) in 1951 for his alleged insubordination ( these two did not see eye to eye ! ) Gregory Peck is im-Peck-able as the general who vowed he would return to the Philippines in World War II . The film moves quickly and easily with the General , his family and his staff from the beginning of the Second World War to the end of his service career . This film would be of much greater significance to one familiar with both WW II and the Korean War . Nevertheless , Peck 's portrayal of this great man who fought the twin evils of fascism and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed . " In war there is no substitute for victory . "  
0	  Originally called The Changer . The Nostril Picker is a poorly constructed tale about a loner named Joe Bukowski ( Carl Zschering ) who " likes em young " . Unable to socially interact with girls he bumps into a tramp who teaches him a special Vietnamese chant . This " chant " involves whistling ' London Bridge is Falling Down ' whilst hopping around like an epileptic morris dancer . Nonetheless , Ugly Joe tries it out and hey presto ! He is now a girl . Ideally he needs to be a young guy in order attract girls . But lets not talk about ideals here - this film was made in 1983 and released in 1993 , in an ideal world it should have NEVER been released . The Film Asylum dubbed this horror hokum as " mind numbing , ham handed story telling " . Its worse than that . The Nostril Picker really takes the biscuit , in fact the whole god-damn cookie jar . Terribly scripted dialogue delivered by brain-dead actors , a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist . Just when things couldn't get any more absurd the story goes off on its own nonsensical tangent . For instance , Joe decides to kill the girls by changing back into himself . But i thought he wanted to get close to them ? Not content with being a murderer Joe also turns into a cannibal and eats some of his victims , of which there were only around 3-4 . The highlight of this terrible movie involves Joe picking up a hooker ( Steven Andrews ) then taking " her " back to his apartment . What happens next defies belief .. Joe turns back into a man , but also discovers the hooker is a man . How does he react ? Well , in a Benny Hill-esquire fashion , he chases " her " around the apartment with a bunch of squirty dildo 's only to trip up on a blow up doll . God knows what Patrick J Matthews and Stephen Hodge were thinking of . At least this scene paved the way for another priceless moment . This involved the male hooker reporting the incident to a curly haired police officer with a 2-bit joke shop ' cop ' uniform . The hilarious acting is a must see . Especially the hooker 's inability at saying " dildo " and his demand for " satisfaction " . Apart from the above mentioned incident this monotonous slash flick was a complete bore . You know a movie 's bad when the DVD trailers were more exciting . Normally , i 'd fast forward to the good bits , only there weren't any here . The main action sequences involved Joe simply stabbing his victims repeatedly . Forget quick cuts , Matthews utilizes fadeouts ( one during a stab scene ) to limit any form of suspense there might already be . One girl 's non-reaction to her fingers being chopped off is laughable . Normally i 'd relish the words " uncut " but in this case they were far from a blessing . Just more agonizing cinematic torture . The whole movie felt like an unedited episode of Midsummer Murders , only less entertaining . I 'd hate to see the cut version . To sum up , The Nostril picker is the most unentertaining thing i 've seen since Richard Hammond 's 5 O ' Clock Show . Dismal performances made worse by a terribly tinny soundtrack and bad dubbing . Don't be fooled by the box label , this is NOT a cult classic unless it qualifies for the lets use shitty horror dvds for coffee coasters cult . Which i think it does . Unless re-edited to 30 minutes stay away from this coma inducing mess .  
1	  I have read many comments on this site criticizing The Blob for being cheesy and or campy . The movie has been faulted for amateurish acting and weak special effects . What would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget , locally produced ( Valley Forge PA ) Christian Shorts . Let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious . That fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits . For what it was meant to be , this film is excellent . I have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts , Blair Witch Project was one of them , that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot . BWP was pure excrement . The Blob , on the other hand , was well thought out , well scripted , and thoroughly entertaining . The scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy . The scene in the doctor 's office with the Blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece . Bottom line is , I love this movie . I challenge anyone out there to take $ 120,000.00 , inflated for today 's dollar value , and make a film anywhere near as entertaining and or as successful as the Blob . It just can't be done . PERIOD ! Thank you for taking time to read this review .  
0	  BTK Killer , Green River Killer , Zodiac Killer ; the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is , he loves his crap . I 've never seen a Ulli Lommel film but I was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful . Like the movies I said in the beginning don't even equal a six when added together ! After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is . He is the worst out there . The credits wouldn't end as the pathetic movie started and quickly I noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in . The acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots . The editing is easily the worst . This movie made no sense and I unbearably couldn't take it anymore as it wouldn't end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie . I couldn't take it anymore . I wasted 45 minutes of my life . DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP !  
0	  Last of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films and a good thing too , as this is easily the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years . No mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people , who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride . She finds Tarzan and Jane , who try to protect her . George Zucco is present as a potentially villainous High Priest but isn't used to his full advantage . Also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player / singer who goes into song every so often . Even the " great " Robert Florey can't aid this one . * 1/2 ( of four )  
0	  Watching it now it 's still as skanky and sexist as I remember . comes from a time when girls were " Dolly Birds " and basically men 's playthings . It 's hard to take in that it is from the Hammer studios and the fact it 's available on DVD when good films are not . Our nations shame where the working class are portrayed as work shy layabouts or worse ! Trouble is you can't help feeling nostalgic for a Clippie on a bus . Try to hold your stomach contents when you see Olive in a fluffy ? Blue " saucy " nightie or something similar like Shirley Bassey used to wear for a concert in 1972 . Warning this film shows the illegal practice of towing a motorcycle combo by a red double decker bus , which I 've been informed is not a Routemaster but a Bristol . Look just don't bother watch something decent instead like Porridge or Dad 's Army .. or a fly crawling up a wall .  
0	  Another made for TV piece of junk ! This is an insult of a war movie ( I use the word movie in it 's loosest possible form ! ) I thought Telly Savalas 's career had hit rock bottom when he did the voice over on that visit Birmingham video that 's shown on Tarrant on TV on a semi regular basis , but then I 'd forgot he was involved in this ! I 'd tried to push it into my subconscious memory , but cable TV brought the memory kicking and screaming out of me ! I like the bit ( laughs sarcastically ! ) in the film which claims to be a scene from Liverpool in the forties , but it 's blatantly a shot of Zagreb Cathedral in the late eighties . Also the steam train the Commando 's are training on shows the JZ ( Jugoslavia Zeleznice , or Yugoslav state railways ) logo 's on the side of the locomotive quite clearly , even though the makers have tried to black them out . Why not just film in the UK , if that 's where most of the film is set ? Cheap rubbish , and a waste of celluloid !  
1	  Sure , it 's a 50 's drive-in special , but don't let that fool you . In my little book , there are a number of intelligent touches with unexpected dollops of humor . Catch the redoubtable Mrs. Porter who 's supposed to keep an eye on the doc 's place . She not only steals the scene , but darn near the whole movie . And where did those indie producers come up with the bucks to film in color , a wise decision , since the blob would not show up well in b & w . Yes , the result is ragged around the edges as the number of goofs illustrate . But except for several of the teens , the non-Hollywood cast performs well . Then too , the byplay among hot-rodders and cops comes across as lively and entertaining . Pretty darn good for a couple of directors more at home in a pulpit than on a sound stage . Apparently , they wanted to portray teens in a positive light at a time when the screen was filled with " juvenile delinquents " . Then again , the 27-year old McQueen hardly qualifies in the age department , but manages the hot-rodder attitude anyway . The movie was a hit at the time , helped along , no doubt , by the catchy title tune that got a lot of radio play . And except for the unfortunate final effects , the movie is still a lot of fun , drive-in or no drive-in . Meanwhile , I 'm awaiting the blob 's return now that the polar icecap is turning into , shall we say , refrigerator water .  
0	  seriously what the hell was this movie about , simply stupid , i 'd give it 0 but , 1 " awful " is the lowest you can go , seriously this movie is not worth watching , waste of time , i don't know what the hell is wrong with you guys voting this movie 7 out of 10 , i seriously can make a better movie than this , hire some other unemployed people , ' n i promise i 'll make a movie better than this , this movie was so bad , that i 'll never watch a movie starring Steve Carrel again , bottom line don't waste your time to download it off the net or rent it , i 'd nominate this movie for the worst movie of the century i mean the worst is Something Gotta give but after that this is the second  
1	  This is one of the funniest movies I have seen . I watched it on DVD , and the disc does not have any special features , or even a menu , but that is not necessarily what I care about . I tend to judge movies on a case by case basis , depending on , among other things , if it is a big studio production or a smaller film . This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things . That said , I believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that I have seen . I enjoyed the acting of all of the major players . I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin . Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines . The character portrayed by Claire Forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people , but I have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life 's decisions as her character does . That helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor . This is not a movie for children , obviously , but it does NOT engage in gratuitous sex and nudity . There is quite a bit of adult language , though , but it can sometimes be very funny . ( In particular , Alan Arkin 's character , who can't even swear correctly . ) Also watch for the cameos from known character actors .  
0	  Recap : Something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of Antarctica . The mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on Antarctica . Julian Rome , a former SETI-worker , is brought in to decipher the message . Problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his , and the situation quickly turns awkward , especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him . And the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly . Soon the object is in the open . The mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity . It is decided to open the object , but just before that is done , Julian decodes the signal . " Do not open " . But too late , and the object explodes as it is finally breached , and two things unleashed on earth . The first is an alien , that had been dormant in the object , and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff . And Washington , that is suspiciously updated on this historic event , decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth . So a Russian nuclear submarine , carrying nuclear weapons is sent to Antarctica . Comments : The movie holds a few surprises . One is Carl Lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance , and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful , well worked through and a lot better than expected . Unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own , and this time not in a good way . Actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes . It is never really explained why Washington know so much , why Washington is able to command Russian submarines , why the object is in the Antarctic and has woken up now . It is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable English . Some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to Earth before and knew the language ( and obviously chose English , why ? ) . But then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the Earth from the virus , send their " Do not open " message encoded ! And finally the end is as open as an end can be . The movie is a little entertaining but too much energy ( from me ) must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot . Therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good . 3/10  
0	  Given the history of the director of this movie , it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through . I was at the European premiere last night and one of the Executive Producers was there . He was yet to see the movie and , boy , was he in for a surprise . I have not read the book that this is based upon , nor do I know if it highly rated or appreciated , but I have read " Captain Correlli 's Mandolin " and given how poorly that was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was , I can only presume that something similar has happened here . The acting wasn't bad albeit that there were a couple-too-many raised eyebrows from Farrell . Honestly , I can't believed how little I cared for any character in this movie . Situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness . Donald Sutherland 's part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door , says something and closes it again . I kept looking at my watch when I wasn't cringing at the dialogue on the screen . I have never walked out on a movie but I was tempted to start during this . I gave this movie a score of ' 2 ' for reasons which seem horrendously shallow to me but these are the best things that I can say about this movie . The first is that I really enjoyed the all-too-short earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek got naked and looked beautiful . I can say little else positive about this movie . Don't ask the dust anything , it can't talk !  
0	  I remember I loved this movie when it came out . I was 12 years old , had a Commodore 64 and loved to play Rambo on it . I was therefore really thrilled when I got to buy this movie really cheap . I put it in my VCR and started up : Man this movie is really bad ! Sylvester Stallone says like 3 words in the entire movie ( except for that awful sentimental speech at the end ) , and has the same expression on his face all the way . And that stupid love thing in the middle , it 's just so amazingly predictable . I just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else .  
1	  The pre-release version of 1933 's " Baby Face " would make an ideal introduction to a corporate seminar on sexual harassment . Mentored by a Nietszchean professor , Lily Powers rises from a life of easy virtue at her father 's speakeasy to a rapid climb up the corporate ladder at a large bank . Because each rung of the ladder is an executive with his brain below his belt and his ethics locked in the vault , the film has no victims , except Lily 's childhood , which was destroyed by an abusive exploitative father . The destructive relationship with her father suggests Lily 's hidden motive for using men to advance without regard for their fate . While Lily is cynical and obvious in her approach , the men she targets willingly betray wives and fiancés to trade jobs for sexual favors . Perhaps the bank failures in the 1930 's owed less to economics than to morally corrupt executives distracted by ambitious women . The plot moves fast , and the camera amusingly moves from window to window up the façade of the office building as Lily climbs ever higher . Barbara Stanwyck reveled in tough hard-bitten roles , and she is in top form here . Sentiment does not intrude when she is ready to climb the next rung . Only her African-American confidante , Chico , receives Lily 's affection , trust , and loyalty . In more enlightened times , the fresh natural beauty of Theresa Harris , who plays Chico , would have had the men throwing the furs and penthouses at her . Stanwyck often appears overly made-up and stiffly coiffed in comparison to Harris . However , despite Stanwyck 's tough demeanor , obvious tactics , and artificial visage , she manages to leave a trail of duped and seduced men , including Douglass Dumbrille , Donald Cook , and a young John Wayne . The preferred version of " Baby Face " is the 76-minute restored cut . The edited release version of the film shyly turns from the hard facts , which the longer cut restores and makes explicit . Perhaps Darryl Zanuck , who wrote the story under an assumed name , intended a lesson by quoting from Nietszche , whose views on women were controversial . However , despite Alphonse Ethier 's lectures and advice not to be defeated by life , Lily 's grab for power and money likely owed more to her upbringing and her father than to her professorial mentor . However , the philosophy is but a distraction . Short , fast paced , and entertaining , " Baby Face " is as contemporary in its morality as " Wall Street . " Substitute Gordon Gecko for Nietszche , and Lily could have declared her guiding philosophy to be " greed is good . "  
0	  Serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind . Instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains . The mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems . There is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters . The mad doctor 's nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy . The results are not good . This is a class C film with OK acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors . There isn't much zombie action in this one and the effects , while adequate , are nothing special . You can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes . Watch out for some nudity and bad language .  
0	  The first episode set the bar quite high i thought . It starred William Hurt as a hit-man who is contracted to kill a toymaker . We are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill , indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all . Returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers , this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business . But he is in for a night of hell , the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war , driving jeeps , shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters ! . The special effects are good for a TV show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive , sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not . I wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist . This gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment , the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one . Stephen King adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception  
1	  Loved the movie . I even liked most of the actors in it . But , for me Ms . Davis ' very poor attempt at an accent , and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch . Seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as Ms . Davis they would be laughed off the screen . I really think she ' phoned this one in ' . Now if it had Myrna Loy or Ingrid Bergman playing the part of the wife I would have enjoyed it much more . I guess I just don't ' get ' Bette Davis . I 've always thought of her as an actor that ' plays herself ' no matter what role she 's in . The possible exception is Now Voyager . I 'm sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful ( and I hope civil ) detail how I am totally wrong on this . But , I 'll continue to watch the movies she 's in because I like the stories / writing / supporting casts , but , I 'll always be thinking , of different actresses that could have done a better job .  
1	  Let me first state that while I have viewed every episode of StarTrek at least twice , I do not consider myself a Trekker or Trekkie . Those are people who live in their parents basement and attend conventions wearing costumes with pointed rubber ears . I gave this movie a seven casting aside the fiction historical errors . The acting was better than average , but the plot held no surprises . They tried very hard to reverse engineer the technology but still the special effects were just to great a temptation . Now as to the historical errors , if you call them that , the first Capitan to pilot the Enterprise was Commander April , then Capt . Pike , Jim Kirk , etc .. According to a statement made by both Riker and Kirk we dicovered the Klingons and educated them and gave them the technology ( that 's the reason a prime directive was created ) but like I said these are no reason to discredit this fine series . I hope the plots will get deeper , and then special effects can take a backseat .  
0	  .. is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire : scandal , sex , celebrity , power . Kirsten Dunst grins her way through her role as silent movie star Marion Davies like she thinks she 's in " Legally Blonde . " The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him . Eddie Izzard is pretty good , except that he 's playing Charlie Chaplin , and is about , oh , 125 lbs too heavy for the part ? Hard to believe this hamfisted , uneven wreck was directed by Peter Bogdanovich , but then again , he hasn't made a watchable movie in , what ? 30 years ? Sometimes , there 's just no coming back .  
0	  A text prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house , but I think the more apt word is " entropy . " Good grief , what slobs these two babes are ! George ( Seymour Cassell ) is alone in his San Francisco office and his monstrously expensive home in Tiburon while his wife and child are away in San Diego . Two girls ( Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna ) knock on his door , asking directions . Well , it 's raining , and they 're shivering like two drenched pitiful kittens , and they 're not sure of the address they 're looking for , and , what with one thing and another , George invites them to come in and partake of his pizza by the fire . All three of them wind up in George 's bath tub and there follows about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure , triple exposure , quadruple exposure , and dodekakuple exposure . They spend the night in a threesome and the next morning the girls fix him breakfast . But something has gotten slightly cockeyed because Georgie 's guests gobble everything down with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup all over the linen and - " You eat like ANIMALS ! " , George exclaims and tells them to get out . In his dreams . Now , don't get me wrong . Sondra Locke is an extraordinary looking young blond with cobalt-blue eyes and Colleen Camp bounces around like a superball . You gotta say , they breed ' em mighty cute down there in Shelbyville , Tennessee , where Locke comes from , and they breed ' em with bodacious tushes too , as we can't help but note after the first five or ten minutes . But when the girls go berserk , so does the movie . The film is thereafter bathed in a garish green light . The pair put on ghoulish makeup and make gargoyle faces at themselves in the mirrors . They brain a delivery boy and then drown him to make sure . They cuss up a storm and smash windows and furniture . They have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table from one another , licking food and then jumping each other 's bones . And Georgie ? They first render Georgie unconscious with mace ( which contains nothing that you can't find in that little red bottle of McIlheny 's Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet ) , tie him up , pour flour and milk all over him , subject him to a psychotic trial , put him through one of those Tolstoy-type semi-executions , slap him around , dress up in outlandish costumes , then prance out on him and his virtually destroyed upper-middle-class home , and are dispatched by a delivery van ex machina . As for the acting , it 's as if someone had told Georgie , " First act polite to these girls , then act panicked after you 're tied up . " And to the girls : " First act shy , unwilling to impose on anyone , then act crazy . " And that 's it . The photography and location work are straight out of a 1970s porn movie . I 'm not sure that suggests a total lack of skill . It takes effort and talent to turn San Francisco ugly . The score gives us two Leitmotivs . Georgie 's is some pop tune with lyrics about " being free " and " giving in . " Jackson and Donna 's is a catchy rinky-tink thing called " My Good Old Dad . " I approve of the moral lesson behind the story , though . There are some things you should simply not give in to , even though they might look like a lot of fun at first . All very educational .  
1	  Stargate is the best show ever . All the actors are absolutely perfect for there roles . I love the connection between the characters . If you have not seen this show I very highly recommend it . Although this program is compared to Star trek a lot of the time it actually can't be because it is completely different . I am a star trek fan but i would definitely rate this show well above any of the star treks . Unfortunately I live in New Zealand and we do not get Stargate on our TV so if i want to see it I have to buy the DVDs and season 10 is not out here yet so i can not see it for quite some time ( which is highly depressing ) . However this program is very very good and is a must see , but be warned it is highly addictive . So in summery I Love Stargate ( and Amanda Tapping ) .  
0	  I just saw " If " I can remember the advertisements for the movie from 1968 , so I was interested in finally seeing it . It may be the perspective of an American who never went to a British public school and misses some of the social references , but I thought the movie was awful . For one thing , as others have pointed out , it takes almost the entire movie for the much ballyhooed at the time revolt to break out . For another , whether the last scene is real or imagined , what occurs isn't a revolt , but a shooting rampage . There 's quite a difference . I know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events , but one cannot avoid doing it here . One person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the end of movie to the incidents at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech . But if there 's a scintilla of difference between Klebold , Harris and Cho on the one hand and Travis ( Malcom McDowell ) on the other , I simply can't see it . All four of them were under the delusion that their gunfire is going to purify a f_-ed up world that they arrogantly take no responsibility for . Which brings me to : why the hell are Travis and his chums even in a school they so despise ? They are adults , or close to it . They 're not in a military prison , like the inmates in " The Hill , " a much better British film from about the same time . No one is forcing them to go to College and take beatings from the the whips , except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wake-up about the nature of their sons . I had the opportunity in college to join a frat , except I couldn't stand to be given silly , cruel orders by delinquents claiming to be my prospective " brothers . " I took the consequences of not having the " in " with the Establishment that frats provide , and I can't say I regretted it . If Travis fancies himself the second coming of Lenin ( whose unbearded picture hangs prominently in his room ) he 's free to go out and organize a fitter 's union or work for Michael Foot in the next election . If he wants to be Jack Kerouac , then get on the road and start writing . What possible benefit is he giving the world in joyriding a motorcycle and getting drunk in his room ? Sometimes reviewers have to be like the person who responded to the scene in " Last Tango In Paris " where Brando mopes about having had to go on a date with cow manure on his shoes . In the real world , the person said , a listener would say " Why didn't you scrape it off ? Change your shoes ? " - Don't allow fictional characters to lay a self-pity trip on you because you don't dare point out an common-sense alternative course of action for them . So it is here .  
1	  This is 2009 and this way underrated gem has lost nothing of the power it had 31 years ago . It connects a pretty wide variety of different characters and stories without appearing to be cluttered . Clothes and music might have changed over time , but in the end this is a story that will never lose its up-to-dateness . And especially this movie does the job pretty well . Of course it is cheesy at times , but very touching as well . Jodie Foster 's performance is striking , and it shows that she is really a natural born actress who showed her true potential especially in her earlier movies . Don't miss this one .  
1	  Timeless musical gem , with Gene Kelly in top form , stylish direction by Vincente Minnelli , and wonderful musical numbers . It is great entertainment from start to finish , one of those films that people watch with a smile and say " they don't make ' em like they used to ! " But they never did quite make them like this . The climactic 25 minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history . Movie magic , clearly derived from the heart and soul of everyone involved . A must see !  
0	  Well , what to say .. Having seen the film I still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was ? V.Dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point .. I had to look away from the screen , I was feeling physically sick .. Round and Round and Round .. You get the idea .. VERY VERY Strange accents at many points .. " Those that should know , know " Unless your getting in for free , or being paid to watch it , or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something .. then forget it ..  
0	  This typically melodramatic Bollywood film has inexplicably become a favorite of Western critics . The script is ludicrous , the acting is over-the-top , and it looks cheesy . The only reasons for watching this soap opera are the wonderful songs sung by Mangeshkar and the curtain call of the legendary Meena Kumari . Watching the actress , who was ill during the filming and would drink herself to death at age 40 shortly after the film was released , has the same fascination as watching a train wreck . Her ex-husband , Amrohi , wrote and directed , but lacks the competency to execute either task well . Bollywood has produced far better films .  
0	  A scientist and his girl friend are out driving when his speeding causes a car crash . He escapes unharmed but she is decapitated . He saves her head , brings it to his house and keeps it alive ( ! ) . He then proceeds to search out models and strippers for the perfect body for the head . His crippled assistant watches over the head which starts talking and has a telepathic ( or telepathetic ) link to a deformed monster kept in the closet .. As you can see , this is pretty stupid stuff , but I had a certain fondness for it . When I grew up in the late 1970s , a local TV station showed this movie about 20 times each year ( no exaggeration ) . They showed it always on Saturday afternoon TV-uncut . Seeing this on TV back then was great ! Explicit blood and gore along with a gruesome monster and sleazy sexploitation-who cares if it was good ? Seeing it now I realize how lousy this really is . The acting is perfectly wretched , the production values are nonexistent , the script is pretty dumb and ( aside from the still pretty disgusting gore ) this is dull stuff . There 's also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly great monster at the end . Also add in an ending which leaves tons of loose ends . On one hand this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film . On the other its utter trash . Either way , it 's not a good movie but is a must-see ( for one time only ) for horror and gore fans . Also the head 's laugh is pretty creepy . Note the end credits which gets the TITLE wrong ( calling it " The HEAD That Wouldn't Die " ) !  
0	  This movie is so awful , it is hard to find the right words to describe it ! At first the story is so ridiculous . A narrow-minded human can write a better plot ! The actors are boring and untalented , perhaps they were compelled to play in this cheesy Film . The camera receptions of the National Forest are the only good in this whole movie . I should feel ashame , because I paid for this lousy Picture . Hopefully nobody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a worse storyline :-)  
0	  This movie is a crappy and forgettable Sean Connery vehicle . The performances are generally crappy especially by Capshaw , Fishburne , and the usually solid Ed Harris . Connery seems miscast as a Harvard Academic . The movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along . It is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels . The movie squanders an excellent supporting cast . George Plimpton also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to Connery as they debate the death penalty . The violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery / thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree . The scripting and direction are extremely poor . Connery 's charisma and screen presence are the film 's only virtue . Manipulative , Violent , and Ridiculous . 2/10 Avoid It .  
0	  This film was so bad i had to fast forward most of it to get to the good bits . Hah what good bits ? the only bit that was worth it was the ending ( those who have seen the film will know what i mean ) . I expected a lot from this film like a underworld meets dawn of the dead meets Freddy vs . Jason but what i got was this crap . Story was forgettable , the cast was used badly and what was the director thinking when he made this . This could have been a great but i turned out to be the most boring film i have ever watched . OK so what if there was a nice bit of T and A , I was after the gore and i was bitterly disappointed . Don't expect a film thats good but if you want a bad cheesy horror then by all means watch this and see how a horror movie SHOULDN'T BE DONE .  
0	  This was far and away the worst movie i 've ever seen in my entire life . It was slow , boring , not scary , not funny , not dramatic , not entertaining . Sarah Michelle Gellar was up to her old playbook of empty expressions of fright and shock . She couldn't sell her character nor could anyone else in the picture . For those who thought the Grudge was ' kind of alright ' then don't go see this unless you get enjoyment out of wasting your time and your life . I saw this movie for free by the way so I don't want this to come across as a rant from a guy that lost 8 bucks on a terrible movie . It was free , it still sucked , I hated it . Avoid .  
1	  Lorna Green ( Janine Reynaud ) is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club . She falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon . It 's quite possible that , through a form of hypnotic suggestion , someone ( .. a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet ) is guiding Lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love-making is about to begin . After the murders within her fantasies are committed , Lorna awakens bewildered , often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality . If someone asked me how to describe this particular work from Franco , I 'd say it 's elegant & difficult . By now , you 've probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about , since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream . Franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by Godard early in his career , as far as film-making style , and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience . And , as you read from the reaction of the user comments here .. some like this decision , others find the style labouring , dull , and bewildering . I 'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head , but even Franco himself , when quizzed by critics who watched " Succubus " , admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it ! Some might say that " Succubus " was merely a precursor to his more admired work , " Venus in Furs " , considered his masterwork by Franco-faithful , because it also adopts the surreal , dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn't truly know whether he / she is experiencing something real or imagined . In a sense , like the protagonist , we are experiencing the same type of confusion .. certainly , " Succubus " is unconventional film-making where we aren't given the keys to what is exactly going on . And , a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn't help matters . " Succubus " is also populated by beatnik types and " poet-speak " , Corman 's film , " A Bucket of Blood " poked fun at . My personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between Lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party .. quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually . Great locations and jazz score .. I liked this film myself , although I can understand why it does receive a negative reaction . Loved that one scene at the posh party with Lorna , a wee bit drunk , writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig ( .. equally wasted ) rush her in an embrace of kisses .  
0	  This movie has a slew of great adult stars but fails to get you interested in a way an adult film should . Among all the stars you couldn't get your kicks from any of the scenes . The movie is shot in a dream like middle age set which is embarrassingly cheesy . The acting is worse than Keanu Reeves , the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talk about their kid in college , and the dialogue is the worse I have seen in a movie . The plot also was worse by ten fold . I 'd stick to the amateur route . The audio commentary was useless since it 's a skin flick but even then that was bad too . Unless your a diehard Jenna Jameson fan there is little here . 4/10  
1	  I enjoyed every moment of this movie , even though I knew they could never really be together . With the life expectancy of a Bomber pilot being only six weeks , It made me feel for all of those women and men back in the 1940 's who must have lived this story .  
1	  I noticed this movie was getting trashed well before it hit the theaters and I too didn't have high hopes for it . I figured it was another " You Got Served " type of movie with some nice dance moves and horrid acting . I was at the theater and deciding between this and Meet the Spartans and picked this . To my surprise the acting wasn't bad at all and the movie was actually pretty good . The fact that it has a lower rating than You Got Served is absolutely ridiculous . Instead of listening to the garbage posted on here I recommend going to see a matinée showing of this movie so you don't spend too much . I think you will be pleasantly surprised with how wrong everyone has been about it . When it comes to dance movies this is certainly one of the better ones with far superior acting than many of the other ones . Go see the movie and judge for yourself . Hopefully the rating will rise after it comes out on DVD and more people check the movie out instead of judging it based on comments before the movie released . edit The movie is now moving closer to its correct rating . Over 1000 people have given it a rating of 9 , a bit too high but at least it is helping to offset the ridiculous votes of 1 .  
1	  I just found the IMDb and searched this film and I was moved almost to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this film as I did when 6 or so years old in 1967 ? . I saw it before the Jungle Book so I was Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgli for the next year . I burst into tears at the cinema when the boy turned into the Eagle and always wanted to see the film again . When we got home we had a Roast chicken dinner and I got the wish bone and guess who I wished to be ? My dad then said ' I bet you wished to be an Eagle ' and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone guesses so more tears and a little resentment to this day for not being able to fly away ..  
1	  If any movie stands out extremely with the actors ' acting skills , this is probably the one . I 've never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way , but having a strong feeling . The movie was disturbing at moments . However , the movie was terrible at editing . The movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs , yet they feel out of place . Like Karisma is getting beat up , and the same time SRK is fighting ( comically ) with the police officers . The Ishq Kamina song was very out of place . On top of that , the movie is overly glossy in the beginning . The direction was not bad , but certainly nothing one can brag about . I have to say that the actors ' were chosen very wisely . Without them , this movie would not have an impact . Karisma Kapoor has given her best role to date , and this looks very good on her record after Zubeidaa and Fiza . She looks pretty in the first half , and I 've never seen an actress scream of emotion and anger as well as her . What is most ironic is this is probably her weakest written role to date . Nana Patekar was excellent as her father-in-law . Not much to say about him , besides this is a role made for him . Deepti Naval as the mother-in-law was excellent especially in her final scene . Though she doesn't have much to say , her facial expressions and body language was good . The other good performance was the little kid . He was adorable , and is sure to bring tears to the viewer 's eyes . The movie was probably saved desperately by their performances . Sanjay Kapoor was all right , but he didn't have much to do . Shahrukh Khan was wasted in his bad boyish type role . One thing that brought the audience to the theater was Ishq Kamina . The song picturization and dancing is perfect for the crude lyrics of the song . And boy Aish is mad hot . However , the song belonged to be in another movie only because it came at the worst moment ever . People may have come to the movie for Aish , but they won't brag too much about it after-wards . Hum Tum Miley was properly paced , but seemed to drag as the suspense mood was leaving throughout the movie . Damroo Bhaje was boring and nothing to rave about . Dil Ne Pukara is too boring of a song to get the mood of the movie . Despite the poor editing , the performances alone make it a must see .  
1	  Richard Dix decided to retire and so Michael Duane took his place playing the role as Ted Nichols who meets up with a young French girl named Alice Dupres Barkley , ( Lenore Aubert ) . This couple only knew each other for two days and they decided to get married by a Justice of the Peace ( Judge ) and it is pouring rain when they pull up to the Judge 's home and find out he is not home and will not return until the next day . As the couple are inside the house you see some one lift up the hood of their car and takes an automobile part from the engine . Once you see this event happening you realize this couple is in for a big surprise and the story beings to reveal a very mysterious event which surrounds Alice Barkley and so poor Ted Nichols starts out with plenty of trouble and no marriage . Good mystery , but I missed Richard Dix . Enjoy .  
0	  This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I have ever seen . It is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps . The movie starts out bad ( I would rate the first few minutes of the film a 1/10 ) and then it get progressively worse , minute by minute . The only way to rate it at all would be some kind of abyssmal spiraling negative number that grows for ninety , long minutes . Unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video . Somehow the video manages even to make cute , scantily clad females and sex look grotesque and distasteful . This movie is amazingly bad . I would say it would be better to be locked up with the TITANIC theme playing over and over and with Buscemi 's character from ESCAPE FROM LA droning on in your ear than to watch this movie . The sequels are not nearly as bad . If you have to rent a Troma film , get Tromeo and Juliette or Combat Shock . I would rather watch 5 Tony Little infomercials back to back than to see CLASS of NUKEM HIGH again . Don't get me wrong , it took some kind of criminal genius to make a movie this terrible and if ever a movie deserved an award for being awful , this is it .  
1	  I couldn't help but feel that this could have been a bigger movie than it was . The screenplay is highly intelligent and it just seemed that it could have been opened up in a way more reminiscent of Seven . Not by changing the story - I think mainly through the cinematography . The cinematography was the only thing that I found to be holding back the film . On the other hand , the pacing was absolutely on point . Whoever worked on the editing really did their job well . And I thought Bill Paxton did a great job of directing . Now away from the technical stuff .. This movie threw me for a loop . SPOILER AHEAD ! All along , I really felt that Bill Paxton was crazy and then when Adam finally took the FBI agent to the Rose Garden to show him where the bodies were buried and revealed who he was , I got thrown for a loop . I had suspected the first part of the twist but what really threw me was when he touches the agent and sees the agent murder his mother and the fact that the agent too ( without any words spoken , simply by touch ) sees it again with Adam and asks him how he knew . My dilemma was not that it was yet another twist thrown in but the almost ungraspable idea that this man and his father were not crazy but actually picked out ' bad guys ' so to speak , knowing their sins and crimes already . I don't endorse an eye for an eye so I didn't leave the film being able to believe that they were doing God 's work . Instead I chose to believe that they were both clairvoyant and that the father had gone off the deep end one day from it and through the things that he subjected his sons to , disturbed them permanently also . That was my interpretation but the vexing thing about the film was it 's like a house of cards and a never-ending circle and what is the correct interpretation of the disturbing events you 've sat through . It 's definitely one of those movies where I 'd love to be able to meet the writer so I could just ask him what the real meaning was to it all . Were they crazy and psychotic ? Were they simply telepathic and took license because of it ? Or did they have some sort of appearance from God ? And if so , was it God or the Devil disguising himself as God . My friends and I found ourselves talking about it all night trying to figure out what was what and what the filmmakers had thought was the answer when they made this movie . A definitely perplexing and thought invoking film with some very disturbing but certainly not sensationalistic elements to it . It 's not a perfect film , but it definitely is it 's own thing . Great directorial work and acting by Bill Paxton and the child that played Fenton was extremely good . I hope he doesn't end up relegated to the child actor syndrome as he seems to have a lot of promise . I gave this movie a good vote for the majority of the components that make a film , but I would have voted higher if wasn't for the feeling that something ( although I can't pinpoint what ) was off and if it hadn't have been , the movie would have gone to an even higher level . Still , a definite recommend , especially for those that are inquisitive .  
1	  I remember watching this is its original airing in 1962 as a five or six year old and REALLY enjoying this . I recently had the opportunity to watch it again , for the first time since then , as it was aired on " Walt Disney Presents " on the Disney Channel . I 'd forgotten most of it , and some of it was geared towards kids , but it was still enjoyable . I can't wait to show it to my niece and nephews .  
1	  I first saw this at a foreign film festival . It 's a beautifully paced nail-biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold . It 's all shot in a gritty , grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses - but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states beautifully ( note : Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there ) . There 's a lot of humor and some romance , too . I don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises , so I 'll just say this heist film starts from a great script , and the directing and performances are top notch . DARKNESS IN TALLIN is simply the fastest and most nerve-racking example of its genre - I 'd put it up against RAFIFI , TOPKAPI , and it 's miles ahead of the new OCEAN 'S 11 , though ( deliberately ) not as glossy . RENT OR BUY IT NOW .  
1	  It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any Cartwright men . After all Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage . And any woman who got involved with Adam , Hoss , and Little Joe were going to end up dying because we couldn't get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic TV western . Perhaps if Bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the Cartwrights . People have relationships , some go good , some not so good , it 's just life . And we 're less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don't have to kill the character off to keep the survivor 's nobility intact . But that 's if Bonanza were done today . But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped , the secret of Bonanza 's success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons . Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name . His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three children . The kids were all different in personality , but all came together in a pinch . The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution . I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys . Just the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that . Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written out of the show . Rumor has it he didn't care for the noble Cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious . Perhaps if it were done now , he 'd have liked it better in the way I describe . This was just the beginning for Michael Landon , how many people get three hit TV shows to their credit . Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control . Little Joe was the youngest , most hot headed , but the most romantic of the Cartwrights . When Roberts left . the show kept going with the two younger sons , but when big Dan Blocker left , the heart went out of Bonanza . Other characters had been added on by that time , David Canary , Tim Matheson , and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel . But big , loyal , but a little thick Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights . His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family . So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history . I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City . It doesn't look anything like what you see in Bonanza . But near Lake Tahoe , just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credits , is the Cartwright home , the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction . Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans , the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are real . And if they weren't real , they should have been .  
1	  A talking parrot isn't a hugely imaginative idea for a new film , but Paulie turns a simple idea into a brilliant , heartwarming film that will delight the whole family . It manages to bridge the gap between sentimental trash and cruel harshness during Marie and Paulie 's separation , and all the events in the film lead to a hugely satisfying emotional conclusion . The animal training is well-done - everyone will be affected when Paulie spreads his wings and flies for the first time . Paulie is a great character and should have received way more success , though this film wasn't a highlight of 1998 , unlike Saving Private Ryan . This hour and a half will surely be an enjoyable one and one that you will remember . Paulie 's story is a moving , sad , happy and interesting one - from the moment he is first seen to the moment he is united with his original owner , you will enjoy following him and watching him learning about friendship and the grim realities of life along the way . Not one to be missed if you have any kind of heart or emotion . 9/10  
1	  Nobody truly understands the logic behind the numbering of Italian zombie-flicks , but  honestly  why would we bother ? Every single film in the Zombi - " series " delivers great fun , nasty gore and gratuitous shocks and " Zombi 3 " is no exception to this , despite all the production difficulties that occurred whilst shooting . This film began as an interesting Lucio Fulci project , who had to elaborate further on his " Zombi 2 " success , but it ended up being a typical Bruno Mattei product with more flaws and stolen ideas from previous films . The screenplay is hopelessly inept and ignores all forms of continuity , every ingenious idea from George A. Romero 's " Night of the Living Dead " and " The Crazies " is shamelessly repeated here and the acting performances are truly miserable and painful to look at . Yet all this didn't upset me for one moment because the sublime over-the-top gore compensates for everything ! On a secret army base at the Phillipines , scientists completed the bacterial warfare virus " Death One " and prepare it for transport . After a failing attempt to steal the virus , the infected corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie-ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist village . The last group of survivors has to battle hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls that received instructions to kill everything that moves in the contaminated area . This movie is comparable to Umberto Lenzi 's " Nightmare City " . Truly Bad .. but incredibly entertaining with fast-paced action sequences and several very creative zombie-madness situations . The undead birds were original , for example , and the whole zombie birth sequence at the deserted hospital was pretty cool as well . The infamous flying head scene is not nearly as awful as it 's made up to be and it belongs perfectly in this cheesy and thoroughly pleasant Italian zombie flick . Recommended to the fans ; don't mind the negative reviews .  
1	  This movie documents a transformative experience for a group of young men , and the experience of watching it is in itself transformative for the viewer . Few movies even aspire to this level of transcendence , and I can think of no other movie - documentary or drama - that achieves it . There is no other movie in which I have both laughed so much and cried so much . Yes , it is about DMD and accessible travel ; on those issues alone , it is a worthwhile venture , but it is more . It is about friendship . It is about life itself , about living every day that you 're alive . And it 's a great , fun , adventurous narrative . This is why God created the cinema ! See this movie !  
0	  Everyone else who has commented negatively about this film have done excellent analysis as to why this film is so bloody awful . I wasn't going to comment , but the film just bugs me so much , and the writer / director in particular . So I must toss in my hat to join the naysayers . I saw the original " Wicker Man " and really loved the cornucopia of music , sensuality , paganism in a modern world , and the clash of theological beliefs . This said , I am not part of the crowd that thinks remakes of great movies shouldn't be done . For example , I liked the original 1950 's " Invasion of the Body Snatchers " , but equally enjoyed the 1978 remake . Both films can stand on their own . Another example is " The Thing " . The original , as campy as it looks compared to today 's standards , has a lot to be proud of in the 1982 remake with Kurt Russell ( my all time favorite horror movie ) . So that small minority of people who like " The Wicker Man " re-make can not accuse me of dissing this piece of crap just because it 's a re-make . This film solidified for me Neil LaBute 's sexism and misogynistic tendencies . It also made me wonder how executives , wanting to make a serious thriller , would green light a product that is so anti-female . There are too many scenes of Cage hitting women just because he 's frustrated with them thwarting his investigation of a missing girl . would he react like this off the island in other cases where suspects aren't forthcoming ? The original created a society in which men and women are equal participants in a Goddess based religion . The threat to the main character came from everyone , male and female . There was no sexual hierarchy . The metaphor of bees , drones etc was a bit heavy handed and convenient ( " The drone must die ! " ) , especially when Cage 's character has bee allergies . I kept wondering why the men on the island didn't fight back and use mere physicality to stop these women from treating them like grunts . These were not women with special supernatural powers , and half of them seemed to be pregnant , the other half old and fat , and the rest girls and thin blonde waifs , so if the men really wanted to escape they could do what most men do when they hate women . Physically dominate them . There didn't seem to be any guns or weapons beyond cutting tools to hold them if they were unhappy . But if they were content being drones , why make them unable to speak ? They could be used as a threat to Cage because they will defend the community . They are drones because Neil LaBute seems to believe that a society ran by women would leave men castrated . ( That movie was made already . " The Stepford Wives " anyone ? ) Classic symptoms from men who are afraid of what may happen if women got their sh * t together and were truly equal citizens . The problem with the man-hating female society is that it makes uninteresting movie viewing and creates unintentional humor when Cage starts knocking women out . I belief LaBute should 've left the society an egalitarian one , kept the sexuality and uninhibited lasciviousness , and pushed buttons of discomfort in regards to the children on that island . No one likes pedophiles or children to be sexually exploited . So how would a cop react if he saw lewd acts performed by adults with children around ? There would be a logical mental leap that these children are abused , thus , an urgency created to save the missing child and get help for all the children . LaBute has said he created the fiancé and daughter story thread to give Cage 's character an incentive to search . I don't think you need that . Any child abused will make an adult react to save them . The irony of course would be that the child Cage " saves " ultimately brings him death . The dialogue was contrived and campy . The whole third act was hilarious . The audience I saw it with guffawed ( and later booed at the end ) . I just thought the movie started off wrong when the letter arrived written in the fancy handwriting and all the flashbacks cutting into to show how wounded Cage is . We don't need that . Just show him arriving on the island for an investigation of a missing child . Most of us in America have seen " Law & Order " and other cop procedurals . We come into the movie as if we are Cage 's partner solving a mystery . So much potential .. wasted . Neil LaBute , stick to talking head pictures for people who enjoy your male angst-ridden plays and flicks of that sort . Stay with your own company of men . Leave the thrillers for people who understand thrillers . Here is your jar of honey . I 'll watch that .  
1	  This isn't exactly a great film , but I admire the writers and director for trying something a little different . The film 's main theme is fate and small , seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future . In some ways this reminds me of the film SLIDING DOORS , though instead of focusing on one random event , seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion . Plus , an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene-like he 's some sort of omnipotent being but there 's absolutely no explanation of him in the film ( like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY ) . The DVD jacket shows just Audrey Tautou . This is capitalize on her success in AMELIE , though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role . The pace is brisk , the acting fine and the conclusion isn't bad at all . The only reason I didn't score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and I think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots .  
1	  Guys , you got to watch this awesome movie . At the end of this movie you will have a strong passion and profundity imbued into yourselves . The acting of the two characters , Billy Sunday and Carl Brashear deeply touches the heart from inside . This movie is about principles , dignity , patriotism and HONOR . You will hear Chief Carl Brashear say , the Navy has greatest tradition of all - Honor - practiced thoroughly by these two characters . Mere glances of these characters during the movie fills you with enthusiasm . Dialogue delivery of this movie is perfect . You can't find any flaws in the dialogues . What the Master Chief Billy says roams in and out of your mind for a long time after watching the movie . Please watch this movie .  
1	  Ealing Studios , a television and film production company based in West London , claims to be the oldest film studio in the world . Though it has been consistently churning out films and television programmes since the 1930s , its golden age was most certainly between 1948 and 1955 , when it produced a string of comedy masterpieces , many starring the great Alec Guinness . Such well-known titles include ' Whisky Galore ! ( 1949 ) , ' ' Passport to Pimlico ( 1949 ) , ' ' Kind Hearts and Coronets ( 1949 ) , ' ' The Lavender Hill Mob ( 1951 ) , ' ' The Titfield Thunderbolt ( 1953 ) ' and ' The Ladykillers ( 1955 ) . ' One of Ealing Studio 's most beloved films , ' The Man in the White Suit , ' was released in 1951 , and starred Alec Guiness as Sidney Stratton , a brilliant inventor who engineers a remarkable fabric , an invention that unexpectedly makes him more enemies than friends . Sidney Stratton is poor and unappreciated , but he has scientific talent in great abundance . Due to his under-qualification , the only jobs he is able to get are as a janitor or labourer at any of the large textile factories , where he secretly undertakes his own experiments using the company 's own money and equipment . After being found out and ejected countless times , Sidney is convinced that he is only weeks away from a momentous scientific discovery that will revolutionise the textiles industry . Encouraged by his daughter Daphne ( Joan Greenwood ) , textile mill owner Alan Birnley ( Cecil Parker ) takes a keen interest in Sidney 's exploits and agrees to finance any further work . After numerous failed attempts and quite a few earth-shattering explosions , Sidney eventually unveils his amazing creation : an almost-luminous white fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out . If Sidney thought that his invention would make him a hero , then he was sorely disappointed . The all-powerful bosses of textiles industry , headed by the frail Sir John Kierlaw ( Ernest Thesiger ) , unite to ensure that the revolutionary invention , which could completely cripple their businesses , never goes into full-scale production . Likewise , the humble labourers in the workers ' union hear of Sidney 's creation and also set out to erase it from existence , fearing for their jobs . The inventor , however , is convinced that the ever-lasting fabric will bring relief and happiness to many , and refuses to give in to the demand of others , despite being threatened with violence and offered ₤250,000 in compensation . Throughout all his troubles to announce his invention to the media , only one person offers Sidney her complete sympathy and support , Birnley 's daughter Daphne , who is engaged to be married to somebody else but falls in love with Sidney 's plight anyway . ' The Man in the White Suit ' is a clever and hilarious comedy , made great by a witty script ( written by John Dighton , Roger MacDougall and director Alexander Mackendrick ) and a quirky and charismatic performance from an inimitable Alec Guinness . There are also a few good-natured swipes at capitalism , and of how big industries can hold back progress for the sake of their own monetary situations , though we can certainly see the arguments for either side of the debate .  
0	  It saddens me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors , locations and genres , i.e. Douglas , Sutherland , Washington , D.C. and political thriller , but ' The Sentinel ' really hits a low . It 's like they had a great idea up front , signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew improvise the rest . And I wish I could blame it on yet another bland performance from Basinger ( not only do I feel she 's one of the worst actors in Hollywood , but I 'm still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one , and definitely the only bad actor in the film , to win an acting Oscar for ' L.A. Confidential . ' ) But she wasn't the only problem . Sutherland , who I love as Jack Bauer on ' 24 ' once again playsJack . I miss his old ' A Time to Kill ' or ' A Few Good Men ' days . Douglas certainly took a hiatus from acting and phoned this one in . Plot : Someone , some Secret Service traitor , wants the President dead and Douglas is ( haphazardly ) being framed . Will someone believe him ? Actually , no spoiler here : as quickly as they came up with that subplot half-way through , it 's over before you know it . And why did someone ( s ) want the President dead ? Is that to be revealed in the sequel ? Too many plot holes , too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable ' The Sentinel ' is . If you only see one movie a year , you may not know who the mole is , but anyone who 's familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one ' Law & Order ' episode you 'll know in the first few frames . Was it terrible ? Not really , the cinematography was good , and despite Sutherland playing Jack again , he 's still got it .  
1	  Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Hayao Miyazaki film . After seeing it for the first time I 'm glad to say that it doesn't disappoint . On the contrary , you get your time 's worth , which means ( as to what Miyazaki 's films are concern ) , that is nothing less than excellent ! Produced early in his cinematic career , Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies , with strong ( but young ) female characters , forced to grow up due to external circumstances , helped out by very interesting ( and some times lovable ) supporting characters . And , of course , the usual battle of nature versus civilization , flying machines ( lots of it ! ) , beautiful painted sceneries  but alas , no pigs ( at least that i 've noticed , after all I have only seen it once ) . Never the less , Miyazaki had already got his theatrical debut two years earlier , with Nausicãa , which was a dress rehearsal for Princess Mononoke , his magnum opus . Castle in the Sky is set a bit a part from these two , with a soft action packed first 30 minutes , resembling his TV series Conan , and his directed episodes of Meitantei Holmes . In here we are introduced to Sheeta , a girl who literally falls from the sky , only to be found by Pazu , a young boy working in a little countryside mining town . Intrigued by her amnesia and suspecting a connection between her and the mysterious flying city of Laputa , Pazu is set on helping her find out where she came from , whilst escaping the army and a gang of air pirates . As the movie progresses , the plot gets heavier and much more interesting , revealing Myiazaki at his best . The sound track is very reminiscent of Spirited Away , ( or vice versa , as Castle in the sky was produced first ) , and much like its director , Joe Hisaishi _ the composer _ starts with a very light score , that gets more complex and beautifully fitting as the plot goes forward ! A note to the English dubbing , with a good interpretation from the two lead stars , although Anna Paquin 's Sheeta has a very thick accent ( which the actress still had at that point in her career ) , and a heads up for Mark Hamil as Muska , making up for a delighting yet devilish villain ! Don't miss this one people !  
1	  After you 've seen this small likable and comical film , you will for sure feel better . Cheer to Yves B. Pelletier to have given birth to this small magnificent movie moment , that according to me , will be recognized as a marking movie of year 2004 for the Quebec . The actors Isabelle Blais , Emmanuel Bilodeau , Sylvie Moreau and Stéphane Gagnon all deliver a touching performance . I would compare the feeling that this wonderful story gives you to the ones that Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amélie Poulain have given me . So if you 've like the Jean-Pierre Jeunet magnificent film , I would say that you should also like the first movie from Yves B. Pelletier , Les Aimants  
1	  i don't care if you 'd like my comment or no but i think that you who write that the movie isn't good .. you 're so obsessed by the films of Hollywood that you can't see how good is this movie i 'm not a fan of Jay Chou but i like his play and not only his .. and may be you think that there is not a big sense in the idea and may be you think it 's not so interesting but look deeply there is more than action in the movies more than love and passion and tears there is more than USA in the world and it 's good :) really good . And it cost a lot to do it so please don't criticize the actors the directors cause you don't know how hard they work for you to be happy in this hour and a half watching them thank you :)  
0	  ' Utter Crap ' pretty well sums up what this .. " movie " was . I 'd rather examine the colon of an African elephant with a penlight than sit through this again . I think I 've wasted enough time watching this " movie " - I don't need to waste more by commenting on it further ..  
0	  Okay , let me coin a new word here : polyphobia : The fear of polyamorous relationships . This is yet another in a long line of movies which start out by titillating audiences about some kind of threesome , only to turn on a dime and go all preachy about how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamistic solution . Only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person , and this director is not one of them . Bleh . Mark my words : a few decades from now , polyphobia is going to be just as big a faux-pas as homophobia , but guess who was too close-minded to realize this ? Right the first time : the producers of this movie . And so many like it . Why even make a ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned type of movie like this ? Priding itself on being limitlessly open-minded about gayness , it completely overlooks the fact that we live in an age where monogamy is turning into sequential monogamy , which in turn in turning into swinging and polyamory . Open your eyes , people , please ! This is a disappointing , run of the mill chick-flick . ( But , damn , I gotta say , Heather Graham is the cutest thing alive . ) 3 out of 10 .  
0	  I 've seen the Gator Bait films , and this is almost exactly the same thing as those . A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them . The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones ( although not very far ) is that the sexual content is not glorified . There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film , but not for a second is it ever sexy . Some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive , but that 's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience 's need to see this woman seek revenge . This is a weak film , it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers . I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral , but I was glad to see that , since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead , it was not meant to pass off as a T & A film . B-movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality , and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a B-movie and contains more than its share of nudity , the nudity does not drive the plot . On the other hand , the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists . These men are evolutionary drop-outs just like they were in the Gator Bait films , and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them , but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless B-movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind , but instead it simply satisfies the audience 's desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve . The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks . Oddly , the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity ( although not by much ) , but it is by far the most painful to watch . We are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible ( it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller , staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord ) , but again , this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with . ( spoilers ) You know that this is all the movie means to do , since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed . The woman does not live happily ever after , she doesn't write her book , she doesn't leave and never return to that nightmare place , she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks . But hey , what more did you expect ? Oh , and did you read the tagline ? If you decide to waste your time watching this , try and find any man getting broken or burned . I was really looking forward to those  
1	  " The House That Dripped Blood " is one of the better anthology films of the time period . * SPOILERS * Tracking down a missing film star , Inspector Holloway , ( John Bennett ) finds that the last reported sighting was in a large mansion in the countryside . During the course of looking through the house , he is told four different stories about past residents of the house . The Good Story ( s ) : Method for Murder-Moving into the mysterious manor to get some peace and quiet while Charles pens his latest masterwork , Horror novelist Charles Hillyer , ( Denholm Elliott ) and his wife Alice , ( Joanna Dunham ) are thrilled with the story , which centers around a serial strangler named Dominic . After a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house , Charles begins to believe that the creation my have come to life and is haunting him and his wife . Probably one of the better entries in the film , it 's easily the creepiest . The atmosphere here is what sets it apart . The scenes with the fictional character are genuinely creepy , the mystery surrounding him is really effective and there 's always a classic creep-out moment . The classic moment is the kill in the psychiatrist 's office , which is an all-time high for creepiness . The build-up to it , with the creaking sounds , quick flashes of a mysterious being , and the thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for this one 's favor . Sweets for the Sweet-Moving into a new house , widower John Reid , ( Christopher Lee ) hires former school teacher Ann Norton , ( Nyree Dawn Porter ) for his young daughter Jane , ( Chloe Franks ) while he 's away on business . Ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from Jane 's past , which John vehemently denies . When she learns the true nature of what has happened , it 's far more shocking that what she could 've thought possible . With the creepiest outright plot and the biggest twist of the stories , this is a quite pleasant entry . The mystery of the family is wonderfully played out , with small amounts of clues piled up here and there , and the final revelation is downright nerve-wracking . That part alone is the main reason why this one works , and Lee doesn't harm it either . The Bad Story ( s ) : Waxwork-Tortured by memories of his lost love , Phillip Grayson , ( Peter Cushing ) and his friend Neville Rogers , ( Joss Ackland ) both become infatuated with a statue of a woman in a Wax Museum , as the statue takes over their lives , they discover a shocking secret about the museum that haunts the both of them . There 's a clever premise here , and it does provide an excuse to spend time in a wax museum , which are always creepy . This is no exception , and it looks eerie , which is helped by the florescent lighting on display on the sculptures . A dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense , but what ultimately kills this one is the slow pace . It takes a long time for events to unfold out , and most of the time is spent on exposition . It also builds up to a shock ending that can be seen coming from a mile away . Those really lower this one a bit . Had the twist been changed , it would 've scored higher , the rest is acceptable . The Cloak-Veteran horror film actor Paul Henderson , ( Jon Pertwee ) upset at the lack of realism on the set of his new film , goes off and buys a new vampire cloak from a specialty store . The cloak soon turns him into a vampire , going crazy on the set with co-star Carla , ( Ingrid Pitt ) and other vampiric acts at home . Unconvinced the cloak is the cause , he does everything he can to prove it 's just in his imagination . This has a pretty decent premise , and there is plenty of opportunity for some decent scares , but what sinks it is several factors . First , it 's just too goofy for it 's own good . The plot twist at the end is a perfect example , which is so overdone that it 's not really a shock at all , and just comes across as just plain silly . There 's so few scenes of scares or attempted scares that it 's just a bore to sit through . It 's the weakest one in the film . The Final Verdict : A quite decent omnibus film , there 's a few small problems scattered through each of the stories that renders this a less than perfect but still highly watchable film . Highly recommended for those into the similar films at the time or who enjoy British horror films . Today 's Rating-PG-13 : Violence  
0	  Bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex . So he buys a van to aid in this quest . The acting is lame , the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clichés and cheap thrills . The makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time , but fell a long way short . They even resort to Bobby slipping on a banana skin , because this will supposedly add comedic value . I 'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film . If you like DeVito , this is another classic DeVito kind of role - but he 's only a supporting actor and there for cliché value .  
0	  I thought " Intensive Care " was quite bad and very unintentionally funny . But at least not as bad as I thought it might be . Sometimes it 's somewhat suspenseful , but never a good shocker . SPOILER AHEAD The fun lies in ridiculous moments . But the all-time classic moment is this : Peter ( Koen Wauters ) is stabbed and beaten by the killer . He lies moaning in the corner of the hallway . Amy ( Nada van Nie ) kneels beside him and asks " Poor Peter , shall I get you a band-aid ? " . This movie was shot in Dutch and English . To spare costs , all license plates are USA , and the background in the news studio is a skyline of Manhattan . Very funny if you 're Dutch and watching the original version in Dutch .  
0	  This movie shows a row of sketches , which partly pass over into one another . I realized the passing over late in the movie , at first it only irritated me . Many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact , using absurdity and obscenity . The attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails . My personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie ( My god , it hurts in my head every time I call it " movie " ) : A bold attempt to turn nothing into something great . But it failed . At least the director made something out of nothing . But it isn't something good . Many movies didn't turn out as funny as they were planned , but this one tops them all . It 's the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making . No . To correct myself , it 's even worse than that . A movie with gags so bad , that they aren't funny at all . It 's not even fun to watch the lead-actor , writer and director ( all three the same guy by the way ) perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies . The movie is too bad for that .  
1	  Although written by Stephen King , an overrated writer if there ever was one , this is actually quite entertaining B-movie . Vampiric , incestuous creatures who live in the candle-lit house and drain the life-force of virgins , great graveyard scenery , heroic cats and very pretty virgin . The soundtrack even has Enya 's music , an idea which I found quite .. nice . I 'm sure King is disappointed to this little movie , although it HAS crappy dialogue and ideas , all of them from a true and tedious King potboiler . ( Albeit Sleepwalkers , if I 'm understood right , is a script without any novel or short story behind it ) . Still , those touches of sewer-odors show he DIDN'T use a ghost-writer after all ..  
1	  I could not take my eyes off this movie when it showed up on cable . The dialogue and costumes are of a quality most readily associated with soft-core porn . In this case the expedient plot serves as a vehicle not for sex but for serial thrashings with nunchuks . ( Perhaps for sex as well , but not on Indian TV , anyway . ) Not being a fan of the genre I couldn't place Jeff Wincott , and had no leads to search from . Only once Brigitte Nielsen traded in her futuristic-nurse coif ( so mayoral ! ) for the high-top fade we remember from Beverly Hills Cop II did I make the positive ID on her . This movie will no doubt entertain any admirer of early 90 's couture or nod-and-wink schlock à la Paul Verhoeven . Can we add a genre tag for " so bad it's good " ?  
0	  Wow probable the worst movie i have ever seen ! This person should never make another movie ! I cant believe anyone would have produce this in good conscience . YOu have have wasted every cent . No concept of real life . I have wasted 2 hours of my life i will never get back . EVER ! Everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed ! I 'm embarrassed for them ! All of you should be ashamed . If i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by 5 years . Please never watch this movie . I have never written a blogg about a film before but The distaste for this film has compelled me to do so .  
0	  I have to admit that by moments I had to laugh at how bad that movie was .. But the laughs were too few and since this whole thing was in no way a parody , it felt more like an insult to the viewer 's intelligence . The worst acting I have ever seen from any of these people ..  
1	  The simple hand camera both gives some almost documentary feeling to this film , and also relates to the dogma films . Did you ever get bored of those hollywood-style cop flicks with brawny guys who get assignments james bond would be envious of ? Fed up with the married-living-single cop , the divorced but family man , the personified doughnut and the tough hunter ? Ever wondered how the real police work is like ? Well , for germany , this film shows you . Set in the north between west germany and east germany , former DDR , an laid off post office clerk starts her job , fresh from policeschool . She quickly finds her way around the usual customers , and becomes accustomed to life as a policewoman .. but this is not much fun . Other german crime films like Derrick , Der Alte et cetera have dignified officers talking calmly with suspects . These cops here have to deal with the lowest on the social ladder . Good dialogue and realism makes this an interesting view , even more if you know that part of germany a bit .  
0	  If he wanted to be accurate , he should have chosen some Frisco natives and not a bunch of NY actors who know nothing about the Sucka Free ( not Sucker Free ) . I 've lived in SF my entire life , and folks here do not talk or act the way these actors did . Everything was over-dramatized , and the only cat I saw from the Bay was JT the Bigga Figga with his little cameo as a rapper . No shock that he was the only one in the film who really dressed like cats out here ( ie his Warriors jersey ) . Not once did I notice anyone wearing any Giants or 9ers gear ; instead he fitted them in some cheesy made-up SF or Oakland jerseys that aren't even sold around here . HP has no bowling alleys , black and Asian gangbangers do NOT wear head or wristbands with the colors of Africa or China 's Olympic team , nor does every Chinese gangster wear a Yao Ming jersey and try and sound black while shooting hoops . Further , while there now is a significant yuppie community that has invaded the Mission , all that was shown was some white dude and a self-proclaimed " 100 % West Coast Boriqua . " This is NOT New York ! Puerto Ricans here are few and far between , and the Latinos in the Mission are very , very different from the ONE that was shown here , who was without a doubt from NY . Also , HP is not the only black neighborhood in the City . An accurate depiction would have shown the drama between HP sets in their own hood as well as vs . Fillmore , Sunnydale , Lakeview , etc . This film could 've been much better if Lee had done some more homework and had a better storyline to work with .  
1	  Monstervision was a show I grew up with . From late night hosting with Penn and Teller to the one , the only , Joe Bob Briggs . The show kept me up Friday nights back in my high school years , and provided some of the best drive-in memories to ever come outside of the drive-in . Without a doubt , the best late night television ever . If you didn't stay up , you were missing out . I know John Bloom and Joe Bob live on , but I want them back where they belong .. MONSTERVISION ! Question .. did anyone else sit through all 4 hours of " The Swarm " ? q :) Long live Monstervision !  
1	  I did not intend to write this review , but having read the default review that shows up on this movie 's URL , I felt compelled to write a rebuttal . The movie in a word is superlative . It does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written . I think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent . In fact , I too was turned off by the excessive show of Evangelist devotions that occupied the middle of the movie to a large extent . However , I must beg to differ with the reviewer in that , this movie in the end is not a propaganda piece for evangelist action . I think , what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers , how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic , simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal platitudes of one kind or another . This does not demonstrate a value judgment on religion as we have to remember that religion is transmuted and expressed by ordinary , mostly well meaning , basically good people and they usually have no monopoly on truth and thus religion can not in the end provide the ultimate answers to some questions in life . Ultimately , it is a matter of faith . You have to take it on faith and that 's all . And if you are given to faith , then you can appreciate any show of faith . And if you are not given to faith then any show of faith is tiresome . It is thus at the same time , instructive to note the reviewer reaction to the movie . In any case , the director shows us that one can choose not to accept the religious interpretation of events and answers to questions and in spite of that life goes on and there are ' secret sunshine ' in this world that awaits all wounded souls , regardless of their religious orientation . And that 's just the core message of the film ! Please note the last scene of the movie , if you don't get this ! In the end , the movie is a great one and very thought provoking and confronts you - the viewer with questions that you have to answer for yourself . Thus it is a work of art that is challenging to you personally . I do agree with the reviewer in that , the Evangelical stuff was a bit too much . However , given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie , I think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called an Evangelist  basher ! The actor Kang-ho Song was great as always . He 's so balanced and just perfect that he 's just amazing . He 's my favorite Korean actor no doubt . I know the actress Do-yeon Jeon got the Cannes award for best actress for this movie . However , I did not find any specialty in her acting . It seems that to get awards you just have to act really convincingly in crying and hysterical scenes and all All in all a great movie . If you don't like it  please watch it again and see if you get it ! If it leaves you dissatisfied or uncomfortable or asking questions then think , if that was not what the director was actually aiming at through this movie in the first place !  
1	  The main reason to see this film is Warren William , who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager . He is electric , constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the biggest disasters . William is a great actor - I feel he never got his due . Bette Davis as his girlfriend also shines in an under-written role . Personally , I found Guy Kibbee not quite right as the lame-brained candidate that William and the others are trying to foist on the public . He seemed more like an empty canvas than a person . I would have preferred to see a real character emerge rather than a non-character . The story itself is implausible , silly and clichéd . But Warren William and Bette Davis are well worth watching .  
1	  Preminger 's adaptation of G. B. Shaw 's ' Saint Joan ' ( screenplay by Graham Greene ) received one of the worst critical reactions in it 's day . It was vilified by the pseudo-elite , the purists and the audiences was unresponsive to a film that lacked the piety and glamour expected of a historical pageant . As in ' Peeping Tom ' , the reaction was malicious and unjustified . Preminger 's adaptation of Shaw 's intellectual exploration of the effects and actions surrounding Joan of Arc ( her actual name in her own language is Jeanne d'Arc but this film is in English ) is totally faithful to the spirit of the original play , not only on the literal emotional level but formally too . His film is a Brechtian examination of the functioning of institutions , the division within and without of various factions all wanting to seize power . As such we are not allowed to identify on an emotional level with any of the characters , including Joan herself . As played by Jean Seberg ( whose subsequent life offers a eerie parallel to her role here ) , she is presented as an innocent , a figure of purity whose very actions and presence reveals the corruption and emptiness in everyone . As such Seberg plays her as both Saint and Madwoman . Her own lack of experience as an actress when she made this film ( which does show up in spots ) conveys the freshness and youth of Jeanne revealing both the fact that Jeanne la Pucelle is a humble illiterate peasant girl who strode out to protect her village and her natural intelligence . By no means did she deserve the harsh criticism that she got on the film 's first release , it 's a performance far beyond the ken and call of any first-time actress with no prior acting experience . Shaw and Preminger took a secular view towards Joan seeing her as a medieval era feminist , not content with being a rustic daughter who 's fate is to be married away or a whore picked up by soldiers to and away from battlefields . Her faith , her voices , her visions which she intermingles with words such as " imagination " and " common sense " leads her to wear the armour of her fellow soldiers to lead them to battle to chase the invading Englishman out of France . And yet it can be said that the film is more interested in the court of the Dauphin ( Richard Widmark ) , the office of the clergy who try Joan led by Pierre Cauchon ( Anton Walbrook , impeccably cast ) and the actions of the Earl of Warwick ( John Gielgud ) then in Joan herself . The superb ensemble cast ( all male ) portray figures of scheming , Machievellian ( although the story precedes Niccolo ) opportunists who treat religion as a childish toy to be used and manipulated for their own ends . The sharp sardonic dialogue gives the actors great fun to let loose . John Gielgud as the eminently rational Earl whose intelligence , ( albeit accompanied by corruption ) , allows him to calculate the precise manner in which he can ensure Joan gets burnt at the stake and Anton Walbrook 's Pierre Cauchon brings a three dimensional portrait to this intelligent theologian who will give Joan the fair trial that will certainly find her guilty . Richard Widmark as the Dauphin is a real revelation . As against-type a casting choice you 'll ever find , Widmark portrays the weak future ruler of France in a frenzied , comic caricature that 's as close as this film comes to comic relief . A comic performance that feels like an imitation of Jerry Lewis far more than an impetuous future ruler of France . Preminger shot ' Saint Joan ' in black and white , the cinematographer is Georges Perinal who worked with Rene Clair and who did ' The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp ' in colour . It 's perfectly restrained to emphasize the rational intellectual atmosphere for this film . Preminger 's preference for tracking shots of long uninterrupted takes is key to the effectiveness of the film , there 's no sense of a wasted movement anywhere in his mise-en-scene . It also marks the direction of Preminger 's most mature ( and most neglected period ) his focus is on the conflict between individuals and the institutions in which they work , how the institution function and how the individual acts as per his principles . These themes get their most direct treatment in his film and as always he keeps things unpredictable and finds no black and white answers . This is one of his very best and most effective films .  
0	  Where do I begin ? I wanted to enjoy this movie , and I did . Still , I wanted to be able to enjoy it for being another zombie film that was worth my loot , and it wasnt . This was a different kind of enjoyment . This was unhealthy , a perverse glee that I partook in watching one of the most ridiculous films Id seen yet . And I dont much care for whatever Fulci 's excuses were , there was no excuse for this film going how it went . This was a bad film all the way around , yet I still cant give it below a 4 out of ten , which is what I gave it , because well .. at least I was able to laugh at this misfit of a movie . I had to imagine these zombies , that were all over the ceilings of these buildings everywhere .. had to imagine that they were either bored as hell so they crawled up on the beems , and perched themselves high on stone erections , or they saw the fleshy living motley band of jerk-offs coming around , so they took it upon themselves to stage numerous aerial ambushes . Hell , what else is there to do when youre dead ? I had to laugh at some zombies performing what looked to be martial arts swings , kicks , and jumps , and some shambling about like traditional meatlovers . I feasted my eyes on a floating head that was never explained . I watched in pure horrific delight as the land they were in , the Phillipenes , was absolutely engulfed in fog , heavy doses of fog , and that the ponds were as they were boiling castle moats . I had to even cringe when I saw that the design for a cure for this plague was sketched on a chalkboard as an octagon with lines stretching from each angle , with " Dead One " written in the middle . I had to ask myself .. if the science of curing zombies is that easy , then I wonder if I could come up with a little something to start a zombie outbreak here ! All in all the effects were overboard , the dubbing horrid , Im sure the original acting as poor , the story absurd , the zombies inconsistent , even in a bad way they couldve all been similar , and the women ugly , but I found myself enjoying this thing . It was a fun watch . It turned out to be a very very bad film , and I would not recommend this thing unless one is into bad directorial exploitation films , but still , again I say .. it was worth a good laugh . I crave zombie films no matter what , but when this had Fulci 's name attached to it , it shouldve been much better . Let me dare say , Zombie Holocaust was better .  
0	  After buying the DVD in a Bargain Bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover , I popped it in the DVD player and everything looked good . Nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra features .. but when I played the movie itself , what a let down . It is the worst thing I have ever seen and I have seen some bad movies in my time . The comment that praises the movie here at IMDB is actually from the people who made the film . So Don't Believe It unless you like to waste your cash !  
0	  Shown in Australia as ' Hydrosphere ' , this incredibly bad movie is SO bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end , just to see if it could get any worse .. and it does ! The storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class , the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures , and the acting is wooden . The infant ' muppet ' seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of ' Total Recall ' . There didn't seem to be a single , original idea in the whole movie . I found this movie to be so bad that I laughed most of the way through . Malcolm McDowell should hang his head in shame . He obviously needed the money !  
1	  Like " My Sassy Girl " , this movie is based on a true story posted from the internet , but that 's where the similarities end . The story is generally about this rebellious guy named Ji-Hoon ( Kwon Sang Woo ) who is still trying to finish high school , whose parents hire a tutor named Su-Wan ( Kim Ha Neul ) , a woman who comes from a poor background , but happens to be the same age as him . Add to that some obstacles , martial arts ( thugs are always after Ji-Hoon for revenge ) , a scorned , thuggish love-sick girl who is after him , his proclivity for ditching the lessons , and you generally can guess the whole story . Did I mention it 's a romantic comedy ? This movie has some good fight scenes , great visual humor and a lot of spunk , thanks to the good chemistry between Kim Ha Nuel and Kwon Sang Woo , that bring a lot of energy to the story . The romantic elements also work because of that reason . And , I must say , I 'd want a girlfriend more like Kim Ha Nuel than that girl from " My Sassy Girl " ( personality-wise , at least ) . She has some spunk , but it 's more on the cute , sweet , good-hearted way . Characters are already mostly likable ( so one might say it had less of a hill to climb than " My Sassy Girl " - an obstacle that worked for that movie to its credit ) , and the movie is quite clever and interesting most of the way . The story kind of sags , though , about 2/3 of the way ( where it sort of treads on familiar , standard fare , where nothing really interesting happens ) , but near the end , it picks up a bit again . Overall , a fun , cute movie . 8/10  
0	  I thought this movie was terrible . I 'm Chinese , so I thought everything was totally wrong . Many of the facts were incorrect . The only thing right about Chinese history in the movie was when Wendy 's mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded ShiHuangDi . I also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake . Many of the actors and actresses were not very great . Some of the jokes that were supposedly " funny " were really stupid . I think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get . Disney has really got to get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie . Mulan was quite accurate . Watch this movie if you want to waste some time .  
1	  Its not Braveheart ( thankfully ) , but it is fine entertainment with engaging characters and good acting all around . I enjoyed this film when it was released and upon viewing it again last week , find it has held up well over time . Not a classic film , but a very fine and watchable movie to enjoy as great entertainment .  
1	  I had seen ' Kalifornia ' before ( must be about 10 years ago ) and I still remember to be very impressed by it . That 's why I wanted to see it again and all I can say is that it still hasn't lost its power , even though I 'm used to a lot more when it comes to movies than that I was ten years ago . ' Kalifornia ' tells the tale of the writer Brian Kessler and his girlfriend Carrie Laughlin , a photographer , who want to move to California . But instead of stepping on a plain and flying right to the state where they say it never rains , they choose to make a trip by car . He wants to write a book about America 's most famous serial killers and she will make the matching pictures . But because their car uses an enormous amount of petrol , they decide to take another couple with them , so they can spread the costs of the trip . Only one couple has answered the add , so they will automatically be the lucky ones . But they haven't met each other yet and when seeing the other couple for the first time , when their trip has already started , Carrie is shocked . Without wanting to be prejudiced , she can only conclude that Early Grayce and Adele Corners are poor white trailer park trash . She definitely doesn't want them in her car , but Brian doesn't really mind to take them with them and decides to stop and pick them up anyway . At first the couple doesn't seem to be that bad after all , but gradually Early Grayce changes from a trashy hillbilly into a remorseless murderer .. Not only is the story very impressive , so is the acting from our four leads . Brad Pitt is incredible as Early Grayce . His performance in this movie may well be his best ever . The same for Juliette Lewis . She plays the childish and naive girlfriend that doesn't want to hear a bad word about her Early and does that really very well . But David Duchovny and Michelle Forbes are a surprise as well . They both did a very good job and I really wonder why we never heard anything from Forbes again since this movie , because she really proves to have a lot of talent . Overall this is a very good and impressive psychological thriller with a very powerful story , but because of the graphic violence , I can imagine that it may not be to everybody 's taste ( although I don't really see another way how to portray a serial killer in a believable way ) . Personally I really liked this movie a lot and the violence never bothered me ( it 's a part of the story that 's too important to be left out ) . I reward this movie with an 8/10 .  
0	  I must be that one guy in America that didn't like this movie . I guess this just wasn't my style or something , I just don't see what 's so fascinating about it , this was * barely entertaining , let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history . It 's about a guy that came from nothing , and goes on to become a drug lord . Pretty simple way to describe an entire movie , and that 's exactly my feeling about the entire movie . Contrary to what a lot of people think , just because a movie is about mafias / drug trade / criminal groups doesn't automatically make it a great movie , don't forget good storytelling .  
1	  Since I watched it for the first time , " Piedras " is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures I actually could watch over and over again . The great screenplay depicts the lives of a bunch of women ( all of them somehow interconnected ) with deep understanding and sensibility . Ramón Salazar achieved a compelling film in his directorial debut , and proves himself as an efficient actors ' director . Not that all performances are excellent , though . Of all leading ladies , they range from average ( Najwa Nimri ) to very good ( Vicky Peña ) , but the standing ovation should be directed to newcomer Mónica Cervera , who convincingly plays Antonia San Juan 's retarded daughter . Enrique Alcides is irresistibly charming as the girl 's male nurse , and there are nice small turns from Andrés Gertrúdix , Geli Albaladejo and the director himself , Ramón Salazar . " Piedras " is beautifully written and filmed , when I watched it I got so moved that I couldn't stop thinking of it for days . I highly recommend it .  
0	  I find myself wondering what the people who gave this a 10 saw in it that I didn't . This movie has a VERY hard time following and / or staying to a plot . If someone tells you it 's a comedy , don't be fooled , it 's about 98 % percent odd-drama and 2 % comedy . All actors turn in a great performance , that cannot be denied , however it seems like it really lost something somewhere . Don't know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what . This had potential , and instead it was really a flop . I would really like the hour and a half I invested in this movie back , but the video rental place doesn't do returns on time . Save your money and see something else .  
0	  OK , I knew this would be a back alley F-film ( well below B-film standards ) going into it , so I thought , " Man , I could use a good laugh , so let 's see some nether-beings kill each other . " Well , what I got could have been found at your local " love toy " store . Random lesbian scenes , very little fighting , and no plot . For example , one scene in particular I remember ( for its sheer stupidity only ; I 've seen better porn on ABC ) is where the two main characters ( I can't remember their names offhand .. great movie , huh ? ) are driving along , as they mostly did , and the driver was tired of driving and stopped : Driver : " Let 's pull over , I 'm tired . You want to take over ? " Passenger : " Sure , I can drive for a while . " ( Once pulled over , the driver starts grabbing the passenger 's boobs ) Passenger : " What are you doing ? I 'm not like that ! " Driver : " It 's OK , everyone does it sometime . " Passenger : " OK then . " ( Proceed to take off shirts , fondle , kiss , and perform fellatio ) Now , last time I checked , horror films were not in the porn section of Hollywood Video ( unless you 're into S & M , then you go elsewhere ) , and it definitely shouldn't be in the mainstream videos at Blockbuster . Don't get me wrong ; I 'm definitely not one of those people who hate porn , but I only watch it when appropriate and definitely don't want to watch it if I 'm looking for a movie in the mainstream stores , as this one I rented was at one of the two retailers I named ( and probably at the other too if I went and looked ) . Worst movie ever , no one should rent it , and it should only be bought for a public burning ceremony . If I could give it a 0 , I would , but I can only give it a * of 10 .  
1	  First , this is a review of the two disc set that came together with the " Wonderland " DVD rental . The two movies included with the rental , " Wonderland " and the Johnny Wadd documentary , totally obliterate the myth created by " Boogie Nights " . That myth being that the characters involved in the adult movie trade were considerably more than slimy lowlifes that would do anything for money , basically denying that they were anything other than detestable self-centered whores . This is amazingly similar to what the book " Wiseguy " and the movie " Goodfellas " did to " The Godfather " fable and most of the rest of the gangster romanticism lore . Now , what irritated me most while watching these movies , and will probably irk anyone who saw and liked " Boogie Nights " , is how foolish and gullible supposedly educated and sophisticated people can be . " Dirk Diggler " in " Boogie Nights " is without a doubt John Holmes , who unlike " Dirk Diggler " , had no redeeming quality . Holmes was a criminal sociopath who abused anyone close to him , was totally consumed by his quest for self-gratification , and was without a doubt a key participant in the brutal murders on Wonderland Avenue in Los Angeles in 1981 . The movie lays bare the big lie that " Boogie Nights " was , and reinforces the Linda Lovelace description of the cruel and pathetic business that is known as the adult film entertainment industry . This should be required viewing , both features on the " Wonderland " DVD , for anyone who had any positive opinions on the story in the movie " Boogie Nights " .  
0	  " Fungicide " is quite possibly the most incompetent , embarrassing , pitiful " film " I have ever seen . The acting is criminal , the direction practically non-existent , and the special effects presumably put together by unleashing a monkey with learning difficulties on a defenceless laptop computer . Far be it from me to stifle creativity , but I actually believe things like this shouldn't be made . I am sure the " film " - makers will say that , yes , the " film " was hampered by a low ( as in nothing ) budget - but in that case they just really shouldn't have bothered . As it is , they have offered the world something so dire , so execrable , that only imbeciles could get the merest shade of enjoyment from it . Starting the " movie " it wasn't as though I was expecting " Citizen Kane " or anything . I was expecting a low budget little horror with perhaps a modicum of inventiveness , a hint of fun , and even some energy . What I got was the cinematic equivalent of a used handkerchief . The plot ? Well , our leering antihero scientist , who works in his parents ' basement , is seen manically stirring some goo in a cup . Apparently , such high-level science is the end-result of years of research . His parents then send him off to a strange hotel-type place in the countryside to relax . There are some other people there , who are simply too awful to write about . Anyway , the scientist drops his test-tube onto some mushrooms - and soon the mushrooms grow and kill some people . ( Wow , I 'm getting suicidal just writing the plot summary ) . Our heroes save the day by detonating a barrel of balsamic vinegar ( by attaching a " fuse " - really a piece of string - to it ) . The barrel unaccountably explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon , destroying all the mushrooms . The end . ( Thank goodness ) . That summary is as good as the " film " gets ( and actually makes it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is ) . It really should never have got past this stage of development ( by which I mean a plot outline scribbled on the back of an envelope with crayons ) . Somebody should have really stepped in and given someone a vigorous shake and said " NO . " And those " special " effects . Well , they 're " special " all right . This is CGI gone crazy . And done by a person who I can only assume believes the bicycle pump to be the pinnacle of modern technology . And when the mushroom monsters are not in the style of a 1984 home computer graphics package , they are represented by actors shuffling along covered in a sheet ( I kid you not ) . One of the most inexcusable things about the movie is its laziness . This can be summed up by the scene in which the hero spins his guns ( a la Clint Eastwood ) and then fails miserably to get them in his pockets . I mean come on , a couple of retakes and he could have pulled it off , but just to leave it as it is - really weak . I cannot believe money was spent on this camcorder-shot rubbish . The " film " - makers should hang their heads in shame and be banned from going within fifty metres of any movie-making equipment . I also think it 's wrong that friends and family of the makers come onto IMDb and post mendacious reviews and give stupidly high user ratings which give a totally inaccurate picture of the " movie . " " Fungicide " is an absolute travesty of film-making . Mr Wascavage is either very , very stupid or very , very cynical .  
1	  This one 's a romp ; many Trek fans don't rate this as high as the well-known all-time classic episodes because it lacks the deep meaning or undertone of those really great ones , but this one is so well executed for what it is , so successful as pure entertainment , it always makes my personal list of the top half dozen episodes , no matter what mood I 'm in . Several well known future movies ( " Westworld " ) and TV shows ( the more bland " Fantasy Island " ) took their cue from the premise of this episode ( then , of course , the TNG show revamped the concept with the holodeck technology ) . Beautifully filmed ( especially evident in the restored version and on DVD ) and directed , it takes place in the nice park-like setting of a planet which the Enterprise has just arrived to . It 's odd that no animal life , even insects , seems to exist here ( how are flowers pollinated , for example ) , but things turn really odd when members of the landing party start seeing people from their past ( Kirk has a people-heavy past , it turns out ) , as well as figures from other well-known fantasy stories . Sulu even finds an old-style police revolver ( adding to his collection of swords , no doubt ) . By this point in the Trek series ( halfway thru the first season ) , the main characters had pretty much solidified into the old friends we 'd come to know over the many proceeding years . Here , we get to really see them relax , converse and work together to figure out this episode 's puzzle : the strong narrative is a mystery again , of sorts , and the audience is along for the ride as Kirk & friends seek to unravel a very bizarre series of events which have a decidedly amusing flavor to them . It 's almost whimsical , following up on the carefree style established up on the starship as Kirk was finally maneuvered into beaming down after showing definite signs of stress and fatigue ( the Enterprise had , it 's suggested , just completed a harrowing mission ) . Then Dr. McCoy is killed by a knight on horseback ; yes , this is Dr. McCoy 's final episode .. just kidding . But , it 's no joke to the rest of the landing party at this point in the story . McCoy really is dead for all intents and purposes and , like the best Trek episodes , the 2nd half of this adventure escalates to a more frantic , more desperate tempo of action and suspense . This is all signaled by Kirk 's resolute response to Sulu , who voices his lack of understanding about any of these events just after McCoy 's death - Kirk will get to the bottom of all this , come what may . But , it doesn't get much easier for Kirk : what follows is probably the longest staged mano-a-mano fight for the series as Kirk tussles with his nemesis from his academy days , a struggle that seems to take place over half the planet . Yet , this is counterbalanced by scenes of extraordinary tenderness , with another of Kirk 's past acquaintances . This episode runs the gamut of all human experience , rather fitting in light of what we learn about the actual purpose of this weird planet . It 's gratifying that the script really does explain all of what 's happened , as opposed to some nonsensical approach which permeates many other fantasy & sci-fi series with similar plot lines ( unexplained appearances by persons who could not possibly be there ) . And there actually is a subtext to the story - that we humans need to ' work ' off our tensions and fatigue in a particular fashion , or we just don't function in a ' normal ' natural way . Also , note the appearance of the very cute Yeoman Barrows and the sudden absence of Yeoman Rand , who did not return until the first Trek movie in ' 79 . I believe that after this episode , even more Trek fans couldn't wait for the next appearance of all their favorite characters . But I leave this episode with a final , perhaps tantalizing thought : if McCoy was killed ( verified by Spock ) , how do we know it was our real McCoy who beamed back up to the ship ? Perhaps this explains why this McCoy was still inspecting starships about a century later and getting along very well with Data .  
0	  may contain spoilers ! so i watched this movie last night on LMN ( Lifetime Movie Network ) which is NOT known for showing quality movies . THIS MOVIE IS AWFUL ! i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing , as it was terrible . could this movie contain any more stereotypes ? ( harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor , catholic family with priest sons , big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic family 's house , mexican whores , " bad " guy who is really a softie at heart , incredibly bad country accents ) GAG ! i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it , i decided to stay awake until 4am to watch it . anyway , the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amick 's beauty . i suppose pollack 's and nemec 's acting is okay , but they have a horrid script to work with . unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents ( the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang ) i think that the accents were there ( in supporting characters like mary margaret 's date and john ) and were unnecessary . they were also very very bad . i am so very tired of hollywood " southern " accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from . and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive , i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town : the beautiful capitol building , the UT tower lit up for a winning football game , etc . none of these things were there . also , it takes about 5-6 hours to drive to mexico from austin . at one point in the movie , michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark ( during the summer and early fall it doesn't get dark in austin until 9pm or so ) , spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican ( is there any other kind ? ) whores , and then return to austin by dawn . while this is theoretically possible it is NOT very likely . and if anyone has started school in the hill country ( usually the third week of august , but may have been in september in 1960 ) they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they DO NOT wear their letter jackets ! in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90 + degrees . only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school . all in all , a very bad made for tv movie experience .  
1	  Written and directed by Steve Gordon . Running time : 97 minutes . Classified PG . It was the quintessential comedy of the decade . It won Sir John Gielgud the Academy Award . It was even featured in VH1 's " I Love the 80 's . " And it looks just as good today as it did upon it 's initial release . Arthur is the acclaimed comedy classic about a drunken millionaire ( played with enthusiasm and wit by Dudley Moore in an Oscar-nominated performance ) who must choose between the woman he loves and the life he 's grown accustomed to . While the basic plot is one big cliche , there 's nothing trite about this congenial combination of clever dialogue and hilarious farce . Arthur Bach is essentially nothing more than a pretentious jerk , but you can't help but like him . Especially when he delivers lines such as , " Don't you wish you were me ? I know I do ! " He 's also a delineation from the archetypical movie hero : unlike most wealthy characters we see on the silver screen , he 's not ashamed of being filthy rich . In one scene , a man asks him , " What does it feel like to have all that money ? , " to which he responds , " It feels great . " Moore lends such charisma and charm to a character that would otherwise be loathed by his audience . And Gielgud is simply perfect as the arrogant servant , addressing his master with extreme condescension in spite of the fact that his salary depends on him . Arthur is one of those movies that doesn't try to be brilliant or particularly exceptional : it just comes naturally . The screenplay - which also earned a nod from the Academy - is saturated with authentic laugh-out-loud dialogue . This is the kind of movie that , when together with a bunch of poker buddies , you quote endlessly to one another . It also looks at its characters with sincere empathy . There have been a number of comedies that attempt to dip into drama by including the death or illness of a principal star ( including both Grumpy Old Men 's ) , but few can carry it off because we just don't care . When this movie makes the dubious decision to knock off the butler , it actually works , because we genuinely like these people . Why should you see Arthur ? The answer is simple : because it 's an all-around , non-guilty pleasure . At a period in which films are becoming more and more serious , Arthur reminds us what it feels like to go to the movies and just have a good time . * - Classic  
0	  This woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling . So she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer . This movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope . The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds , someone is snorting heroin . If they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin , then this would be a pretty good movie . Every time I thought that a scene was going somewhere , someone inhaled the white powder . It was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie . It pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer . The lesbian stuff didn't bother me . I was looking for a movie about art . I found a movie about drug use .  
1	  I 'm far from a Sylvester Stallone fan and I guess the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3 , which is an almost inexistent small role . And yet I must admit that this movie was actually not that bad , even though I feared the worst . When Gabe ( Stallone ) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top , he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger . For almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve , but than he returns . Soon after he 's back , they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm . At least , that 's what the rangers believe . In reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed . The cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them .. This is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever , but in its genre it 's an enjoyable one . I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers . I know him best from the TV-series " 3rd Rock from the Sun " , but I enjoyed his performance in this movie as well . Overall the acting is OK , it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one-liners , but it also offered a very nice decor . This movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment . I loved the snowy mountains and valleys , the mountain rivers and the forests .. Perhaps that 's why I give this movie a score higher than what I normally give to an action / adventure movie of this kind . I give it a 6.5/10 . If you don't expect too much , this is an enjoyable movie .  
1	  This movie has several things going for it . It is a " feel good " story . The characters and actors are likable , realistic and present fine performances . Most important , I believe , is that Dennis Quaid knows how to grip and throw a baseball . Robert Redford looked good both throwing and swinging a bat in " The Natural , and so did Kevin Costner in " For Love of the Game " and " Bull Durham . " In " Major League , " Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen looked like they knew what they were doing , but many of the others did not , and that picture was pure silliness - and not very funny . So many earlier baseball movies , even where the stories might be interesting , presented such a lack of baseball ability on the part of the leads , they were ludicrous in this respect . In " The Stratton Story " and " Strategic Air Command , " Jimmy Stewart looked about as believable as a professional baseball player , as your overweight , non-athletic , elderly uncle in the softball game at the family reunion . Other virile and physically robust stars ( e.g. , Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig ; Robald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander ; and Dan Dailey as Dizzy Dean ) also exhibited a degree of baseball ability that would put them in the late rounds while " choosing-up " for a game at the Sunday picnic ( even if coed , and even if your uncle were involved ) . The scenes of Quaid 's high school team he coached , the ones where he attends his tryout with the Devil Rays , and those with him playing in two minor leagues and in the American League , all ring true . The participants are believable and capable . In addition , he is an engaging actor who always delivers a talented and appropriate characterization ( except , to a degree , some of his " over-the-top " scenes , and his forced accent , in his portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis ) . But he 's definitely on-target here , and this movie is a " 9 , " as good , or better , as any others of this genre , except for " The Natural . "  
1	  Don't look for an overdeveloped plotline here .. just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one . A gallery of stars pop up as the classic cartoon character 's villains in this live action comedy , which features incredible makeup and set design , not to mention knockout performances from Beatty , Madonna , and Pacino . Great fun for kids and adults alike . * out of *  
1	  There are very few movies that are so funny as this one . I was lucky enough to watch this movie at a theater " reserved " for movie buffs like me , so it was not so embarrassing sitting there laughing till my jaw was completely sore and my shirt sleeves were all wet from drying my eyes .. At times the story was a bit " slow " , but that is perhaps for the best - a bit of rest in-between the rolling amongst the aisles ( I nearly fell out of the seat .. ) was most welcome .  
0	  Previous comment made me write this . It says that Muslims are blonde and Serbs are dark ( because our blood is mixed ) . This comment just says that this opinion can be made by racist . Look , race is nothing . I 'm color blind . I look like Pierce Brosnan but I 'm no Irish . So what ? I might add that I am not 100 % Serb , that I have some Austrian and Croat blood within me but whats the point . I 'm dark , half-breed ? Is that so ? Anyone using racial prejudices with such bad intent like Lantos ( producer9and director is racist for me . Karadzhic , Izetbegovich , Milosevic , Tudjman they are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life , my family , my country , Yuggoslavia . Hope they will be all in hell but that wont return our dead relatives back . I am proud of being Serb and I am proud of my cousins , Austrians , Croats , Muslims , Hungarians , Arabs ( yes I am from Serbia and I have multiethnical family ) . This movie doesn't show sufferings of Serbs or Croats within Sarayevo , terrible terrorism of street gangs , Muslim extremism . I add : I kneel and pray for all innocent sisters and brothers Muslim , catholic or orthodox , killed in this war . This film is manipulation with our misery , false humanitarianism 's which doesn't help at all . It helps Lantos to fill his pockets with more doe , alright !  
1	  I don't know much about the Rat Pack , and Frank Sinatra always seemed a bit too self-consciously full of himself to me . So when I call this one of my all-time faves , it 's nothing to do with a tribute-band mentality . As another reviewer says , Mad Dog Time is about symbolism , not realism . It 's kafkaesque ( a pity Kyle MacLachlan is probably the weakest of a very strong crowd , when he was so good as Josef K ) , it 's stylish , knowing , sardonic and slick . Jeff Goldblum is navigating his way around a variety of characters , trying not to get shot and acting deftly rather than dorkily , trying to stay abreast of what he knows and others don't , whom he can outshoot and whom he can't . Gabriel Byrne and Richard Dreyfuss ( his best performance ) have a ball , and the supporting cast look spot-on . The symbolism , the settings ( the one outdoor motion shot with Jeff Goldblum walking down the steps seems really weird after so much lounge lizardry ) , the dialogue ( style , not practicality , is the order of the day ) , it 's all about characters interacting , not really gangsterism . Fun to watch , must 've been fun to do . What the critics were up to is really a mystery ..  
1	  this movie is another on the list that i did not want to see . i was talked into it and dragged into the theater , but boy am i glad for that . i thought it was going to be just another love story , but it turns out to be SOO much more than that . definatly an intellectual flick , one of those movies you have to pay attention to .  
1	  This version of Bleak House is the best adaptation of a classic novel known to me . The representation of the court of Chancery as a ' character ' in the drama is magnificent . The acting is marvellous , from the sinister Tulkinghorn , to the Dedlocks , Smallweed , Crooke , Miss Flyte , and the two young lovers . But it is the spider 's web of chancery that holds the whole thing together , and the cinematography is superb . What mistake did the BBC make about copyright that meant that this version could not be seen in the UK on either video or DVD for many years ? I tried to find out from them , but faced a stone wall . In the end I got a DVD copy from Canada .  
0	  It SURPRISINGLY had a plot ! ;) I 've seen movies with less plot ( I don't wanna mention Asian movies but .. ) . I thought the camera wasn't bad at all for a cheap movie like this , and also the atmosphere wasn't too bad . There is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens . Although I do think that about a lot of movies , in this case it was horrible , of course . It ripped off some movies SO badly just for single scenes . The acting was bad but I 've seen worse . The movie was bad but I 've seen worse . Watching this film is an experience between boredom , laughing fits , death wish , sadism , horniness and entertainment on a low level . So if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you . I gave it 3/10 , because it CAN be entertaining if you don't expect to see a good movie and you 're in the right mood .  
0	  You might be tempted to rent this film because Peter Sellers appears in it . That would be a mistake . This is one of the most pointless films ever made . I kept waiting for something funny to happen , but nothing funny appears in this movie . Even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and didn't even try to promote it . Its a wonder that it was ever put on video . I wonder what sort of contract caused Sellers to be in this film . I also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to go on to make other bad films . Surely this film is a waste of the money used to create it , and a waste of anyone 's time watching it . Surely there are high school students who would be able to write / produce a film which as a plot .  
0	  I am a huge fan of David Lynch . This film , however , was a quite disappointing experience . Apart from the ambient background music  which really sets the mood of the film  it lacks almost all the qualities that I 've come to associate with Lynch 's work . The visuals are dull , to say the least , and the dialog is to vague and monotone to be of any interest . This feels more like a film students awkward try to do an arty dogma movie than the work of an experienced director . I 've seen a lot of amateur movies with far superior camera-work , scenery , sound and script . This film lacks almost all artistic qualities . I feel as though I 'm watching one of Davids home videos , produced during a weekend trip with some friends .  
1	  This stirring western spins the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by one and all . James Stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized Winchester in a shootout , only to lose it in a robbery . The story details Stewart 's pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film . The rifle changes hands time after time , as though the owner is fated to lose it through violence . The picture has plenty of action and suspense as Stewart closes in on his quarry . A great cast supports Stewart here , namely Stephen McNally , Dan Duryea , Millard Mitchell , John McIntire and Jay C. Flippen . Shelley Winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure . Tony Curtis and Rock Hudson , teen heartthrobs in later years , have brief but good roles .  
1	  I LOVE this movie ! Beautifully funny and utterly believable characters . Each scene richer and more wonderful than the last . Every aspect of this movie is filled with wit and humour and love and depth . A complex and engrossing story , too . This movie is filled with love , humour , and intelligence . Totally great !  
0	  Despite the ( English ) title , this seems to have little to do with Devils and much more to do with a power hungry ruler who seeks the Philospher 's Stone & wants gold made from lead ( & virgin 's blood ) . Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little issue with having people put to death when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood . He 's basically egged on by his lady love and an alchemist that he 's employed and it 's more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession ( unfortunately ) . There are parts that are at least somewhat exciting like jousting and grown men trying to knock each other down with big sticks , and the film at least has a good look to it , but otherwise there 's little about this to recommend . Little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all , and most unusual , for a Molina / Naschy film , not really any unintentional humor . Therefore , 4 out of 10 .  
0	  Very rarely do I give less rave reviews on a show or film I dislike on IMDb , but Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful , it 's terrible . I wouldn't have minded if this had been an animated series - would 've been better that way I guess , but as a live-action show , it typifies the terms ' cheesy ' and ' campy ' . Of which Power Rangers is . Five multi - coloured , spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills . The costumes are horrid - they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear . The acting is woeful , and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch , it makes Jean - Claude Van Damme , look as equally as good as Bruce Lee , which is an understatement in itself . In fact , they look as if they are jumping and dancing about ; like it was some version of the ' Nutcracker ' , or they were doing ballet , rather than fighting . Besides , there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun-yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly . Kids show or not , this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity . And even though this version is set in America , you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the US , but rather in Japan ; thus the somewhat ' fake ' fighting and footage was borrowed from the Japanese version-only to be juxtaposed onto the US version . If you like this type of thing , then stick with Sentai - the Japanese equivalent .  
1	  I have previously seen Zu : Warriors from the Magic Mountain . In that film , the setting takes place in China 's mountains , the Legend of Zu looks like another dimension ! Thank that to Tsui Hark 's extensive use of CGI effects . He 's able to portray his vision of mountains floating above the clouds , a land where beings fly freely , and powers ranging from razor sharp wing blades , split swords , and the ultra cool Moon Orb . While there are many characters in this one , the focus is mainly on King Sky and Enigma . The romance aspect is there , although the movie seems much darker than its predecessor . Cecilia Cheung is beautiful and her presence on screen makes this movie worth watching . In the beginning , I like how she resembles the Countess ( from Zu Warriors ) and she does well playing Enigma as she deals with facing her past life . Oh , by the way , did I mention that Cecilia 's very appealing to the eye ? In truth , Zu Warriors had more comedy elements and its special effects were limited due to its time in 1983 . Tsui Hark takes it to a whole new level and sets a new standard in cinema .  
1	  This movie is really genuine and random . It 's really hard to find movies like it in bunches of movies now in Hollywood . I really enjoy watching this movie , i bought its DVD Tuesday this week and i 've watched it for 4 times . I love the Spanglish accent of Paz , it s just really cute as she is . And her acting and Morgan 's are so funny and natural . My movie taste might be really different from others but i have to say i really love this movie , the simple is the best ! I 've learned something more about life from this movie ( well , or at least USA 's life ) .. life is really random .. Sometimes , u meet someone , they pass by your life and be your friends coincidently , and u don't spend so much time with them , maybe just a while but u enjoy that ' while ' with them , and then u and them will never meet each other again , but the time u are together is really unforgettable . Just keep those moments in your mind as grateful and nice memories .. This movie might be cheap in the making price but its meanings are totally not cheap . I rarely can learn anything from movies , but this is an exception .  
1	  First things first , the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed . Now actress Wang Zu Xian , the one who played Xiao Qian in the movie , is 42 years old and well aged . It 's always good to review these glorious times when seeing old-school HongKong productions like this . The movie is one of the most influential titles made in 1980s . The art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing . More fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it . It feels like a horror movie but ultimately it 's not scaring , but only fun . I had the experience of translating the second script of " A Chinese Ghotst Story " , and I thought that script was a decent write . However when I saw the movie , I firstly was disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script , like in a smaller scale and involving more comic roles . However , it turned out to be better executed in terms of being entertaining . If you have seen the Lord of the Rings , you will notice the similarities in this movie to LOTR . The climax is like a mirror of Miranda Otto fighting with the Ring Witch . It 's definitely a laugh-out-loud . Bravo !  
0	  It was interesting to see how accurate the writing was on the geek buzz words , yet very naive on the corporate world . The Justice Department would catch more of the big corp giants if they did such naive things to win . The real corporate world is much more subtle and interesting , yet every bit as sinister . I seriously doubt ANY corp would actually kill someone directly ; even the mod is more indirect these days . In the real world , they do kill people with nicotine , pollution , additives , poisons , etc . This movie must have been developed by some garage geeks , I think , and the studios didn't know the difference . They just wanted something to capitalize on the Microsoft antitrust case in the news .  
1	  One of the finest pieces of television drama of the last decade . Throughout the five hours , ones perceptions and sympathies are constantly challenged as it explores many facets of modern day British society . David Morrisey is , as usual , brilliant . At first coming across as a heavy handed copper in conflict with the heroine , but then proving to be intelligent and caring , as he works with her in uncovering the truth . I have never seen Surrane Jones before . I believe she comes from the world of television soaps . Her performance was magnificent , as she maintains her humour and composure whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother . I could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this magnificent drama , but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenges your assumptions about any of the characters . It is programmes like this that restore one 's faith in television drama , whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the airwaves .  
1	  The Lady From Shanghai is weird even by the standards of its eminent director , Orson Welles , whose last Hollywood film this was for many a moon . It 's a kind of post-modern film noir made during the period when more conventional films of this type were quite popular , and it concerns a happy go lucky Irish sailor ( played by Welles ) who falls in with a mysterious lady ( Rita Hayworth , who was married to Welles at the time ) , and her crippled , and probably impotent husband , played with a brainy , malevolent gusto by Everett Sloan . A long sea voyage follows , with Welles in tow as bodyguard , and the plot thickens when Sloan 's law partner ( Glenn Anders ) turns up and starts making trouble by giving odd speeches about suicide and other morbid topics that suggest that the man is on the verge of mental breakdown . A murder plot ensues , and all sorts of calamities follow for Welles and his employers , and at this point the story , fuzzy and told at a leisurely pace thus far , goes off the deep end , and the last part of the film consists of brilliant directorial set-pieces that seem to have been thrown in to give the movie some of the drive and urgency its story does not , by itself , possess , and the result is a very watchable and often pleasing at all times incomprehensible mess . It 's hard to know what Welles was trying to do with this film aside from maybe resurrect his career in Hollywood by making a vehicle for his wife . But self-destruction intervenes , as it often does with Welles , and Miss Hayworth has never looked less fetching . That she is also cast as a femme fatale seems peculiar , as aside from her beauty her most appealing trait as a screen personality was lovableness , a quality she does not possess in this picture . The director himself is strangely unappealing and hammy at O'Hara , the ( presumably ) easygoing sailor , since Welles , for all his many gifts , was not known as an easy man to work with . This is a role that twenty or thirty years later Sean Connery or Robert Shaw might have been able to breath life into . Welles does not . The most interesting performance in the movie is Glenn Anders ' as Grisby , Sloan 's loony , treacherous law partner . Anders works wonders with the part , and is photographed to look bizarre , while his scenes end on odd , sour notes , and are often choppily edited ; but for all this he manages to make Grisby 's derangement palpable and disturbing , and anticipates , in a genteel way , the more flamboyant Method actors of the fifties , such as Timothy Carey . There is a question that nags me about this film : what was Welles trying to say ? He was a highly talented and intelligent man , and tended to make statements in his movies , which , whether one agrees with his world view or not , were brilliantly put forth . I think I have an answer , or a partial one : Welles was summing up his movie career . He had reached the end of his rope in the Hollywood studio system he despised , and he knew it . The Lady From Shanghai isn't exactly a nose-thumbing at the studio moguls of the day , but I suspect that it is , in its portrait of amoral , rival big shot lawyers ( read : producers ) expressing Welles ' opinion of the power brokers of Hollywood . That he presented himself as a rootless sailor is telling . Welles himself was certainly an inveterate traveler , and he rarely lived in one place for long . He was hired by a studio to provide it with a big , prestigious film ( Citizen Kane ) , which caused a firestorm of controversy from which he never fully recovered . This may be the issue that dares not speak its name in this film , which is to say Welles ' personal failure in not getting over the shock of his newness in the movie colony , and his inability to deliver the goods , as promised . The mere fact of him turning up in Hollywood , like his mere presence in the film , could not forestall disasters well beyond his control . That he presented himself in the movie as an amiable , naive outsider shows a lack of self-knowledge on Welles ' part . He was much more of an inside player than he let on , and I imagine that he despised his knowledge of the worldlier aspects of life , and himself for knowing so much .  
1	  This is a great little film , that 's very unique , and creative , with some great plot twists and wonderful performances ! . All the characters are great , and the story while bizarre , is fascinating and very interesting , plus Nicole Kidman is simply amazing in this ! . It 's very hard to describe this movie , because it really is quite bizarre , it 's a comedy / romance , one minute then it turns into a thriller the next , however it was still very entertaining all the same , plus Nicole 's Russian accent was fantastic , and extremely convincing . Chaplin and Kidman had very good chemistry together , and i loved Vincent Cassel 's performance ! , plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise ! . The ending was very cute , and it 's unpredictable throughout ! , plus this movie is quite underrated as well ! . You will feel sorry for Chaplin and the way that he is scammed , and i thought all the characters were really likable , plus the finale is especially good . This is Nicole 's movie though , and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance ! . This is a great little film , that 's very unique , and creative , with some great plot twists and wonderful performances ! , i highly recommend this one ! . The Direction is very good ! . Jez Butterworth does a very good job here , with great camera work , solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace ! . The Acting is wonderful ! . Nicole Kidman , is stunningly gorgeous ! , and is amazing as always , she is incredibly sexy , very likable , had one of the coolest accents , added a lot of presence , had very good chemistry with Ben Chaplin , and had a very mysterious character ! , she was amazing . ( Kidman Rules ! ) . Ben Chaplin is great here , he is extremely likable , had a cool character , had very good chemistry with Kidman , the only thing i didn't like was him taking out his anger out on Kidman , even though what she did was wrong , and i loved how he got revenge in the end ! . Vincent Cassel is fantastic as the main villain , yes he was OTT , but he was very intense and quite creepy at times , this role was perfect for him . Mathieu Kassovitz is OK here , but didn't have much to do . Rest of the cast are fine . Overall i highly recommend this one ! . * 1/2 out of 5  
1	  well i was a teenager when i saw the movie .. the songs were a huge hit but the elite class skipped govinda movies back then coz watching govinda and karishma ( aka karizma ) movies were not the in thing for that ' class ' but anyways a lot of people liked it as the series of these movies rocked the 90 's through out and most of them were successful .. today i was watching it again after a long time and i remembered , there was a long que of people and the riot they created when the a aa e uo uo o song came on screen .. the dresses of govinda and karishma were complimentary to each other ( the worst dressing duo of that time ) well karisma in the late 90 's transformed but govinda has still been very faithful to his designer as his dress sense remains the same .. but back then it all blended it was all good .. everything worked and slowly the elite class realized what fun it was missing and then .. there was no looking back for this jodi as it went on n on making those Indian carry on series .. hated by a few but loved by the masses . if you are looking for a good time with nothing to do rent it or watch it on TV i don't think you will regret it .. but remember its the worst at its best .. still i watch those movies when i get time coz i cant stop laughing .. so i say go ahead and have a good time as there are times when we all love stupidity and specially when its done by the kings of their times it surely is watchable .. i recommend it to all movie lovers ..  
1	  If you didn't enjoy this movie , either your dead , or you hate Adam Sandler or Don Cheadle . An Excellent cast , all of who gave good performances . This movie proved that Adam Sandler is good actor , despite what critics say . Adam Sandler is becoming a very well respected actor . It all started with his performance in Big Daddy , then he did a couple bad movies , then he broke through with terrific performance in 50 First Dates , The Longest Yard , then Click , and now Reign Over Me . Back to the movie . Adam Sandler plays a man who has lost everything . The closest thing to family he has are a mother-in-law and father-in-law . After his old college roommate ( Cheadle ) ran into him , he seems to turn his life around . I will say no more , because I do not want to ruin the movie , but I strongly recommend this movie . One of the best movies of 2007 .  
0	  The Three Stooges in a feature length western comedy-musical ? Perhaps " Rockin ' in the Rockies " was meant to combine the Stooges comedy short with the western musical , in a matinée ; if so , this was a pleasant way to break up a Saturday afternoon . Jay Kirby ( as Rusty ) is a handsome young hero ; and , Mary Beth Hughes ( as the blonde June ) and Gladys Blake ( as the brunette Betty ) are pretty women . The Hoosier Hotshots are a harmonious group ; their songs are quite tuneful ; however , this is the 1940s , not the 1950s , so the film doesn't exactly " rock " . There are a few laughs ; but the Stooges ' brand of humor is more subdued than usual . The talking horse is also underutilized . * Rockin ' in the Rockies ( 4/17/45 ) Vernon Keays ~ Moe Howard , Larry Fine , Curly Howard , Mary Beth Hughes  
0	  The Class is a comedy series that portrays a bunch of 27-year-old former class mates . I like the idea of the show . That 's why it saddens me that The Class is not funny , even though it has the obvious potential . It 's not enough corky , just dorky . ( Haha . ) This is due to a slowish tempo and the lack of actually hilarious punch lines . Also some actors have difficulties with timing . Most inventively written characters are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler ( Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh ) but even they seem just a little too square for the good of the show . On the other hand the characters I find most uninteresting are the main character Ethan and the used-to-be - couple Duncan and Nicole . What bothers me with the series is that the only Latino character Aaron is being picked on for his accent ( even though by a non-respectable character , but anyway ) .  
1	  This film never received the attention it deserved , although this is one of the finest pieces of ensemble acting , and one of the most realistic stories I have seen on screen . Clearly filmed on a small budget in a real V.A. Hospital , the center of the story is Joel , very well-played by Eric Stoltz . Joel has been paralyzed in a motorcycle accident , and comes to the hospital to a ward with other men who have spinal injuries . Joel is in love with Anna , his married lover , played by Helen Hunt , who shows early signs of her later Academy-Award winning work . Although the Joel-Anna relationship is the basic focus , there are many other well-developed characters in the ward . Wesley Snipes does a tremendous job as the angry Raymond . Even more impressive is William Forsythe as the bitter and racist Bloss . I think Forsythe 's two best scenes are when he becomes frustrated and angry at the square dancers , and , later , when he feels empathy for a young Korean man who has been shot in a liquor store hold up . My favorite scene with Snipes is the in the roundtable discussion of post-injury sexual options . The chemistry between Stoltz and Hunt is very strong , and they have two very intimate , but not gratuitous , sex scenes . The orgasm in the ward is both sexy and amusing . There is also another memorable scene where Joel and Bloss and the Korean boy take the specially-equipped van to the strip bar . It 's truly a comedy of errors as they make their feeble attempts to get the van going to see the " naked ladies . " The story is made even more poignant by the fact that the director , Neal Jimenez , is paralyzed in real life . This is basically his story . This film is real , not glossy or flashy . To have the amount of talent in a film of such a small budget is amazing . I recommend this film to everyone I see , because it is one of those films that even improves on a second look . It 's a shame that such a great piece of work gets overlooked , but through video , perhaps it can get the attention it so richly deserves .  
1	  I feel Monarch Cove was one of the best written and acted out " Drama " Series to come on any Network in a long time . This show had great potential and I couldn't wait to view it each week . This could be developed into a great Primetime Soap . People look forward to this type of acting as we are being " Reality TV " overkilled . I long for the type of writing and acting that shows like Dallas , Knots ' Landing , Dynasty , MelRose Place , etc . provided . Monarch Cove updated this concept quite well and I anticipated it only getting better . There 's so much to expand on with these characters and they were all very interesting and captivating in their own right . It would be a loss to not explore this and develop these characters after having drawn and hooked us into their world . I absolutely loved this show because it was mysterious , interesting and sensuous without going overboard or offending . Loved It .  
1	  My husband and I enjoy The DoodleBops as much as our 8 month old baby does . We have bought him DVD 's and CD 's just so we can watch and listen to them ourselves . They are fun , energetic , and very entertaining . They encourage children to be active , share and care . They always have a positive message along with fun entertainment . Every time our son hears the theme song he quickly turns his head toward the television and starts bouncing up and down in excitement . Dee Dee is a wonderful singer , she has a great voice . Moe is a great dancer . I would recommend The DoodleBops to anyone with children . Our favorite song is The Bird Song . You just can not help but smile and want to dance when you hear it .  
1	  The Plainsman is an entertaining western , no doubt a classic , which is actual even today . Gary Cooper is Wild Bill Hickok , ideal for the role , together with John Wayne and James Stewart , they were the best actors that played western heroes in their generation . Jean Arthur is great as Calamity Jane , nobody that I know played it better than her . Even if might not be historically accurate , the film manages to capture the most important about Hickok and about the time it takes place . Sometimes you have to sacrifice History to make your point and that is what DeMille does here . The friendship of Hickok with Buffalo Bill , the selling of rifles to the Indians by a great manufacturer to compensate for the losses he would have because of the end of the civil war , Custer and Little Big Horn , the uneasy relationship between Buffalo Bill 's wife , a religious woman , with Hickok a man who had killed plenty , also the unusual love affair between Hickok and Calamity all this makes ' The Plainsman ' a non conventional and interesting film . Anthony Quinn has a very short appearance , that already shows what a great actor he was going to become . A lot of care was taken to show the original guns of that time .  
1	  Playwright Sidney Bruhl ( Michael Caine ) has had a series of flop plays after a huge hit . He receives a play written by a student of his , Clifford Anderson ( Christopher Reeve ) which is fantastic . It 's so good Sidney says he would kill for it . Will he ? A thinking man 's thriller . It was originally a play .. and it shows . It 's mostly on one set and all talk but I was never bored . It 's very well-written with plenty of twists and a good cast working full force . Caine is just great as Bruhl-another one of his great performances . Reeve is , surprisingly , very good . I never thought much of him as an actor , but he 's really good in this role . Dyan Cannon does wonders with an underwritten role as Bruhls ' wife . Irene Worth is also good ( and quite funny ) as Helga ten Drop , a psychic . However , her accent did get on my nerves . Director Sidney Lumet does very well with his one set . The camera is always moving and keeps your attention going . EXTREME SPOILER DEAD AHEAD ! My only complaint is that two gay characters in this movie turn out to be raging sociopaths and it also contains one of the most unromantic kisses I 've ever seen-but these are mild complaints . A very good thriller . Critics hate this movie ( for some reason ) and it seems to have completely disappeared since it premiered in 1982 . That 's too bad-it deserves better .  
0	  Polyester was the very first John Water 's film I saw , and I have to say that it was also the " worst " movie I had seen up to that point . Water 's group of " talent " included several people who I am sure worked for food , and were willing to say the lines Waters wrote . Every thing about the movie is terrible , acting , camera , editing , and the story about a woman played by 300 lb transvestite Divine was purely absurd . That said , I have to recommend this film because it is very funny , and you won't believe the crap that happens to poor Francine . Her son huffs solvents and stomps unsuspecting women 's feet at the grocery store . Her daughter is the sluttiest slut in town . Her husband is a cackling A-hole of a pornographer who does everything in his power to embarrass and humiliate poor Francine . Francine 's only friend is played by Edith Massey , possibly the worst actress ever . Edith looks and sounds like she is reading the lines off a cue card and has never seen the script prior to filming . Despite all of Francine 's travails , Waters cooks up a fabulous Hollywood ending and everyone ( who survives ) lives happily ever after .  
1	  I 've waited to see this movie for a long time and at last I could manage to see it in Istanbul Film Festival . Maybe because I expected too much from this film and that 's why i was slightly disappointed . I was not the best movie from Korea but still it is really worth watching . The subject was nice and the film makes you keep watching without getting bored though it is long . But there are gaps in the movie and you jump from one point to another . However , the acting of Jeon Do-Yeon is incredibly beautiful . It was was one of the best performances in the early cinema history and I think this movie wouldn't be that nice if she was not in the leading role .  
1	  In Panic In The Streets Richard Widmark plays U.S. Navy doctor who has his week rudely interrupted with a corpse that contains plague . As cop Paul Douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest . That 's not the issue here , the two of them become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease . As was pointed out by any number of people , for some reason director Elia Kazan did not bother to cast the small parts with anyone that sounds like they 're from Louisiana . Having been to New Orleans where the story takes place I can personally attest to that . Richard Widmark and his wife Barbara Bel Geddes can be excused because as a Navy doctor he could be assigned there , but for those that are natives it doesn't work . But with plague out there and the news being kept a secret , the New Orleans PD starts a dragnet of the city 's underworld . The dead guy came off a ship from Europe and he had underworld connections . A New Orleans wise guy played by Jack Palance jumps to a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and starts harassing a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show plague symptoms . Palance got rave reviews in the first film where he received notice . Personally my favorite in this film is Zero Mostel . This happened right before Mostel was blacklisted and around that time he made a specialty of playing would be tough guys who are really toadies . He plays the same kind of role in the Humphrey Bogart film , The Enforcer . Sadly I can kind of identify with Mostel in that last chase scene where he and Palance are being chased down by Widmark , Douglas , and half the New Orleans Police . Seeing the weight challenged Zero trying to keep up with Palance was something else because I 'm kind of in Zero 's league now in the heft department . Kazan kept the action going at a good clip , there 's very little down time in this film . If there was any less it would be an Indiana Jones film . Panic In The Streets won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay that year . Kazan also made good use of the New Orleans waterfront and the French Quarter . Some of the same kinds of shots are later used in On the Waterfront . In fact Panic In The Streets is about people not squealing when they really should in their own best interest . Very similar again to On the Waterfront . Panic In The Streets does everyone proud who was associated with it . Now why couldn't Elia Kazan get some decent New Orleans sounding people in the small roles .  
0	  * SOILER * It 's fake ! The whole thing is a fake ! There is no ghosts or zombies , Alan is a Lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself . So he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala SCOOBY-DOO to drive Alan to commit suicide . Most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them . He 's not even killing them . He drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace . If he looked at the so-called ghost of Evelyn , he could tell she was wearing gloves ! My God what a waste of time . Don't bother watching it , renting and if you bought it and haven't watched it yet , sell it . Quickly ! Do yourself a favor and stay away from THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE . I give this stinker the CRAP-O-LANTERN .  
0	  " Rois et Reine " is a sprawling mess of a movie which will probably irritate as many viewers as it delights . It focuses by turns on ex-lovers Nora ( Emanuelle Devos ) and Ismael ( Mathieu Amalric ) as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives . While Nora 's story is played straight and is sombre in tone , Ismael 's is played mainly for laughs , although it 's not particularly funny . Nora 's crisis is triggered by the terminal illness of her father Louis ( Maurice Garrel ) , and Ismael 's by his sudden incarceration in a mental hospital at the instigation of a mysterious third party . Ismael and Louis are just two of the males who have shaped Nora 's life , and in turn have been shaped by her , the most notable others being her now deceased first lover Pierre and their young son Elias . As events past and present are played out for the audience , and the ex-lovers become involved in each other 's lives once more , it gradually emerges that Nora 's personal take on her life story may be less reliable than first meets the eye . Cult director Arnaud Desplechin has fashioned a considerable oddity here , one which has garnered major plaudits in France . He wilfully eschews established narrative convention and develops the movie via a series of dramatic shifts in mood and tone . Had this approach been founded on a coherent unifying core idea or theme it might have worked , but it 's not clear in the end what exactly Desplechin 's film is actually about . Heavy-handed allusions to Greek mythology and Freudian theory are evidently freighted with meaning but , at least for this unschooled movie-goer , remain less than helpful in illuminating and interpreting the lives of the characters . At other times the treatment lapses into kitsch but the use of the anodyne " Moon River " as the film 's theme tune suggests this is probably deliberate . * Spoiler alert * I suspect a major theme of the movie is the not very original observation that how we see ourselves can differ radically from how others see us or even how we think others see us . This idea is most obviously represented in the film by the violent death of Pierre and the revelation contained in Louis ' secret diary , but unfortunately both events seem entirely disconnected from what has otherwise been revealed to the audience of Pierre and Louis ' respective relationships with Nora . This seems a cheat on Desplechin 's part , as if he is thrusting the idea upon us in unmediated form rather than illustrating it more subtly in the natural course of the narrative . One or two darkly surreal touches imply the presence of an alternative but largely unconscious world of persons stripped frighteningly bare , but again these are felt more as pretentious intrusions of film-making technique rather than eruptions from a deeper reservoir of truth inherent in the story . In fact , for all its heavy-handed hints at depth , the characters are curiously undeveloped and unnuanced , as if they function more as ciphers for their creator 's many ideas about people rather than as real people in their own right . Much of the detail of their lives seems arbitrarily applied rather than organic . For example , Ismael , as we are constantly reminded , is a viola player , but more than two hours pass before we actually see or hear him play , and the effect of his chosen instrument or profession upon his personality is never elaborated . Hence , he may just as well be a marine biologist or a trapeze artist . Amalric brings a certain manic charm to the unhinged but ultimately sane Ismael , but I found Devos cloying and monotone ( which may be intentional , however ) as the elusive Nora . Meanwhile Jean-Paul Roussillon as Ismael 's father , Elsa Wolliaston as his psychoanalyst and Magalie Woch as the psychically wounded but defiant Sinologist he befriends in hospital make the biggest impact amongst the supporting actors . Catherine Deneuve 's in it , too , though her role is little more than a self-referential cameo . Ultimately , " Rois et Reine " is very much an acquired taste . Should it fail to push your buttons , it 's very likely that Desplechin 's undisciplined and florid approach will frustrate and exasperate even as you somehow keep watching .  
0	  Oh dear . I was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of Japan 's Ringu . Well , I guess the U.S. made their version of it as well , but at least it was an outright remake . So , so sad . I very much enjoy watching Filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country , so I can't believe this had to happen . Claudine and Kris are such big names there , surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism . To any aspiring movie makers out there in the Philippines : You do not have to stoop this low to make money . There are many movie buffs that are watching the movies Filipinos put out and enjoying them !  
0	  The movie remains in the gray for far too long . Very little gets explained as the movie progresses , with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch . It sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way I 'm going to do that . It is that I watched this movie in the morning , I 'm sure of it that if I watched this movie in the evening I would had fallen asleep . To me the movie was like a poor man 's " Blade Runner " . The movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities . It makes the movie leave a pointless and non-lasting impression . Also the weird look of the movie doesn't help much . The movie is halve CGI / halve real life but it 's not done halve as good , impressive , spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as " Sin City " and " 300 " . They even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer , which seemed like a very pointless - and odd choice , also considering that the character animation isn't too impressive looking . Sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously wasn't cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really isn't a positive thing to say . Some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting . The main God of the movie constantly says lines such as ; ' I 'm going to do this but it 's none of your concern why I want to do it ' . Than just don't say anything at all Mr. Horus ! It 's irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie , if you don't care to explain anything about the plot . Also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its script . The actors still did their very best . They seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special . So I can't say anything negative about them . The story and movie is far from original . It rip-offs from a lot of classic and semi-classic , mostly modern , science-fiction movies . It perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on me . A failed and uninteresting movie experiment . 3/10  
0	  This is one of the worst movies I saw ! I dunno what are the reasons for shoting suck a crap . Don't waste your time watching this . Good actors , but extremely bad screenplay and dialogues . Hope there 'll be no Blanche 2 :-) Avoid this movie by all means !  
0	  Have you ever heard the saying that people " telegraph their intentions ? " Well in this movie , the characters ' actions do more than telegraph future plans - they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head . This could be forgiven if the setting had been used better , or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced . Embeth Davidtz 's character is not mysterious , just wooden , and Kenneth Branagh doesn't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have . The bottom line : obvious plot , one-note performances , unlikeable characters , and grotesque " Southern " accents employed by British actors .  
0	  A Nightmare on Elm Street : The Dream Child This is a bad movie . There 's no escaping it . I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies . But even being a fan I can't help but see this movie is mediocre . There 's not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters . By now they had just given up . They don't even try . They are the production of course , hoping for a few more easy dollars . The story doesn't grab your attention . Its so simple it 's almost absent . Alice , a survivor from part 4 is now pregnant . Freddy is coming back through the baby 's dreams . At the beginning we learn that to stop him Alice must find his mother . And that 's it . The story advances slowly since there 's so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting . In fact that 's the only scary thing , the acting , since the deaths are not even slightly cool . The characters are so uninteresting we couldn't care less for them . The girls are as unattractive as possible . The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group . I 've seen better actors in school plays . It 's embarrassing really . Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring some class to this . She is beautiful , sexy and has some talent . But the material just didn't let her shine . What a pity . Stephen Hopkins work is nowhere close to Renny Harlin´s brilliant direction in Dream Master . He tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension Harlin and Craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be found . The Dream Child is just another unimaginative sequel . It 's the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name . The end for the once scary Freddy . It 's too sad to see him now . A clown that 's not funny . A bad joke . Goodbye Freddy .  
0	  It is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of Marxism , from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago to the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge , one still finds admirers of Communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor . It just shows the moral depravity of Hollywood . In this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified . Needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included . That both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of worship .  
1	  A story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely swan whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise . Placed at the beginning of talkies , PRIX DE BEAUTE walks a thin line in being a full-on silent film - which is still is at heart - and flirting with sound and sound effects . The effect is a little irritating for anyone coming into this film because the recorded audio is extremely tinny and just doesn't help it at all . Hearing sound stage conversation edited over the beginning sequence which takes place in a beach , for example , is as part of the movie as the actress who dubs Louise Brooks ' dialog and in doing so robs the audience of a fine performance . Other than that , the movie rolls along more or less well , with little jumps in continuity here and there - something quite common in films from this era - and has that vague sped up feel typical of silents . In a way , this is an experiment of a movie , and closer to the style of Sergei Eisenstein in visual presentation and near-intimate closeups that elevate it from what would be a more pedestrian level . Louise Brooks here plays a character less flapper than what she was known for : she 's a stenographer who on a lark decides to enter a beauty contest despite the furious opposition of her extremely smothering boyfriend . Her role is quite Thirties and contemporary for its time ; the last of the flapper / Jazz Baby roles were being shown on screen and now , with the onset of female independence , women as professionals were being represented in film . That Brooks 's character decides to leave her boyfriend ( even if she does " reconcile " with him later ) is also a little ahead of her time . However , her character 's fatal flaw is its willing to believe what isn't there - that her boyfriend wants her to succeed - and this is what leads to her end at the movie theatre . This final sequence looks like something straight out of Hitchcock in its heightened suspense ( seen in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH ) and cuts from Brooks , her image on screen , and the murderous boyfriend . Even more dramatic is the placement of the still singing " live " Brooks with the now dead one - a chilling effect to a chilling , powerful movie .  
0	  For this review , a list of good points and bad points . I 'll start with the bad . Bad points : The casting choices ( especially Burt Reynolds as Boss Hogg ) , the acting of said badly chosen cast , the storyline , the idea of setting the film in the modern day , the direction , the editing , the soundtrack , and above all , the whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that wasn't that great to start with , despite it 's popularity . Good points : Jessica Simpson in a red bikini .. that 's it ! One might make an analogy here . In the scene where Jessica Simpson as Daisy Duke struts her way up to Michael Weston as Enos , and asks the question , " Enos , where 's Boss Hogg and Roscoe ? " , in his clouded judgment , tells her where they are . She might just as well have asked , " Enos , is this a good movie ? " , the red bikini would have clouded his judgment into saying yes , even though in his right mind he would have said , " No , not really . " As good as she looked in the bikini , she could have been stark naked , and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of film-making . Stay out of Hazzard !  
0	  This must be accompanied by a special rating and warning : NOT RECOMMENDED TO NORMAL PEOPLE . The obsession of Daneliuc with the most dirty body functions becomes here a real nightmare . Also , it 's evident that the man is a misanthrope , he hates everybody - his country his people , his actors , his job . And this hatred makes him blind and he forgets anymore the profession he knew long ago . This so called " film " is just a hideous string of disgusting images , with no artistic value and no professionist knowledge . It is an insult to good taste and to good sense . Shame , shame , shame !  
0	  What the F * @ # was this I just watched ? Steven STOP ! Please ! This movie is insatiably bad and silly . In a bizarre departure from action and adventure , Mr. Seagal is now fighting ( obviously ) wish they were vampire ' like ' creatures with super human strength . ? OK ? Oh , and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way ? Wow ! Even still in this movie however , to quell Seagals have to have the last punch and no one can kick my a $ ego , HE is somehow stronger than they are . However all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him . Come on , I can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer , but these are super human strength people . Oh and get this , Seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues , because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is Wolverine ! Oh My GO .. And worst than all of that ! Yes , there is a worse than that . He has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face . They obviously sound nothing like him and I believe it may be one of the other actors in the film . It was pure madness . Although I wanted to turn it off I always watch a movie to he end . This is an all time low even for your direct to video movies Steven . Awful ! Awful ! Awful ! Two thumbs down ! Redemeption qualities ? Well I guess so , I will be fair in that aspect . At least some of the special effects were OK , and I like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses . The women all were quite attractive IMO . Still , and I said STILL , it does not make up for the blatant X-Men , Underworld , ( insert your favorite zombie , vampire movie here ) rip off ! The director , writer , producer , ALL should be bansihed & exile from the movie business . I think I feel the way that most people feel about Blood Rayne ( and just about all other Uwe Boll pictures ) about this film . That 's my whole $ 1.00 on this film . View if you dare .  
0	  Horrible . I see many user comments on how great this show is . It truly is a Wanna-Be-Friends - Made in Taiwan knockoff . The jokes are lame as .. and the plot is ridiculous . The actors are obviously struggling to be funny and are probably cringing when they hit those awful punchlines ( if you can call them that ) . The bulk of the other users who have commented are obviously from another planet ( or at least another continent ) . There are obviously reasons that TV companies cancel shows .. and none of then are when shows are doing well . Make sense ? Anyway , steer clear - even if it is raining and there is absolutely nothing else on this planet to do .. go stand in the rain instead - more fun .  
0	  Obvious attack on Microsoft made by people who don't appear to understand intellectual property or market economies generally . Loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of bill gates , and is a cartoonish corporate villain ordering murders right and left . While microsoft may engage in some anticompetitive activity at times , it 's unlikely they actually murder people . Therefore , the film is over the top and ridiculous from the beginning . The " deeper " point is apparently that major tech innovations should be free to the public , and not subject to intellectual property laws . However , this ignores the fact that most major innovations would never have been developed if not for the market incentives ( and rewards ) provided by intellectual property . It 's one thing to be opposed to anti-competitive conduct - that 's common sense . It 's quite another to be opposed to market competition in the first place , which is what the film 's mantra ( " knowledge belongs to mankind " ) represents . Yet another example of Hollywood being completely out of touch with reality .  
0	  I 'm not a big fan of rom / coms at the best of times . A few have been quite good ( check of Dream for an Insomniac ) , but this one is just more of the same but less . With a running time of 100min , I expect more than 1 laugh every 30mins . The only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends instinctivly help out Lee 's character . All I can say is AVOID . I gaurentee there is at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you $ 3 of out 10 ( And only cos I 'm a big Lee fan )  
0	  I have never watched a movie in so little time . The only salvation was the fast forward function on the DVD unit . It was like watching a poorly produced CBC film . There was obviously no money for lighting , filming , sets , location , scriptwriters , editors , actors .. Oh , there was absolutely no story either ! I need to write ten lines of comment .. Bad , awful , horrible , wretched , anguishing , tortuous , bilious , nauseous , sickening , fromage , disgusting , flimsy , icky , yucky , pukey , stinky , smelly , vile , putrid , all-thumbs-down , and I don't know if I can keep on going to complete all ten lines of just how bad this piece of crap-o-matic production was !  
1	  " Sandra , the Making of a Woman " is a standout among exploitation films , and is so for two reasons : ( 1 ) an excellent , yet effortless , performance by Monica Gayle , and ( 2 ) the fact that Gary Graver was at the helm of the project . These two talents , both of whom are quite underrated , make " Sandra " a film that should be seen . Another key element of the film 's success is its realism - there is nothing fake or " Hollywood " about this set-in-California film . It is truly a slice of life . The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film , the simple dresses worn by the character , the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart bouncing at her front door , and Sandra sits on the couch without make-up , while Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics , looking truly as if she just woke up ( but nevertheless beautiful ) , the harmless weirdo Sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a bra , the one-room apartment into which Sandra moves - all of these elements of the film seem totally real , and as such , the viewer is drawn into Sandra 's little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed . Sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class . This film could have easily failed in less competent hands , and could have gone off in any of the usual sexploitation directions , but the Garver / Gale team see to it that " Sandra " is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film .  
0	  My Favorite part was when the credits started to roll . I wish I could give it a . 0000000000001 out of 10 . I really wish I had that Hour and thirty minutes back . Don't waste your money or time on it . I really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards . Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie didn't destroy her career . But she chose to be in it . All in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked . More than Kazaam and Glitter combined . That 's saying something . Don't Do it !  
0	  It looks to me as if the creators of " The Class Of Nuke ' Em High " wanted it to become a " cult " film , but it ends up as any old high school B-movie , only tackier . The satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely steretyped characters . It 's very un-funny , even for a turkey .  
0	  .. then they will have a proper place to file this crap . Sorry , not a " mystery " as claimed , it is religious mumbo-jumbo . I kept waiting for the " unimaginable evil " that was promised me , but the " evil " in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilities . I can't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment . Unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them , and I will likely avoid anything they do in the future . I 'm also a little cheesed off that I now have a writer 's name and director 's name to memorize as I 'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too . It 's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10 , etc . will get their reviews posted first . This could lead to more people getting tricked , as I was , into believing this movie was something other than religious preaching . Well , it 's off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising . Too bad they can't give me back the 105 minutes I wasted watching this thinking that it was actually a Hollywood horror / supernatural film .  
1	  Vertigo co-stars Stewart ( in his last turn as a romantic lead ) and Novak elevate this , Stewart 's other " Christmas movie , " movie to above mid-level entertainment . The chemistry between the two stars makes for a fairly moving experience and further revelation can be gleaned from the movie if witchcraft is seen as a metaphor for the private pain that hampers many people 's relationships . All in all , a nice diversion with legendary stars , 7/10 .  
1	  This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris , a high school science teacher / baseball coach , who is inspired by his players to try out for the pros and fulfill his life-long dream of playing in the majors . Dennis Quaid , no stranger to sports films , plays Morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of recreating the real-world events that led to Morris brief stint as a relief pitcher for the woefull Tampa Bay Devil Rays . The first half of the film , dealing with his rag tag bunch of High School Baseball players ( all of whom look way too old to actualy be in High School ) is less effective and probably a bit too long . Overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without . However , it is still a fairly involving movie with an inspirational theme that proves once again that baseball is the national pastime for a reason . GRADE : B-  
1	  Stephen King was raised on flicks like this . - Flicks NOT films . Movies like this and ' Jeepers Creepers ' are " throwbacks " to the good ' ol day drive-in horror flicks . They are meant to be fun , cheaply made and hopefully : a few good scares . Anyone looking for a theory on the human condition should pass on this creature feature because that 's all this is .. all it ever will be . Stop trashing what has already deemed itself as trash . - Good , fun , trash ! If you enjoyed this I recommend : ' Jeepers Creepers ' ' Jeepers Creepers 2 ' ' 30 Days of Night ' ' Scarecrows ' ( ' 88 ) ' They Live ' ' Planet Terror ' ' Death Proof ' and ' Halloween II : Season of the Witch '  
1	  What an entertaining movie . Astaire and Randolph Scott are in the Navy . Astaire has to woo back Ginger in San Francisco , while Scott must be persuaded that Harriet Hilliard is worthy of being his wife . Everything works out fine . It 's sometimes argued , and I can see why , that Scott 's romance with Hilliard is unnecessary and slows the plot down . Especially painful are Hilliard 's singing of sappy love songs . I could have done without her singing , right enough , but I found the romance rather touching . Hilliard enters the movie as a music teacher , wearing a pair of spectacles , no makeup , and the ugliest clothes known to man or beast . No wonder Scott avoids her until she grooms herself sexily under the tutelage of her sister Ginger and a slinky Lucille Ball . The problem is that AFTER her makeover she looks like the same irretrievably plain woman as before , only with a glossier outfit . It 's tough enough for a homely guy . But at least a man can become wealthy and powerful and popular , then he can collect women anyway , even if he looks like JoJo the Dog-Faced Boy . But what does a plain-looking woman do ? The same avenues to romance aren't open to her . Henry Kissinger had groupies . Did Margaret Thatcher ? It must be terrible to be an ordinary woman in a culture as cruel as ours . As a kind of a footnote , I must mention that Randolph Scott was rumored to be bisexual by Hollywood gossips who needed some nonsense to chew on , and it 's kind of amusing that he has the following line in this film when he 's putting homely Hilliard off - " Women don't interest me , sister . " The movie probably gives more quality time to Ginger Rogers than any of her other films with Astaire . And she 's marvelous . She 's beautiful , sexy , a talented actress and dancer , and the script gives her good comic lines too . " Let 's kiss and make up , " suggests Astaire . " Let 's just make up , " she says , " that will give you something to work on . " It 's also the only film she made with Astaire that gives her a solo number during an audition . ( Choreographed by Hermes Pan . ) Her performance is accidentally sabotaged by Astaire who slips some Alka Seltzer or something into her water , and she hiccups through her number , burping being too indelicate for the time . As a dancer , I 'd make a terrific circus elephant so my opinion must be taken as that of an amateur , but I think their dances together are the equal of any they put on film . Their first , during a dancing contest , " Let Yourself Go , " is the most wildly exuberant of any I can remember . And the only dramatic duet , " Let 's Face the Music and Dance , " must be among their finest . The last step as they exit is startling . I like the film for reasons with personal resonance . I remember seeing it for the first time in a theater in downtown San Diego , next to a shop called " The Seven Seas " that catered to sailors . I was in uniform at the time and was impressed with the treatment of the naval careers of Astaire and Scott . What I mean is , here we have this frothy musical comedy which owed absolutely nothing to historical reality , and yet , unlike most of their other teamings , pays its dues anyway . Jumping ship , Astaire calls out for a " water taxi . " I had just taken a water taxi ashore myself . The uniforms are correct to the period ( unlike , say , those in " On the Town " ) . And they 're worn properly , hats down to two finger-widths above the eyebrow and not cocked back . And there are two incidents in which Astaire runs into a problem with naval authorities and they 're both handled with perfect seriousness and are thoroughly believable . An officer stops Astaire from leading a jazz band during inspection and reports to the captain , " They were playing when the call was sounded , sir . I 'm certain no breach of discipline was intended . " It 's what an officer - a good officer - would say , and nobody laughs . The series was getting a little repetitious by the time " Follow the Fleet " was made so instead of putting Fred into high society and a tuxedo , they turned him into a gum-chewing swabbie instead . It was a good idea . And the dance numbers are up to the concept .  
0	  Absolutely one of the worst movies of all time . Low production values , terrible story idea , bad script , lackluster acting .. and I can't even come up with an adjective suitably descriptive for how poor Joan River 's directing is . I know that there 's a special place in Hell for the people who financed this film ; prolly right below the level reserved for child-raping genocidal maniacs . This movie is a trainwreck . ( Terrible ) x ( infinity ) = Rabbit Test . Avoid this at all costs . It 's so bad , it isn't even funny how bad it is .  
1	  I am decidedly not in the target audience for this film . I am a man nearly 50 who has only recently stumbled across the world of independent film . This happened quite by accident , with the discovery of a movie called Clerks late one night on television . The first two things I noticed about that film were that it was 1 ) technically amateurish and 2 ) brilliantly written . When I read an interview with the director in the local paper and he said that one of his influences was Clerks , I started to get interesting . When he said his main influence was The Station Agent , a movie I 'd seen on DVD a week prior , I decided I had to go and check it out . The result could be described along the same lines as Clerks , although the two films are nothing alike content wise . Both films suffer from technical gaffes that are overcome through amazing writing . Whereas Clerks is a day in the life of a man who has nothing in his life at all and is afraid to ask tough questions about himself and his situation , Less Like Me is about a man who seemingly forces himself to be constantly busy , he 's always running one way or another , filling his life with little things so that he will never have to deal with the big ones . The themes and ideas of this film are strong and poignant . I can tell from watching it that not much has changed since I was growing up , young men still have the same problems they always have . The writer dresses up these problems and themes in the modern vernacular , crafts wonderfully honest characters , and has them do completely believable things . As far as indie cinema goes , this may not be perfect from a technical standpoint , but from an artistic one , it is very close .

1	  Deeply emotional . It can't leave you neutral . Yes it 's a love story between 2 18 years old boys . But it 's only the body of this movie . And it 's been removed . You only feel what happened with these boys . You feel the soul of the movie . With of course some action , some sex , but this is no pornography , too many feelings . It was only a summer " story " , and it became , from love to hate , almost to death , the most important time of their lives . I loved it , you will too , whatever your feelings are .  
1	  I am not going to lie . Despite looking interesting , I watched The Notorious Bettie Page because I had heard ( and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film ) , that Gretchen Mol got naked in it . I have never been a fan of Mol , but I cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes . Yes , that may be perverted , but its a theme and ideal central to the very core of the movie , and helps to make the film a lot stronger than it probably should be . The film chronicles Bettie Page 's ( Mol ) life from her physical and sexually abused days as a kid in high school in the South , and onto her new life in New York . She wants to be an actress , but she has to pay bills too . After taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach , Page slowly becomes a modeling sensation , and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin-up photographs . I feel the briefness of the film ( just over ninety minutes ) is both a curse and blessing for it . On one hand , the film never overstays its welcome . You get to know Page within a few short minutes , and then it gets right into her modeling career and does not look back . But it curses the film as well , because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on . She just kind of jumps around between modeling shoots and the controversies that they create before jumping right into the major senate investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film . You just sit there , and attempt to absorb it all , and more just comes right at you . It feels like the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in too short a film . It begs for longer sequences , and begs more for even longer explanations . It does not feel rushed ; it just does not feel all there . Another bit of a fumble , although a bit more of a curiosity , is the use of colour throughout the film . The majority is in black and white , but frequently , splashes and sequences of colour do emerge . But while this may have been done as a symbolic gesture early on , it becomes a bit of a distraction as it continually pops up later on before cutting back to black and white . It gets confusing , and becomes more of a tedious interference than anything else as the film goes on . While it may fumble a bit with the actions , the film stays dead-on with its themes . Page , who I know little to nothing about , is played off innocently , and her world is exactly the same . Save for a few shady characters during her teenage years , everyone she encounters is an innocent , and everything she does has an innocence to it . I never thought I would look at full frontal nudity as being something that was anything other than vulgar and depraved , but here , it truly is something to marvel at . All at once , it is beautiful and innocent . Even the most sexually perverted moments in the film ( albeit tame compared to today 's standards ) have an innocent and angelic feeling to them . There is just something about the way Mol 's nude body is portrayed that it just strikes at such a different chord than nude bodies in other films . It just feels so natural and so wondrous , that if there were any reason to watch the film , it would be to see the spectacular depictions of Mol 's body as she plays Bettie Page . The other reason is Mol herself . As Page , she exemplifies that 1950 's Southern belle everyone knows ( or can at least imagine ) . Despite her profession , she is still a normal person , and still looks at herself as being religious . Mol plays her exactly to the right amount of squeaky-cleanliness needed to make this character feel authentically from the 1950 's . She plays her with such matter-of-factness that you would be hard-set not to think that Mol was actually Bettie Page herself . Unfortunately , the supporting cast have very little moments to shine , and are totally overshadowed by Mol 's wonderful performance . None of them do anything particularly pleasing , and none of them really have that same strength in their role as Mol does . This is not really the fault of the actors , but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with . Many of them are totally recognizable , such as Oscar-nominee David Strathairn ( in a role a little too close to one of his better performances ) , Sarah Paulson ( recent Golden Globe nominee for Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip ) , and character actor Lili Taylor , but you would be hard set to really place their performance in being anything other than okay . None of these characters are really developed , and they really just stand as character cut-outs who Mol runs loops around as she picks up steam in her brilliant performance . Really , this film is worthwhile for its portrayal of nudity , and for Gretchen Mol 's excellent performance of Bettie Page . Everything else is a bit too muddled and awkward than it should be . Had more work been done to develop supporting characters and not just blast right through the story , this film would have been a much better biographical film . As it stands , it is just a vehicle for Mol to really rise into the stratosphere of popularity as an actress . 7/10 .  
0	  Where was his critique of democratic administrations as well as republican ones ? After all he did serve for 17 + years in a body of government where his influence was unwaivering . Oh I forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the most Powerful nation on Earth . The film is happy to show shots of a young Senator Gore asking why a NASA scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper , but fails to ask about the complicity of Clinton / Gore in global warming . Probably too close to an election year , or maybe it would hurt the chances for Hillary in ' 08 . Either way he 's a political coward and party man to the bitter end . He offers no criticism of consumerism , no criticism of capitalism , no way to is the history of the industrial development which has led us to this point in time In the end this film was much more about Mr. Gore himself than about any real problems our environment faces . Mr. Gore if you really wanted to make a campaign film - shorten it & call it what it really is .  
0	  Please do not let the cover of this movie fool you . And if you 're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at : this isn't it . Usually I will go for stupid if it 's funny , but this stupid was so stupid it almost ( or possibly did ) make me stupid . The film quality is better than a handheld , but not by much , and it 's quite possible the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on a Casio keyboard . These problems should never really be a deterent from seeing a horror movie but add this amazing ( weep ) cast , and you have a real humdinger . The story is about a guy who invites his friends up to his family cabin in Texas for the weekend . He also extends the invitation to his lady crush in his office . On the way there they meet a female in distress , who is then invited to come along by the other girls . The stay at the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone 's panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up in the house . From there you ( the audience ) and the morons , um , actors , try to figure out what 's going on and they soon begin to distrust one another . Overall I think I have made it sound better than it is . The main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped , the plot contrived , the acting bad and the motivations clueless . Once more this could be forgiveable it it was the least bit funny but alas , it is not . The twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway . Please don't let this review stop you from seeing the shear wonderment of this movie . ( Woah , my nose just grew eight inches . )  
0	  As a member of the cast , I was a member of the band at all the basketball games , I would like to let the world know after being in the movie , that we were not allowed to see it since it was banned in Oregon . This was due to the producers and the director breaking the contract with the University of Oregon where it was shot . Seems that the U of O sign was shown . While we were shooting , we were allowed to eat several meals with the cast and production staff . Mr Nicholson was quite memorable for being one of the most ill-mannered men I have ever met . Quite a time for a young 20 year old . BUt certainly not what campus life was really like in the late 60 's and early 70 's despite what Hollywood may think . Trombone player from Oregon  
1	  I have to admit , this movie moved me to the extent that I burst in tears . However , I always think about things twice , and instead of writing a eulogy that would define the film as flawless and impeccable , I prefer taking the risk of a closer look . First what 's first : The movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts out and continues as a slow-paced movie that doesn't try to blow you away with the actual scenes from 9/11 . Thumbs up for this stroke of genius , because , unlike Stone 's WORLD TRADE CENTER this film fortunately doesn't focus on the attack itself but on the fallout which , similar to the fallout of a nuclear explosion , is hardly visible but nonetheless dangerous and devastating . The psychological impact , the sheer devastation that 9/11 caused and the havoc it wreaked on the American people is almost palpable in this movie . I think Binder managed an astute observation of the American post 9/11 society and Sandler in my opinion sky rocketed from an average comedy actor to a real talent who delivers a performance worthy of an Oscar . However : In the film BLOOD DIAMOND , the Di Caprio character says and I quote : " Ah , these Americans . Always want to take about their feelings " . Now , I don't want to belittle their sufferíngs , but I sure would like to make a comparison . Ever since 9/11 the entire world is confronted with mementos , memorials and commemorations of 9/11 . The Hollywood industry and writers such as Safran Foer more than allude to 9/11 in their works . Now , this huge amount of cultural products , dealing with 9/11 , turn the death of 3000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century . The number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject , and I say this with all due respect , blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of proportion . Fact is : People die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people . We have a war in Iraq , in Afghanistan , in Birma and lots of other countries . On a daily basis , we forget about the poverty the African people suffer from and we tend do empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the American victims of 9/11 simply because they are black and because their lives don't have much in common with our Western lives . Africa neither has the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies in a way America can . So , what I am saying is this : The reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of 9/11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9/11 . Not a day goes by without a newspaper article , a film or a book that discusses 9/11 . In conclusion : I commiserated with Charlie Fineman , but I wasn't sure whether I had the right to feel for him more than for a Hutu who lost his entire family in the Rwandan civil war . You catch my thrift ?  
0	  I grew up watching and loving TNG . I just recently finished watching the entire series ST Voyager on DVD , which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode , as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldn't be more stark . The idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand Riker 's character , which is how it probably would have been treated on VOY . They could have featured memories that would be " new " to the audience , rather than simply regurgitating old show clips . The in and out transitions between the " memories " and the " present " in this episode start as cliché in the beginning , and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern wears on and on . Bar none - worst episode ever .  
1	  Water Lilies is a well-made first film from France about young female sexuality and friendship . Sciamma works with specialized , slightly sanitized material that is as off-putting to some as it is alluring to others . The film focuses exclusively on three middle-class teenage girls in a tidy new Paris suburb . Their lives revolve around a big indoor swimming pool where two of the three are part of a synchronized water ballet team . Such distractions as parents , siblings , work and school have been neatly excised from the equation . The central sensibility belongs to the attractively sullen but skinny Marie ( Pauline Acquart ) , who is not on the team , but thinks she would like to be . Marie worships Floriane ( Adèle Haenel ) , an alluring blonde and team standout whom the boys are after . This takes Marie away from her former best friend , also a member of the water ballet team , the somewhat plump Anne ( Louise Blachère ) . Being less special Anne is more truly accessible to the boys . Floriane , like this film , promises a bit more then she truly offers . Marie has the more essential quality for a teenage girl : she suffers inwardly . Flroiane doesn't so much suffer as jump into situations and then bolt . Marie is dazzled by the glamor of the water ballet as well as Floriane . Floriane takes advantage of this to make Marie first her slave and a cover for her assignations , then , lacking any other friends , her confidante . All the other girls think Floriane a slut , an illusion she encourages in the men and boys she teases , because it leads them on . She suffers the pretty girl 's fate of being not a person but an object , and she can't resist the validation the boys give her by wanting to kiss her and bed her , but she doesn't really care about any of them and knows her involvements with them are a trap . Enlisting Marie to act as her pal so her ( unseen ) mother won't know she 's going out to meet boys , she also gets Marie to rescue her from the boys later . It looked the opposite at first , but Floriane needs Marie as much as Marie thinks she needs her . Anne is left with her discomfort with her body and a desire to get laid that 's earthier and more real than the other girls ' . Keeping all external context at bay , Sciamma can highlight subtle shifts in the delicate equation of the three girls ' goals and interactions . On the other hand the film 's water madness , which includes lots of showering and spitting as well as underwater swimming shots , makes it feel completely airless at times and some of its 95 minutes do not pass so quickly . Luckily the film has a sense of humor and lets the trio sometimes forget their ever-present goals and avoidances and just do silly , pointless girl things . It 's the offbeat moments that give the film life ; too bad in a way that there aren't more of them . But Sciamma has the courage of her obsessions and what remains as one walks out of the theater is the personalities and their dynamics . Along the way of course it is pleasant to watch the swimming and to gaze at the girls , who understandably love to gaze at themselves . There 's no great revelation or drama on the way , but things get a bit more interesting when it emerges that Marie doesn't just admire but truly desires Floriane and is jealous of her boyfriends-whom Floriane always stops before they go all the way . In a typical irony of this kind of plot , Floriane actually decides she wants to have her first real sex with Marie-but Marie is the one who holds off , because she knows it won't have the significance to Floriane that it will have to her . When it happens , it 's a timid , mechanical affair . Meanwhile Anne has a huge crush on Francois ( Warren Jacquin ) , a male swimmer , but of course he is after Floriane . Boys are not an element that 's been subtracted and there always seem to be several dozen ready at poolside or on the dance floor , but they are just bodies and faces , available studs .  
1	  It is said that David Lynch 's films and shorts won't appeal to everyone . Neither will Dumbland , maybe more than ever . I have a feeling that Dumbland , as people come across it , will be a true mark of ' I get it ' or ' what the hell ' . It 's not surrealism exactly , but absurd to the point of no return . It 's also very , very , very stupid . But in this stupidity can be a sort of ironic intelligence to it , that the maker knows so well how childish and repugnant this is , and this self-consciousness is a plus , not a detraction . It 's just a bunch of crudely drawn shorts - the kind that might not even make it on Hertzfeldt and Judge 's Animation show ( which , I might add , Lynch here has a lot in common with both directors in their work - centered on a lummox with an IQ of 20 who has a constantly quivering-with-fear wife , and a child who looks like a cross between the gingerbread man and / or an alien . The episodes include little situations like a faulty treadmill , a salesman who can recite the Gettysburg address , watching over a sick brother in law , ant hallucinations , and just wallowing on the couch with noise all around . All the while , Lynch is still experimenting , as he was constantly for better or worse during the period of five years he made on and off Inland Empire . For one thing , he 's going back to the roots of his very first short , Six Figures Getting Sick Six Times , in the usage of repetition as a means to an end . This sometimes works excruciatingly well , and sometimes not . Sometimes , like with the episode with the sitting around the house doing nothing as teeth are bleeding and a fly buzzes around , the absurdism sort of waxes and wanes without much of a good effect . And even an episode like with the guy 's friend coming over is funny more-so for the Beavis & Butt-head comparison ( both laugh like idiots , and are equally engrossed by killing things like fish and sheep ) . What ends up working is how Lynch shows up front delirious abstractions , in the crudest ways imaginable , and excessive violence . In what comes closest to surrealism in " ants " , the guy mistakenly sprays bug-spray ( just called " Kill " , one of Lynch 's very cheap but fun pokes at societal conventions ) on himself , and envisions ants in a musical chorus line , solos included . And one of the most harrowingly funny things I 've ever seen from the filmmaker is " get the stick " , where we just see the guy , cheered on by his son , getting a stick lodged in his mouth . Soon the neck breaks , eyes pop out , and once said stick is removed he doesn't watch out for traffic waddling like a manhole cover . Other moments pop up like this in unexpected crevices , and it 's drawn as if on cheap paper with an impetus to shock with foul-mouthed language ( mostly from the man , as well as from the ' grandmother ' , who in one of Lynch 's voices for the characters is the deepest of all ) , and a shaky quality that 's reminiscent of the cream of the crop from ( early ) Hertzfeldt . All the same I 'm still not sure if Dumbland is something I would put into someone 's hands if they haven't seen much of Lynch yet let alone anything by him . There are some little points on society made via complete exaggerations that may or may not be in Lynch 's mind closer than we usually think to those in real life . However in general there 's not a whole lot that should be read into it , which is why I 'd say more than half who see it will hate it with a passion . Those who dig the bottom-less pits of animated comedy , be prepared have a blast .  
0	  This is one of those films that I could only sit through once . Charlotte Henry is fine - in fact , all the actors were fine . The problem was in the script , the dialog , the direction , the editing , the sets and the special effects . Granted , this was 1933 , but it really creaked . Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen , Gary Cooper , W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable ( there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming ) . The movie just clumped along with no cohesion . Much of Lewis Carrols spirit , humor and continuity are missing . What a pity ! It 's such a great book . I would recommend Disney 's 1951 version .  
1	  All I can say is , if you don't fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie , then you 're not human ! Even after watching it for the first time , I was hooked . It is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe , as I 'm sure other fans will attest to . After watching it , you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us . At least we have Grey Gardens to remember them ! I think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with . Although I have always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy , she does not stay in your heart the way Big and Little Edie do . What a rare treat to have know such people ; I only wish I had !  
0	  This movie is most possibly the worst movie I have ever see in my entire life ! The plot is ridiculous and the whole " Little Man " crap is just so stupid . The entire movie is unrealistic and dumb . Let 's face it , It 's just a " Black Comedy " . This is just a pointless horrible piece that should have never made it to theaters . The jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous . Please , I beg of to you save your money than see this worthless piece of crap . I had to endure sitting through Little Man for an hour and a half wishing my eyes would bleed . I am disgusted that something like this would even be thought of ! Who writes this crap ? The actors have NO talent what so ever , how do these people get into Hollywood ? They are making money off this junk !  
1	  For me this is Ealing Studio 's most perfect film - as fresh and relevant half a century later as it was the day it was released . As a satire on economic notions of ' growth ' and the commercial need for in-built obsolescence , it could scarcely be more up to the minute . And of what other film can it be said that the hero literally wears the plot ? Oddly , there are parallels with Jurassic Park , in which messing with the environment will literally turn round and bite you . But Spielberg shied away from the book 's brilliant central conceit to tack on some nonsense about ' children ' . Hmm . In The Man In The White Suit , Alec Guiness plays an idealistic young scientist who comes up with a cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out . Suddenly workers and capital at the northern English mill where he is working are united as never before in protection of their livelihoods . Of course , being Ealing , it 's a comedy , but it needn't have been . The complex interplay of vested ( should that be suited ? ) interests plays out beautifully , as one by one all parties realize that ' progress ' is a threat , and that disposability and waste are what keep the looms turning . But , yes , this is a comedy - albeit a pointed one - and amid the political ironies are delicious performances , and some good old-fashioned knock-about laughs . Nonetheless , it 's the biting satire that endures - dazzling and white .  
0	  This movie is not just bad , not just corny , it is repulsive . Something about Daphne , about the creepy call-girl , about the whole damn ( and I use the word literally ) film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress . This film makes my skin crawl , makes me regret having reproductive organs , and makes me feel unclean . One of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept . A creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results , rather than the cliché Worst Nightmare and the overdone Twisted Wish , is a truly fascinating film idea . Thought : The reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights . During the day , bright lights don't show up well , so they could go anywhere . Count the Hobgoblins : Four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio , and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush-toys are killed throughout the course of the movie . Discussion Question : If you had a frigid , demanding , unappreciative girlfriend , would you enter garden-tool-combat with a military chunkhead ? Explain .  
1	  The cast is excellent , the acting good , the plot interesting , the evolvement full of suspense .. but it is hard to cram all those elements into a film that is barely 80 minutes long . If more time was taken to develop the plot and subplots , it would have a much better effect . Another 30 minutes of substance would have made this a very good film rather then just a good one .  
1	  This independent , B & W , DV feature consistently shocks , amazes and amuses with it 's ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them . It 's all hilarious and ridiculous stuff , yet as absurd as much of the film should be , there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film grounded , keeps the entire piece from drifting into complete craziness and therein lies the real message here . This film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad . That seems to be the heart of the film . For as insane and off the wall as things get , Leon , the 30 yr . old paperboy-protagonist , always tries to keep it together . He 's like a child forever trying to catch the balloon that is floating away so that everything will work out for the best , so that everyone can have what they want . The acting in the film could have went far over the top but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive . Van Meter is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a performance that shines through her absurd diseased tics . Just as the characters in the film do , we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the real person underneath . Majkowski is a true genius here . He takes the utmost ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real . It is his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing afloat . It 's a true testament to the skill of Majkowski and all involved that this film , with it 's grating plot and characters , never once works our nerves . Majkowski has taken a film that could have been abrasive and repugnant , and somehow given it heart and humor . This is a unique film . Not to be missed .  
1	  This filmed presentation of " the Rime of the Ancient Mariner " is a most beautiful and interesting rendition of Coleridge 's haunting poem . The striking cinematography , combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 by world famous artists , and Michael Redgrave 's superb narration , are very well worth the time to view this excellent visual work . In the age of television , such work as this is an invaluable tool to induce young students , as well as adults , to explore and to learn the value of great poetry . To the best of my knowledge , this kind of work is indeed rare ; that is regrettable . As a student of world literature and as a former college professor and academic counselor , I feel that more great epic poems like Coleridge 's " Rime of the Ancient Mariner " should be so " translated . " Although not a movie critic , but as an avid reader of classic literature , I am glad to recommend this fine production without any reservations whatsoever .  
1	  Surely one of the best British films ever made , if not one of the best films ever made anywhere . Script , cinematography , direction and acting in a class on their own . This film works on so many levels . So why is it completely unavailable on tape , DVD . Never shown on TV ? Why is it hidden away when it is regularly shown at the National Film Theatre in London to packed houses ?  
1	  This is the best movie I 've come across in a long while . Not only is this the best movie of its kind ( school shooting ) The way Ben Coccio ( the director ) decided to film it was magnificent . He filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school . He filmed it in the actors own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film . Also the actors were filming too using camcorders making it seem much more like a video diary . It is almost artful . ( if that is indeed a word ) There are a few slip ups however , for example when Cal calls brads ( ? ) land rover a range rover ( or vice versa , It 's been awhile since I 've seen it )  
1	  If there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it . So bad it wasn't intended to be that way . But superb anyway .. Go find it somewhere . Whatever you do .. Do not miss it !  
0	  I say ' I 'd figure ' in that line because , frankly , I 've not seen a Hal Hartley movie until now . It 's not that I haven't heard of him though , as he was seen as one of those small NY filmmakers ( when I say small I mean even smaller than Jim Jarmusch ) , who made ultra-personal projects on limited budgets . In an ironic way , much as with Pasolini 's Salo , though in a slightly different context , Fay Grim interests me to see some of Hartley 's more acclaimed features , because there seems to be at least present some semblance of talent behind it , as if Hartley * could * be a very good filmmaker who may be so good he 's just taken a big experimental blunder . Or , on the other hand , he could just be someone far too impressed with his own idiosyncrasies and would-be Godard-like cinematic collisions . I can't quite explain the story , which may or may not be a problem I suppose , however it 's not really in due to not having seen the film that preceded Fay Grim , Henry Fool . I think even if I had that experience it wouldn't make too much of a difference based on the final results . There 's a lot of international espionage , a double plot wrapped inside of another that 's fallen through the fake pockets of the title character , played in an aloof way by Parker Posey ( not sure if that 's good or bad either , maybe both ) , and also involving a CIA operative ( Jeff Goldblum , as usual a solid presence amid the mania , even conjuring some laughs ) , not to mention an orgy-laden picture box , and author Henry Fool . It 's not that the script is totally impenetrable , however much it goes into over-extended loopholes just for the sake of it , because there are some touches of witty or affectingly strange dialog . Quite simply , the direction just sucks . Harltey is in love with the Third Man , which is fine , but he imposes a consistently headache inducing style of everything being tilted in angle , with characters having to get into frame equally oddly . Not since Battlefield Earth , in fact , has a director come off so annoyingly in trying to make the unnecessary choice of titled angles for some bizarre dramatic effect , only this time Hartley isn't amid a cluster-f * , he 's mostly responsible for it . This , along with the crazy wannabe Godard title-cards that pop in here and there , some a little amusing and some just totally stupid , and the montage segments all in still shots , AND a couple of moments involving action that almost call to mind Ed Wood , undermine any of the potential that is in the script , which is already fairly hard to decipher . In a way , it 's fascinating to watch how bad this all goes , but a kind of fascination that comes in seeing the flip-side to total creative control on a sort-of small-scale story . But let it be known : you 'll likely not come across a more wretchedly pretentious example of American independent film-making this year .  
0	  " Arahan " adds nothing positive to the Kung Fu genre . To compare this confused motion picture with the inspired craziness and quality of Stephen Chow 's films is a mistake . Firstly the fight scenes are nothing new . All that is presented here has been done before and better by the likes of Yimou Zhang , Tony Jaa and Jackie Chan . Fights in intelligent Motion Pictures need logic . There seems no point serving blows that have no damaging effect as in the " Matrix " sequels . The attractive female lead So-Yi Yoon captivated the screen but she never convincingly conquered the physical demands of the role as Ziyi Zhang had done so easily in " House Of Flying Daggers " . Having a Martial Arts background serves well in Kung Fu movies . To cast actors inexperienced in these skills is a serious mistake ( See Aya Ueto in " Asumi " ) unless you are a very talented director which as " Arahan " proves Seung-wan Ryoo is not .  
0	  I guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story .. It 's about two young girls who molest a grown man for 48hrs . ; I don't see where the terror comes into play here .. There are some " weird ' and " surreal " sequences in the movie . And the two girls ( Sandra Locke and .. ah .. oh well ) play the roll of two psycho-man haters to the hilt .. they do a pretty good job ( although some of it is just a tad over the top ) . The movie 's not good , and it 's not horrible ; it 's just really really dated ! I mean this thing is dripping with the 70 's .. It 's not really bad if you like that sort of thing .. you know .. that thang ?  
0	  Entertainment Tonight has been going down hill for the last few years , but as of last night ( Aug 17th 2006 ) they reached a new low . In an effort to try to hype up their broadcast , they decided to post actual photos of JonBenet Ramsey 's body in their teasers last night .. saying " Pictures from the case you have never seen before " . The two photos were graphic and very disturbing . One was of the side of her face and head / neck and you could clearly see the cord that was used to strangle her around her neck , and bruising on her face . This was so hideously awful , I could not believe it . How has this got to do with ANYTHING remotely related to Hollywood Entertainment ? Nothing ! They have dropped their level of dignity and values to a new low .. and it shows . This used to be THE premiere show to watch .. and it 's just garbage now . I will watch Access Hollywood from now on .  
1	  I never bothered to see this movie in theaters although I remember hearing the name over and over . I finally watched it this week and what a delight . For some reason , I was expecting it to not be very good so I was completely surprised when I sat down and stuck with it and then found myself completely pulled in . I read a lot of the other user comments and it impressed me how much people talk about her fighting in the ring , but what was wonderful about Diana is that she 's a true fighter in life . All she needs to do is find her place where she be who she is and the ring helps her to get there . A very intelligent story and I 'm amazed that this is the first time up for Michelle Rodriguez - what an excellent job she did . Adrian and her coach were also quite good . This film is a little rough around the edges , but it doesn't matter in the slightest . The story , the will , and the performances completely outweigh any flaws ( that usually come with indie filmmaking anyway ) . A compelling portrayal of a girl finding herself and triumphing over her circumstances and a K.O. for Michelle Rodriguez !  
1	  The time is the future and for many not aware of it , that day is now . In this final movie for legendary actor , Edward G. Robinson , " Solent Green " becomes a landmark classic . Many a film buff and environmentalist believe this is our eventual history . The movie is taken from the novel entitled , ' Make room , make room ' but who 's working title was changed to " Solent Green . " The story concerns the Earth as it evolves into the future with the world 's environmental problems becoming nothing short of Catastrophic . The planet 's natural resources have been exhausted and basic food has been reduced to simple staples . They come in a variety of colors , such as Solent Yellow , Solent Red , and now ' Solent Green . ' However there are those who know the ' real ' ingredient in Solent Green and cringe at their own culpability and fear divine retribution . The first is a food executive named William R. Simonson ( Joseph Cotton ) . Upon his death , a dedicated police detective called Robert Thorn ( Charleston Heston ) seeks the truth behind his apparent suicide . Although corruption goes all the way to the top , it begins with Simonsons ' Bodyguard , Tad Fielding ( Chuck Connors ) and Security chief Donnovan ( Roy Jenson ) who target Thorn for a Waste Desposal Factory . Thorn 's boss , Lt . Hatcher ( Brock Peters ) believes his suspicions but warns him of those ' Higher and Hot ' who want the case closed , but Thorn will not risk his " Job " for an easy way out . What Thorn discovers marks him for death , but like the film , awaits a final warning . *  
0	  First of all I would like to point out that this film has absolutely nothing to see with the Dutch folklore story of the ghost ship that is also called THE FLYING DUTCHMAN . In this film , you will not see a single sailing boat . You will not see sailors , ghosts , or anything remotely exciting . It is not the story of the ghost ship , and I wish they had notified it in the main credits or I wouldn't have watched it , because I really thought it was the film about the legend . It seems many people think the film has to do with the legend of the ghost ship , since the film is listed on the Wikipedia page for the " Flying Dutchman " legend .. I don't understand why . It is maybe based on the resembling legend called " The Wandering Jew " ? Or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend ? The film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes . Unfortunately , it is the only battle scene of the film . Then you see Daniel Emilfork ( who was Krank in City of Lost Children ) for about two seconds , and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting . Unfortunately he is very bad in the film . The same thing can be said about Italian actor Nino Manfredi , who was one of Italia 's best actors ever , and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the " wise man " of the film . And boy , does that film need wiseness ! Every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement , yelling , torturing others ( in excrement ) , fornicating ( in excrement ) or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it . It seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another . Coming from a Dutch director , you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece , elements which contributed to make Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven 's film , " Flesh + Blood " , such a great film . The thought of " Flesh + Blood " would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight-forward would be good . Unfortunately , and unlike " Flesh + Blood " , there is no dramatic progression , no fights , no good acting , and put simply , no " Flesh and Blood " . The photography , as the opening sequence unfolds , is well-done and enticing . This too , stops very early in the film . The music , from Nicola Piovani ( of " La vità e bella " fame ) is repetitive and annoying , when not irrelevant ( it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence , while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung ) . Throughout the first " act " of the film , which lasts nothing less than an hour ( ! ) , the film takes place within the same perimeter , which is around the farm where the main characters live . The characters play with excrement a lot , drown in it , play in it . A long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character , a young boy who loves to play in excrement , to become older and play in excrement some more . The bird-man talks a lot to say foolish things in Italian . Spanish conquistadors speak French . Nothing makes sense . Everything is confused and takes hours to happen . Then there is a second act called " the Ship " , in which we see what might have been a ship , a long time ago , but which is now remains of a ship ( covered with excrement did I mention ? ) . The main character , while walking a bit further away from the farm , just happens to run into it , and decides it 's really cool so let 's live in it . The hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him , but he doesn't really mind because ( did I mention ? ) he 's not very bright . He thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it , until more conquistadors show up ( at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the Don Quixote style hats but as I 've said it 's really confused who 's who ) , make the Dutchman a prisoner , along with the retarded hunchback , and they burn the ship to the ground . The last part of the film , which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle-age peasants fighting in it , takes place in a mad asylum . Yet more torture and drowning each other with feces . Yet more loitering for the director , who seems to have definitely given up on his job , or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job . In the end , a lot of the mentally-challenged new " friends " that the Dutchman made die . The woman he had sex with who was his brother 's wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son . The Dutchman and his son talk . The film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances . Then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends , while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don't have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses .  
1	  This Cecil B. DeMille epic of the old West contains what may be Jean Arthur 's finest performance , as a hysterical , eccentric , incurably amoral , but devotedly doting Calamity Jane . She really pulled it off ! Gary Cooper is at his most taciturn , but manages some occasional pithy sayings : ' The plains are big , but trails cross .. sometimes . ' The story is a pastiche to end all pastiches . All the cowboy heroes of Western lore seem to be in there somehow except for Jesse James . Even Abraham Lincoln opens the story in person ( or at least , DeMille would have us believe so ) . There is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety , this is a ' stomp ' em in the face ' tale for the masses . A remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what Eisenhower was eventually to name ' the military industrial complex ' . It isn't just a story about gun-runners , but about arming anyone for money , and doing so from the heart of Washington . But let 's not get into politics , let 's leave that to DeMille , who can be guaranteed to be superficial . The chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by George Antheil , who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography , ' Bad Boy of Music ' . Antheil seems to have originated ' the big sound ' adopted by all subsequent Westerns , whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky , celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies . That is why it does not sound at all unusual , because we have heard it a thousand times . But he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into American mythic lore , and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then , corny as it may be , but doubtless appropriate . It is amusing to see Anthony Quinn in an early appearance as a Cheyenne Indian . Gabby Hayes is in there somewhere , but you miss him in the crowd . Gary Cooper overtops them all , looming large , - but when did he ever loom small ?  
0	  Sorry , but I will spoil both the plot line and the ending for you in hopes of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one that I now face . The father dies and the mother asks Santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for Christmas , .. and Santa does . Dad is peachy , happy healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he had died . All ends syrupy sweet . But as a parent who recently watched my five year-old lose his best canine friend , it was a horror flick . Now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his buddy back is to ask Santa ! Do not underestimate the willpower of a young heart - no amount of persuasion will convince him that it was only a movie and that his dog is NOT coming back for Christmas . It has been heart breaking to watch his joy only to know that Christmas Eve he will have to face his loss afresh . Shame on you on behalf of all the believers that have lost a loved one recently . It is hard enough to deal with the loss one time for a child , but there are some wishes that we shouldn't even portray as a possibility .  
1	  To " Bend It Like Beckham " may not mean much to us Americans who know very little about the other football ( soccer ) , but to English sports fans , it is equivalent to " Hit it Like Bonds " or " Dunk it Like Jordan . " Any young soccer player dreams of bending a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal , much like star player David Beckham does , much like the young Indian girl , Jess ( Parminder Nagra ) , does in the film Bend It Like Beckham . Jess loves to play pick up soccer games , the kind forbidden by her traditionalist mother . However , while playing one day , a passing friend named Jules ( Keira Knightley ) sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling , all girls soccer team . After satisfying the coach Joe ( Jonathan Rhys-Meyers ) , she makes the team , something she knows her mother would not approve of . The movie is not about disobeying parents , but rather a girl doing what she wants to do , even if that goes against culture , not just the parents . There is humor thrown throughout the movie , especially when Jules ' mother thinks she 's a lesbian . The movie does resort to a bit of a cliché moment , as the big soccer game is the same day as Jess ' sister 's wedding , but it does not come off a cheesy , but rather fun and light . The soccer action looks good , so sports fans will enjoy it , and a story about girls growing up in a boy 's world , the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience . Bend It Like Beckham is not just about soccer , but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time , something that proves to be rather difficult .  
1	  An excellent and accurate film .. McGovern takes great pains to research and document his writing and it pays off . He is not afraid to tell the truth , even though it might draw unfavourable reviews and comments from some who like stories to be clean and sweet and glossy . Once again , McGovern brings in Christopher Eccleston , though not in as high a profile a role as he played in Hillsborough . I found this movie as accurate , well acted and well presented as Hillsborough and I applaud McGovern for his poignant unapologetic writing . Well done and my hat is off to the writer , the actors , the production crew . A great film !  
0	  For those who are too young to know this or for those who have forgotten , the Disney company went almost down the tubes by the end of the 1980s . People were NOT seeing their movies anymore and the company was not producing the usual wholesome material .. at least no what people expected . A major problem : profanity . Yes , the idiots running the Disney movies during that decade would produce films with swear words - including the Lord 's name in vain , if you can believe that - interspersed in these " family films . " In fact that happens twice here in the first 20 minutes ! This movie , in addition to the language problems , has a nasty tone to it , too , which made it unlikeable almost right from the beginning . Thankfully , Disney woke up and has produced a lot of great material since these decadent ' 80s movies . ( " Touchstone " is Disney , just under another name . )  
0	  An Inconvenient Truth is as entirely simplistic and demagogic as the turgid slop created by the rabid and idiotic Republicans , it meanders along intangible lines until it attempts to gorge something into your face , namely that we 'll all be dead in a few hundred years , which is already indisputable , but who cares , humans are selfish , destructive creatures , I frankly do not waste my time caring about human extinction . I 'll just call it a " natural progression " . Let the apocalypse begin , but meanwhile , we have to listen to the same brazen , slanted politicians who propose another " new society " , well , don't be fooled , we 'll all still be controlled by the wealthy , by those in power and by those idiots who created the catastrophes in the first place . Nothing will ever change . Al Gore , whose hypocrisy is quite evident in the film , as he is being driven in a gas guzzling car all alone using a consumerist computer , he also lives on huge acres of land in a rather large mansion , the land itself was used for destructive erosive purposes including cattle , tobacco , pig farming ( which accounts for methane gas traces ) and who knows what else , his wealth is predicated on exploitation , greed and his investments include numerous large companies in the world with disputable records . I hardly think this man is qualified to lecture the less fortunate , but his prestige is based on his opposition to another ludicrous political party , that is all , meanwhile he emits those very same rancid characteristics that make politics and politicians so appalling . This bozo happens to be living the comfortable life and yet he 's lecturing poor people in Africa about crop farming and cut and burn techniques ? He travels across the world in first class seats in fuel wasting jets , uses product placed computers in the documentary , and yet he thinks everything is a " moral issue " . He 's entirely absorbed in his own deluded nightmares , he says he came to these conclusions because of the death of his sister ( from tobacco induced cancer and the near death of his son by an automobile of all things ) . Did he fight against the tobacco companies or propose that automobiles be banned because they are dangerous hulking machines ? NO . Everything must serve the " economy " , so why is he any different , the answer is he is not . His forlorn and exhausted attempts at humanistic philosophy are disastrous , all this while he 's being filmed in the forest or along a little river eschewing stale life affirming quotes . Well Mr Gore , why don't you try living like the common people then ? He is a politician , plain and simple , he has a career invested in the power structure . My question is , why doesn't he concentrate on the powerful industrial nations of the earth who are to blame for most of the complications ? He doesn't do that because it would be unwise for " investments , stocks and corporations " . Al Gore gives monotonous lectures about the subject in the documentary , namely to wealthy white people in the audience , who clap on cue , while showing them graph charts , numbers and percentages , and speaking in a dreary tone , no one without a Harvard ( which the elites control ) education can make sense out of it , but he tells us everything is going to hell . No kidding , but I think he fails to account for this problem precisely in the approach that capitalism has taken for the planet , namely that it is expendable and a waste dump . He never once mentions how industrialization has created these problems , he just wants to put mild bandages on them but not eradicate the whole oppressive system . Its obvious he was spoiled , sent to the schools for elites and has the same basic temperament for politics as any other back stabbing , inconsistent dullard in Washington . Whoever made this propaganda , as it is in no way different than what the Republicans have conceived , had only goals in mind that were directed by capitalistic impulse . That is to say , someone is going to benefit , and it seems the " new green " politicians who support venture capitalist companies who are buying up hordes of land in an attempt to develop the " new Utopian future " with " new technologies " . It 's the same old story , Al Gore is a believer in the elitist structure , he actually believes there is a " democracy " in the US which I find very naive . If we aren't paying wages to the oil companies , then we 'll be paying them to the wind and solar companies . I find the speech at the end quite rancid , along the lines of something GW Bush would have oozed over to the dumb downed masses , Gore speaks about " people uniting together to defeat communism " in the 1990 's , what it had to do with global warming , absolutely nothing but he attempts to get base emotions ruminating in people . With that said , he didn't understand that communism never existed in the world , the systems in Europe and USSR were merely a tyrannical form of authoritarianism and capitalism , no less different than what controls the US interests . Social ecology was not even mentioned here , which is really a travesty . If you want to change the world , then one must dispose of those antiquated systems that are based on greed , exploitation and violence .  
1	  Peaceful rancher Robert Sterling is on the losing side of a range war with his ruthless neighbors , that is until notorious outlaw Robert Preston shows up out of the blue to level the playing field . Soon he begins to go too far , feeding a growing sense of unease in Sterling , especially when his son begins to idolize the wily criminal . The Sundowners is a tightly-paced , gritty , and surprisingly tough little picture with a great performance by Preston . Here , he comes across as an evil version of Shane , that is until the real nature of the rancher and the outlaw 's relationship is revealed . Most movie guides and video boxes spoil the surprise ! Rounding out the cast is Chill Wills , Jack Elam , and the debut of John Drew Barrymore , who became more famous for his offspring than his acting .  
1	  Any screen adaptation of a John Grisham story deserves a mainstream Hollywood approach , and Robert Altman is about the last director I would go to for a mainstream take on anything . But this southern-fried pot-boiler is pretty good . While it 's not among Altman 's best , it certainly isn't among the films he 's made that leave you scratching your head and wondering what he was thinking . Altman had tipped his hat to the mystery thriller with noir overtones before , in his 1973 film " The Long Goodbye . " " The Gingerbread Man " is nowhere near as good as that film , but it holds up fairly well on its own . Kenneth Branagh is a cocky attorney who finds himself framed for murder after he gets involved with a client ( Embeth Davidtz ) who has enlisted his help in protecting her from her cuckoo father ( Robert Duvall ) . The film is set in Savannah , Georgia during the approach of a tropical storm , which lends the film an oppressive atmosphere that I very much liked . The twists and turns toward the film 's end become clunkier and clunkier , and Altman proves himself to be not all that adept at staging shootouts , but overall the film is not a bad addition to Altman 's canon . Also starring Robert Downey , Jr. , Daryl Hannah , Tom Berenger and Famke Janssen . Grade : B  
0	  This movie is spoofed in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 . I think MST3K was at its best when they ripped this movie . Terrible acting , bad makeup , poor effects , chick in skimpy ( 1960 's ) underwear . I give it a 2 . The villain is hard to understand due to the makeup . The assistant says things like ' not you ' that sound like NACHOO ! ( think sneezing ) . It 's just poor oration . The long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters . I still don't know what ' The Projected Man ' means in terms of the plot . I missed some of the beginning though . What is up with this 10 line minimum on posting ?  
1	  When I first watched this , we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about 3 times . We 've just watched it again and I liked it MORE than I did the last time I 'd watched it ! :) :( ) The film is mainly about two dogs called Charlie and Itchy ( voiced by Dom DeLuise and I love Dom DeLuise ! ) . Charlie is half a gangster and half a goodie , which I like . Itchy is his sidekick . Charlie is killed by his friend ( NOT ) and sent to heaven . When Charlie comes back to life , it is the start of an amazing adventure . The five main reasons why I 'm absolutely CRAZY about this film : One : I love the characters ( except Carface ) . My favourite three are Charlie , Itchy and a little girl called Anne-Marie who comes slightly later . Two : I love the period of history in which this film is set . It is set during the prohibition in the United States . Three : The Don Bluth animation ( as usual ) is superb . The backgrounds are good too . Four : There is a strange excitement in this film that keeps me on the edge of my seat . Five : The songs in this are lovely . My favourite song starts with " I need Brazil , the throb , the thrill " .. So , watch this lovely film when you can , you won't be disappointed ! :) ;) :( )  
0	  All internet buzz aside , this movie was god awful . I expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything . Instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller / horror movie , and they completely missed . There were only a few good parts , and a couple good lines by Samuel Jackson . Other than that , it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes . All of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie . Now that the movie has actually come out , hopefully this joke will die . Don't waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash . If you 're looking for something that 's funny and entertaining , then just go to Snakes on a Blog .  
1	  This is one creepy movie . Creepier than anything David Lynch , and that shows what a great director Polanski is since this is not his usual type of work , and it is BRILLIANT . It all starts of with Trelkovski moves into a tenement block in Paris . He soon learns that the previous tenant , a young woman , committed suicide and he believes the rest of the people living there drove her to it . He also believes that they are trying to do the same to him . What results is a amazing and frightening look at paranoia . The whole production has classical horror written all over it : from the imagery to the music the viewer can feel poor Trelkovski 's terror building up . Are they all out to kill him ? Or maybe just drive him mad ? Is there a difference ? Find out for yourself . 10/10  
1	  One of my favorite Twilight Zone episodes . And the next day we were in the supermarket at Hollywood Blvd . and La Brea , my father and I , and guess who was coming toward us in the aisle ! Barney Phillips , but no hat on - at least , I don't think he had a hat on . We asked him about his third eye , and he said something like he left it at home , and everybody he met that day had asked him about it . A friendly guy . We used to see all kinds of character actors in LA in those days . BTW , I was a teenager and it took a long time for me to get over the " three hands " on the other alien !

1	  Until today I had never seen this film . Its was filmed on the sets of the Old Dark House and Frankenstein and concerns a small Bavarian village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the blood of the villagers . Frankly its a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and a cast that won't quit , Lionel Atwill , Dwight Frye , Faye Wray and Melvin Douglas playing a character named Brettschnieder which is of interest to me since that was my great grandmother 's maiden name . This is a carefully modulated film that has suspense and witty one liners that slowly builds for its brief running time , only going astray when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything up . From that point to the end its a straight run to the finish with very little of the fun that preceded it . Leonard Maltin and IMDb list a running time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints . The trouble is that IMDb and Maltin can be wrong , and in this case I think they are since a source I trust more says the full running time is 67 minutes ( The Overlook Film Encyclopedia ) Quibbling about this I know is insane but since most prints that are available tend to run around 60-63 minutes the amount of missing material is considerably less if its only 67 minutes long . Personally I think it won't matter that much since its at most five minutes and I doubt very much it will make or break the film . What ever the running time , if you like creaky old films , do , by all means do , watch this movie , its a great dark and stormy night film .  
1	  We showed this movie at the local Film Society , and the art-house crowd had the time of their cinematic lives . It 's tasteless , groovy and very funny in a sixties kind of way . The Kraft Kitchen recipe sketch had them laughing like maniacs . The rest is a mixed bag , but the highs definitely beat the lows . By the way , whatever happened to Ken Shapiro ?  
0	  The viewer leaves wondering why he bothered to watch this one , or why , for that matter , anyone bothered to make it . There is no plot - just random scenes of ridiculous action . Mia Sara 's shower scene appeals to the male libido , but that 's not much reason to make a movie .  
1	  Grey Gardens is a world unto itself . Edith and Little Edie live in near total isolation , eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their ( apparently ) shared bedroom . Cats loll about while mother Edith insults her daughter 's elocution . This is a Tennessee Williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights , as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100 % real . The situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her 50-ish daughter lived for a decade ( other than that they were poor and clean ) . They would bicker all day , grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men , work , and self-expression . This film is a must-see for anyone writing a mother / daughter relationship of this kind . It is sad and voyeuristic , but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the Edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly . It is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context-remnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion .  
0	  This is one of the worst films ever . I like cheesy movies but this is simply awful . Where are the images in the film that are on the box ? I think more money was spent on the DVD box illustrations than on the entire film . Why would a company release a DVD that the cover is so misleading ? I feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box . As much as I explore IMDb I should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store . I have no one to blame except myself . I want my money and time back . DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE . Even if curiosity is motivating you , stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead . It will be much more enjoyable . You have been warned !  
1	  Domestic Import was a great movie . I laughed the whole time . It was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations . The acting was great . Alla Korot , Larry Dorf , Howard Hesseman , and all the others did an awesome job . Because it is an independent film written by a first-time writer , it doesn't have the clichés that are expected of other comedies , which was such a relief . It was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart-warming story . I heard it was based on a true story ? If so , then that is hilarious ( and amazing ! ) . I highly recommend this movie .  
0	  What do you call a horror story without horror and story ? This is the most irritating thing about the film : I get the feeling the writers never really decided what 's actually going on in the film ! It 's a different thing to know it , give hints for the audience and not completely reveal it , but here , you get the feeling the screenwriters don't know it , characters in the film do not know it and audience sees that no one knows ! ( Remember " Cube " ? Even that film knew more about itself . ) I 've consumed a lot of 80 's horror / gore films and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those films . But a lot of important things are missing . We really know nothing about the characters . They keep repeating empty lines over and over again . The story isn't really developing - it never goes anywhere . B-acting is OK in this type of horror films , but there 's not much to act in the script . We don't care about the characters . There 's nothing to remember about them . There 's not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex . And most importantly - no thrills , no chills . You only get some commonly used elements of the horror film genre . They show the Lordi monsters one by one but their characters don't really contribute anything for the story . I honestly believe that this amount of story , character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal amount of crew and equipment . Oh yeah , film makers used to do that - and more - some 20 years ago ! I felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the film ended . Too bad really .  
0	  How can they from Joe Don Baker ( as Bufford Pusser in the first sequel ) to Bo Svenson ( as Bufford Pusser in the second sequel ) . Why did they do that for . Just Because Bo Svenon look more a like to Bufford Pusser they still should'nt of changed it because the first sequel it was Joe Don Baker as Bufford Pusser and that one of the thing i wanted to see in the second sequel . I would 've given this movie a 7 out of 10 and i would 've given it a 1 out of 10 if the story did'nt have anything to do with Bufford Pusser 's life but it did and that why i had given this movie a 3 out 10 . I strongly suggest that anyone who is planning on watching this cheese i suggest don't and watch the first sequel instead .  
1	  The fully rounded character of the principal role of this movie , that of the cop torn up by his past and on a path of self-destruction so clear to the viewer , is unique for its time , 1950 . Along with the haunting music and the well written plot , the film is a prime example of film noir at its best . Close-ups of Dana 's eyes reveal the anguish within , Karl Malden excels as his boss , who brooks no nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the precinct . Otto Preminger made this type of movie just about his own . If there is any fault it would be with the breath taking beauty of Gene Tierney who seems oddly out of place with the hardened cop . Their scenes in the cafe , however , are wonderful and ring true . Tom Tully , in the bit part of her father is perfect as is Gary Merrill as the hood . Great lighting and mood setting . The building where the deadly deeds take place highly atmospheric , I love the old woman in the basement . 8 out of 10 .  
1	  With the release of Peter Jackson 's famed " Lord of the Rings " trilogy , it is even easier to dismiss Ralph Bakshi 's 1978 animated Lord of the Rings film as inferior . I agree with the majority that Jackson 's trilogy is the essential film adaptation of Tolkien 's work , but that does not prevent me from enjoying Bakshi 's ambitious pioneering effort . Jackson has admitted that he received at least some inspiration from seeing Bakshi 's film and there are some clear similarities between their adaptations . The film 's colorful picturesque backdrops are excellent and the score is memorable . I was for the most part satisfied by the drawings of the characters . The pairs of Pippin and Merry and Eowyn and Galadriel are mostly indistinguishable from each other visually , the Balrog and Treebeard were unimpressive , but these points didn't bother me very much . However , the Nazgul are aptly drawn and made sufficiently eerie . The only character representation I was bothered by was Sam 's ; he was made to look unbecomingly silly . This film is novel for its animation techniques . In addition to hand-drawn characters , live actors are incorporated into the animation through rotoscoping . It is quite apparent which characters are hand-drawn and which are rotoscoped , but none the less I found that the film 's style was a novelty . The use of rotoscoped live actors for the battle scenes was a good decision and helped these scenes turn out well . The voice acting was generally of high quality . Particularly good was John Hurt , who provided an authoritative voice for Aragorn . Aragorn isn't a favorite character of mine from the stories , but backed by John Hurt 's voice he was my favorite character in this adaptation . My other favorite was William Squire , whose voice is appropriately strong for Gandalf . The only actor who seemed inappropriate was Michael Scholes as Sam , whose voice acting was irritating and added to Sam 's unfortunately silly image . The only other bothersome part of the voice acting is the mispronunciation of character and place names . Particularly strange was the decision to frequently have Saruman referred to as " Aruman " . In producing this film , Ralph Bakshi expected to have the ability to produce two films . Hence , this film contains about half the story , from the start of " The Fellowship of the Ring " to the end of the battle at Helm 's Deep in " The Two Towers " . The obvious implication of this is that the film 's story is a highly condensed version of the story from the books . I enjoy the original stories and more thorough adaptations , but the liberties taken to compress the story didn't bother me , even the choice to leave Arwen out of the story . Enough of the key elements of the story were in this film to keep me engaged for the duration and there was even a novelty in being able to breeze through half the Lord of the Rings story in 132 minutes . The battle scenes were impressive and in particular the orc march to and battle at Helm 's Deep were tremendous . Ralph Bakshi 's version of " The Lord of the Rings " isn't perfect and no doubt a number of Lord of the Rings readers lament the cuts to the story . However , for me the drawbacks of this film were minor compared to the thrill of seeing an effective adaptation of half of a great trilogy . My only strong lament is that I am unable to see the second part of this " first great tale " of The Lord of the Rings since Bakshi was not given the budget to create a sequel .  
1	  I 'm 60 years old , a guitarist , ( lead / rhythm ) , and over the last forty years , I 've been in four bands , it 's all there , the fights , the foul-ups , the rotten food , the worse accommodation , always travelling , little or no money , and every one was drunk or high . But , the clubs , the fans , and the music , made it all worth it ! Just like Strange Fruit ! I 'm too damn old for it now , and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking , but for the length of that video , it all came back , and it was all there ! The birds , the brawls , and the booze ! And I was young again ! It 's just like Billy Connolly 's voice over , God likes that 70 's stuff ! Rock On Forever !  
0	  * May Contain Spoilers * A dude in a dopey-looking Kong suit ( the same one used in KING KONG VS . GODZILLA in 1962 ) provides much of the laffs in this much-mocked monster flick . Kong is resurrected on Mondo Island and helps out the lunkhead hero and other good guys this time around . The vampire-like villain is named Dr. Who-funny , he doesn't look like Peter Cushing ! Kong finally dukes it out with Who 's pride and joy , a giant robot ape that looks like a bad metal sculpture of Magilla Gorilla . Like many of Honda 's flicks this may have had some merit before American audiences diddled around with it and added new footage . The Rankin / Bass animation company had a hand in this mess . They should have stuck to superior children 's programs like The Little Drummer Boy .  
0	  This movie is yet another in the long line of no budget , no effort , no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video store . If you want to know what watching this movie is like , grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and " attacking " people . Congratulations , you 've just made " Hood of the Living Dead " ! Now see if a distribution company will buy it from you . I have seen some low budget , shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort , but this has neither . Avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movies .  
1	  Beautiful and touching movie . Rich colors , great settings , good acting and one of the most charming movies I have seen in a while . I never saw such an interesting setting when I was in China . My wife liked it so much she asked me to log on and rate it so other would enjoy too .  
0	  I read about this movie in a magazine and I was intrigued . A woman , who one day sees herself drive past in her own car . Well , I thought , this could be interesting .. .. but it isn't . First , the title . The Broken ? The Broken .. what ? What is broken ? The .. oh , wait .. I get it , the title itself is " broken " ! WOW , clever ! Unfortunately , this is virtually the only thing going for it . The premise is not that bad , but I think Kiefer Suderland did much better in ' Mirrors ' . A cross between Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Mirrors , and a rather mediocre one at that . A more suited title would be ' The Boring ' , since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages . Or maybe ' The Confusing ' since it doesn't explain anything at all , not in the narrative nor in the story itself , only some vague idea about evil copies and somesuch , dotted with cheap scares and scenes used to death , but nothing tangible . It 's just messed up . On the other hand , the acting and the special effects are quite good , but then again , it 's not a difficult role to act . After watching the movie twice , I still feel unsatisfied , a little confused maybe , and not in the E. A. Poe or Stephen King kind of way . Do yourself a favor , and don't watch this one . Simply put , there are better thrillers out there .  
1	  With all the " Adult " innuendos in todays family movies its nice to see one where you don't have to worry about that and can just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids . Yes , this movie might have a few swear-words ( there 's that time where Knox swears , but they don't let you hear the full words ) , but for the most part this movie is truly as clean as they come ( and that 's including movies from back in the day ) . Not only that , its very enjoyable , one of my favorites , and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the family . The only thing I have against this movie is that it is too short and I wish there could be more of some of the memorable parts that are in it , I 'm not going to mention them because I don't want any spoilers here . All in all nicely done and a great movie to watch ; so go out and get the kids , make some cookies , and watch this movie !  
0	  I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old . My mom bought it at our local Kmart because it was on sale for $ 5 on VHS . She thought that it would be a nice Christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch . This movie , however , scared the hell out of me . You may be asking yourself , how could a movie about Santa Clause scare anyone ? The plot of the movie revolves around Satan sending one his minions , Pitch , to earth in an attempt to kill Santa and ruin Christmas . That 's right , Satan sends a demon up from hell to kill Santa Clause . Pitch stalks Santa throughout Christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on Christmas day , for if Santa doesn't make it back to his home in space , he turns to powder . Don't get me wrong , the movie is funny and fairly entertaining , however , the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell ( which occurs at the beginning of the movie ) is just downright creepy .  
1	  it 's all very simple . Jake goes to prison , and spends five years with the con and the chess masters . they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure , and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks . they decide to give Jake the ultimate freedom : from his innermost fears , from what he believes to be himself . for that , they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear , all the pride , all the hope - to be reborn as true master of his will . it 's a clever movie about the journey of illumination , about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves . 10/10 , no doubt .  
0	  Would have better strengthened considerably by making it as a 50 minute episode of the Outer Limits . Too much superfluous material and stuff like the chief bad guy looking like he 'd escaped from The Phantom of the Opera didn't help . The whole ' Night of the Living Dead ' sequence was extremely silly and quite unnecessary . After all , if the dead were to punish anyone for their sins , now remind me exactly who was killing everyone again ?  
1	  THE 40 YEAR-OLD VIRGIN ( 2005 ) * Steve Carell , Catherine Keener , Paul Rudd , Romany Malco , Seth Rogen , Elizabeth Banks , Leslie Mann , Jane Lynch , Gerry Bednob , Shelley Malil , Kat Dennings . Hysterically funny high-concept comedy about the titular Andy Stitzer ( wonderfully played by perennial second banana Carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the A-list ) , a tech services rep for an electronics store in Southern California who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co-worker buddies ( Rudd , Malco & Rogen , each one degree funnier than the next ) determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost . What follows is an unlikely yet very warm-hearted romance with a vivacious mother ( the marvelous Keener having lots of fun here ) leading to add more fuel to the fires within Andy . A surprisingly good-spirited and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy ; the funniest since " There 's Something About Mary " with a shrewdly observant script by director Judd Apatow and Carell that features some astoundingly gut-busting sequences including a scathingly accurate David Caruso joke , homophobic debunking ribbing , send-ups of ' date-a-paloozas ' and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb . A true winner and an instant classic ; the funniest film of the year .  
1	  Sherman , set the wayback machine for .. 1986 . The United States was just climbing out of its worst postwar recession , while Japan was enjoying an unprecedented industrial boom . Manufacturing industries were still a significant part of the US economy , and factory workers were a good example of the " average American " . The word " downsizing " hadn't entered the general vocabulary yet , but everyone knew the phenomenon . Bruce could be heard on the radio singing , " Foreman says these jobs are going , boy , and they ain't coming back to your hometown . " Chrysler had just been bailed out by Uncle Sam . Bumper stickers could be seen saying " Buy American - the job you save may be your own . " " Gung Ho " does a better job of capturing the mood of the American industrial workforce than just about any other popular movie made during that period . Certainly the movie has its flaws - some loose plot threads and mediocre acting jobs by everyone except Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe . But the story really is about the meeting of East and West : Keaton 's Hunt Stevenson personifies America , brash and confident on the outside yet insecure underneath . Watanabe 's Kazuhiro personifies Japan , on top of the heap with a successful system , but wondering if there is more to be learned from their Western rivals . The movie 's plot , flawed as it is , simply provides a framework for the conflict , and eventually synthesis , of their two personalities . Keaton 's acting overshadows everyone else 's , and practically makes the movie by itself . I 've always admired Keaton for his ability to deliver lines that feel improvised , no matter what script he 's following . His character , Hunt Stevenson , is a likable , affable everyman , a natural leader with a wise-ass streak . But he has a fatal flaw common to many of us : he doesn't want to disappoint anyone . He 'll distract the crowd with inspirational anecdotes , and even lie , rather than point out the ugly truth . Kazuhiro is the mirror image of Stevenson : shy and introspective , but also , because of his Japanese upbringing , reluctant to be the bearer of bad news . The scene in which Stevenson first comes to Kazuhiro with the employees ' grievances captures perfectly the Japanese approach to workplace conflict . Kazuhiro replies to Stevenson 's complaints with " I understand what you are saying , " but won't refuse his requests out loud . Stevenson misinterprets this as agreement , and goes away saying , " Okay , we 've got that settled . " ( This is still a problem in Japanese-American business relations in the 21st century ! ) Ultimately , Kazuhiro and Stevenson have the same problem : get the factory working smoothly , meet production goals , and fulfill their responsibility to the workers under them . In working towards this goal , they each have to take a page from the others ' book . Kazuhiro 's family becoming more " Americanized " is an obvious example . Also note that Stevenson thinks it 's odd when Kazuhiro explains how he had to make a public apology to his workers for failing them - and yet , later in the movie , Stevenson does exactly that himself . The plot and its resolution are a little cornball , but hey , this is a comedy . If you can overlook the movie 's flaws , there is a great story about self-realization and open-mindedness here .  
1	  Father and son communicate very little . IN fact they speak different languages . BUt when the son drives his father 3000 miles for his pilgrimage 's to Mecca , the conversations finally take place . they are difficult and growth is necessary on both parts . This movie takes us into the hearts of these two travelers , and it is indeed a grand voyage for the audience as well as the two principals . The imagery throughout is impressive , especially the final scenes in Mecca . It underlines for me once again how much different the world can be , but also at the same time , how similar . The same was true for the father and son in this film . See this movie . Tell your friends to see it . You 'll be glad you did .  
0	  I saw this movie a few days ago .. what the hell was that ? I like movies with Brian O'Halloran , they are funny and enjoyable . When I saw a name of this title and genre I thought great , this one could be really good .. some parody for slashers or another gore movies .. but .. then i read a preview and thought right it could be good anyway .. but it wasn't .. my opinion : if like movies they look little bit like documentary , with little bit of comedy try some Moore 's movies or Alien autopsy , they are really about something . this one was empty . and put A comedy to title .. no comment .. really bad joke  
0	  After just 15 minutes into this film , I began to miss Zhang Yimou 's earlier , more weighty films that looked at the politics and society of China from unique perspectives . His turn to martial arts films was a serious misstep in my humble opinion . Hero was his worst film since Operation Cougar , with a needlessly complex story and acting more wooden than that found in a John Agar film . Shi Mian Mai Fu is no different . As an American who has been studying Chinese films for a few years now ( and understands and can speak some Mandarin ) , I 'm sure my opinion is different from many others as I 'm coming from a different background . SMMF , like Hero , is not really a traditional a kung fu film , and it 's certainly not a wuxia pian film . There are no sword & sorcery or chivalry elements here . This is a completely different vehicle than infinitely more watchable films such as A Chinese Ghost Story ( all 3 ) , The Butterfly Murders , Green Snake , et al. While those all featured charismatic leads who looked like they were actually enjoying what they do , SMMF features bland , and sometimes laughable , dialogue combined with cardboard acting . Zhang Ziyi plays a blind person about as well as Ben Affleck . There 's an air of superiority with this film that 's really quite insulting . It takes itself so seriously , it just becomes a huge joke by the end . All the actors look as though this is the most important piece of celluloid in history , they destroy any chance of actually conveying emotions , and the complete humorlessness of it really makes you wonder if Zhang Yimou was making a film per se , or simply a showcase ( i.e. an " ego booster " ) for Zhang Ziyi . The camera is literally making out with her face and she gets sexually assaulted not once but twice in the film . Her acting range really hasn't extended past her ability to play a naive " w " itch . She 's so concentrated on her acting , she comes across as cold and lifeless , as though she 's reading her lines from a notecard . It 's so funny to hear American critics and film people ( like the completely clueless Quentin Tarantino ) call this film a masterpiece . I guess if they see a bunch of Asian actors on screen looking really important while flying through a bamboo forest , they 're tricked into thinking it 's brilliant film-making . Ching Siu Tung 's choreography , while still retaining his trademark style , editing , and postures , lacks the vitality and originality of his earlier films like A Chinese Ghost Story , Dragon Inn , and Duel to the Death . Sadly to say , the wirework in this film is really subpar , and if there 's subpar / obvious wirework , then you probably shouldn't have filmed it at high speed . The same goes for the special effects which have a distinct B-movie feel to them . Beans , daggers , bowls , arrows , swords , and other random objects fly through the air ( after being thrown ) with no regard for logic , turning , climbing , and banking as though there 's a little pilot inside . I know that logic doesn't really hold a place in stylized Chinese martial arts films , but if you don't want to induce a mass amount of giggling from your audience , then you should probably work on your compositing a bit more . Mass melodrama , unintentionally funny dramatic moments , boring fight scenes , really uninspired plot twists are what await you with Shi Mian Mai Fu . It 's obvious that Zhang Yimou is no longer making movies for Chinese audiences . This is meant to crack into the Western market just as CTHD did . After watching Hero and SMMF , I 've come to the conclusion that if Zhang Yimou wants to make Hollywood films , he 's definitely off to the right start . SMMF is basically The Phantom Menace of Chinese martial arts films . And I thought Hero was bad .  
0	  From the first moment , this " thing " is just an awful sequence of extremely short cuts of blurry camera work . While the overall plot has every potential for a thriller , the story is so badly told that I 'm unable to buy it . From the middle of the film , the actions of characters don't make sense to me . Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS . For instance , Ed 's idea to have Edna make coffee for them after having shot off her son 's arm is way below his alleged experience ; it 's just an extremely stupid idea . Domino not questioning the fragmentary orders she receives from Claremont Williams over a breaking-up phone connection just eludes me ; shouldn't she be long suspicious that Williams is turning them in ? Those FBI agents seem out of their minds showing up with just one single helicopter to something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shoot-out . Besides , what they do by withholding and leaking information towards Cigliutti is pretty much incitement to murder ; it seems to me like farewell to justice if that 's they way the FBI does investigations . In reality , they 'd have a case messed up beyond repair if they acted like this . We get to see a car accident which normally would have at least seriously injured if not killed most of the passengers but miraculously leaves all of them with just a few bruises . Quite the contrary , the accident is immediately followed by Domino making love to Choco , which is from Domino 's viewpoint in no way founded by previous events but just by being drugged to the eyeballs . The whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call of Claremont Williams appears to me just as want-to-be dramatic razzle-dazzle . This combined with the awful , uneasy camera work just makes a piece I hesitate to call a movie . I 'm sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors , whose talent is out of question .  
0	  It kept my attention to the end , however , without spoiling the film for anyone .. when she fixed the fridge by getting a book from the library , you knew how the film would end when she went back to library for a book on self defence against and assassin . The film , for me , said nothing of worth .. is becoming an assassin really a remedy for mental illness or just another symptom .  
0	  ( BIG SPOILERS ) I 've seen one other Takashi Miike film , and that was the very disturbing and brutal ' Audition ' , which was an examination of the Japanese ideals of femininity ! In ' Visitor Q'- which I think means ' Visitor Question '- he examines , in a very disturbingly gross way , the family unit . Miike 's surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be Lynchian in terms of confusion and film-making , but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue . We , the audience , are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure ( Kenichi Endo - who was actually quite good ) paying for sex with his displaced daughter ( Fujiko ) . Then , as the father returns home , he is struck on the head by " the visitor " ( Kazushi Watanabe ) wielding a fairly sizeable rock , and for some reason , they both end up back at the family home . The mother ( Shungiku Uchida ) is beaten and bullied by her son ( Jun Muto ) who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers . When the visitor enters the home , he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit . Eventually , the family begin to improve their relationship , with assistance from the visitor , through milking breasts , murder and retaining a sense of family pride . And there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together . It 's has uncomfortable humour , but is equally frustratingly silly , and over-the-top in its weirdness . There is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting , but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses . Partly because of the situation itself , and partly because you can't believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this ! The style of the film is poor to say the least , and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak . The characters themselves are all over the place , and while I understand this is not meant to be realistic , there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd ! The camera-work is sloppy , and doesn't have that cinematic feel that Lynch 's work entails . It 's hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level , or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in Japan . It just seems that Miike was out to shock , and the film seems self-aware that it 's " trying " to be shocking , and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously . All in all , I would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy , but it looks and feels amateurish , and seems to unnecessarily want to shock . Miike 's previous film , Audition , was finely balanced between disgusting horror , character development and technique - which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot . ' Visitor Q ' is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting , without really having much to say in the process ! * out of * !  
0	  My personal vision of hell is being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this movie play for eternity on every available surface in that room . The whole notion that Streisand plays a boy / man only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise this movie is . The single most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of " willing suspension of disbelief " . . . it is impossible to do that in this movie .  
1	  I don't know if this is a sitcom or not , but I agree that this is one of the greatest television shows ever . It 's great that this show still airs . And I love Michelle . It 's cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she talked , and she sometimes said something funny . Aw . This show can relate to children and teens and .. well , families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family . I don't know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone . I love the episode when I think her name is DD .. the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt , and she learned a lesson about stealing . That was a great episode . An example that this TV show shows the family working things out as a family . I recommend this show for everyone .  
0	  There have been many movies featuring Bigfoot , the majority of which are not good but most at least have a goofy charm to them . Sasquatch Hunters doesn't even have that going for it . It 's just a crashing bore . Sasquatch Hunters is about a group of paleontologists , primatologists , and forest rangers that venture off into a remote part of a Pacific Northwest forest . Bones belonging to some sort of abnormally large primate have been discovered in this region and since apes aren't natural to North America to begin with this leads to a scientific expedition . Sure enough , they soon discover a whole burial ground full of the skeletal remains of these enormous ape-like creatures . I think we all know what happens to people that disturb ancient burial grounds in the movies . The first half of the movie consists of uninteresting , interchangeable characters assembling their gear , hiking through the woods , stopping to rest , hiking through the woods some more , pausing long enough to investigate and discuss a few findings along the way , yet more hiking through the woods , looking for a group member that has vanished , even more hiking through the woods , digging through dirt , random theorizing , and gathering around a campfire to discuss what little they 've done that day . When Sasquatch finally shows up it just turns into people stumbling around in the dark while being picked off one at a time ( done in a blink and you missed it fashion and the actual killing occurs off-camera ) . All of this is excruciatingly boring . The movie wants to be taken seriously and the director is clearly trying to build suspense but there is none to be found , thus we are left with dull , drawn out scenes of people wandering around the woods just to get somewhere and wander around the woods at night trying to act scared . I 'd be lying if I said I didn't make liberal use of the fast forward button to speed these scenes up . As for Sasquatch himself , much like every other character else in the movie , it doesn't have much to do and lacks a distinct personality . It looks like a shaggier version of King Kong , which isn't all that bad except in the scenes where they used CGI instead of a man in a Bigfoot costume , which is painfully obvious during the daylight monster scenes . A part of me can't help but feel that even using computer effects to bring Bigfoot to life is a tad sacrilegious . If there is any single movie monster that I believe should only be brought to life through situation , it 's Bigfoot . This is one of those movies that doesn't so much have a plot as it does a premise . That 's all it really is , a premise , which the people involved stretched out to make a feature length motion picture without bothering to add all the ingredients to make a worthwhile movie .  
1	  Maybe I 'm a sap but this is the sweetest movies ever ! I saw it for the first time when I was around 4 or 5 , and I cried my eyes out . Between then and now ( embarrassed at age 15 ) I have seen it over 25 times and have sobbed each and every one of them . Don't worry they 're tears of happiness ! And it 's not all sap ! There 's a lot of humor and comedy in it too . Usually the whole talking animal thing can be a huge drag but in this movie it 's not the case . My only word of advice : Even if you love this-Don't see the sequal .. cornyness ! I suggest everyone checks this out .. you won't be sorry , no matter how old or young you are !  
0	  I really looked forward to see Planet of the Apes , but it was a huge dissapointment . The settings and masks are great , but that is the only good aspect of the film . All other things are really annoying . Mark Wahlberg is not acting , he is just in the movie , looking stupid . The other actors are also not very good . But the worst point of all , is the story . It is absolutely ridiculous ! For example : the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground , but the humans don ` t attack them , no , they wait until they are up again ! This is just one example for the stupid story , but it would take too long to tell them all .  
1	  I am not a usual commenter on this website but seeing how underrated this movie is , I endeavour myself to write some comments and remarks about it . I had fun watching this movie , perhaps because Cat is everything I wish I could be , I am not going to post spoilers or reveal plots but there 's are things that i really found amazing , the way she manipulates people it 's just so divine . this is a very underrated movie , I lack of arguments here , I usually go enjoy and then speak little about it , when you go to the movies is to have fun , and i really enjoyed the 1h53 i stayed in the dark room . a must seen over and over again until the delight fades away . let 's try not be so critical about it . thank you for reading .  
1	  While I had wanted to se this film since the first time I watched the trailer , I was in for a deep surprise with this film . While some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too cartoonish , ' the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience . Instead of the feel good happy story , this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting , but also disturbing . Most kids won't understand some of the darker moments in the film , which makes this film rather watchable for adults . I was also impressed with the cinematography , using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts . The musical score was once again solid , proving Hans Zimmer is the go-to guy when it comes to animated scores , and I never thought I would say I actually enjoyed Brian Adams ' music .  
0	  " Loonatics Unleashed " is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones . The " Loony Tunes " have many spin - offs and different versions , some were good , others not very much . But " Loonatics " it 's the worst . The concept is stupid and derivative of shows as " The Power Rangers " and " Teen Titans " . There wasn't any similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made . The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic . This show just doesn't work . This horrible waste of animation is a complete failure and this shouldn't have be nothing more than a bad joke . Lame ! Zero stars  
1	  First off ; I 'm a dedicated fan of Modesty 's , and have been reading the comics since I was a child , and I have found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfying , but where they fail , this one ROCKS ! Well then , here we go : Ms Blaise is working for a casino , a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends lives . If the robber wins one round , she 'll have to tell him about herself . If she wins two times in a row , one of the staff members goes free . ( Sounds stupid , yeah , well , I 'm not that good at explaining either .. ) ;) She tells him about growing up in a war zone , without parents or friends , about her helping an old man in the refugee camp and how they escape , living by nature 's own rules . They hunt for food , and he teaches her to read and fight . As they approach civilization they get caught up in a war , and as they are taken for rebellions , they are being shot at and the old man dies , which leaves her to meet the city by herself . Then she meets the man who 's casino she 's now working for , and there the story ends . What is to follow is that there 's an awesome fight and the line 's are totally cool . Alexandra Staden is a TERRIFIC Modesty Blaise ! Just as modest and strong , graceful and intellectual as the comic-one . Feels awkward though , too hear Modesty speak with a slightly broken accent , but that 's not relevant since the comic book - blaise can't speak out loud , but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent . ( Not to mention that it 's weird everybody 's speaking English in the Balkan .. ) The acting is really good , even the child who personifies the young Blaise must have a applaud ! My favorite part must be where she rips up her dress to kick the stupid robber 's ass ! Totally awesome ! :D I can't wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie / s ! Watch it , you won't be disappointed !  
1	  If you loved Deep Cover , you might like this film as well . Many of the poetic interludes Fishburne recites in Deep Cover are from the lyrical script of " Once In the Life , " a screen adaptation of a play that Fishburne wrote . If you love Larry as much as I do , you 'll love this film that is all Larry , all hot , and all fleshed out . Of course there is gun play and illicit substance use , this is a gangster movie of sorts , after all , but the script is beautiful and the story is touching , even a little on the chick flick side . AMAZING film .. dark , frightening , sexy , and exciting . If you ever sneaked out at night or hung out in a clubhouse , you 'll get the proper impact of the cramped sets ( metephorically echoing being trapped in the life ) . Full of clever foreshadowing and complex relationships , this film is tight .. every sentiment mirrored in the set dressing and camera shots . GOOD WORK !  
1	  For the life of me , why did this film receive an R rating ? ! While it IS about flesh-eating zombies , believe it or not , it 's actually a pretty good family-friendly film-at least if your kids are age 10 and older . Unlike the traditional zombie films , this one has an excellent sense of humor as well as a traditional values-albeit a bit twisted ! The language isn't a serious problem , there is no nudity and the film style is definitely geared towards kids ( much like the old TV show " Eerie , Indiana " ) - yet some knucklehead slapped an R rating one it ! Believe me , most kids have seen worse violence than this and it just seems silly to make audiences think this is an adults only film . The story is set in a parallel-type world . While the fashions , cars and mores appear circa 1953 , in this bizarro world there has been a fierce recent zombie plague that resulted in the " zombie war " and massive changes in everyday life . At school , kids are trained in armed combat and there 's a cute scene late in the film where the father gives his son a handgun and tells him to keep it in his backpack " just in case " ! As for life outside of school , it 's pretty weird as well , as people now have learned that zombies AREN'T such a bad thing ! Heck , using shock collars and training , they can be made into slaves who can do your housework , clean streets , deliver milk or , in the case of a really sick guy , be your " special friend " . This film deals with one particular family that finally buys their first zombie slave ( played by Billy Connally ) . Mom is thrilled and her son slowly becomes the zombie 's friend . Dad , on the other hand , isn't convinced-as he was forced years early to kill his own zombie father and he hasn't yet gotten over this ! Funny , irreverent and unique-this film needs to be seen by a much wider audience .  
0	  He only gets third billing ( behind Arthur Treacher & Virginia Field ) , but this was effectively David Niven 's first starring role and he 's charmingly silly as P. G. Wodehouse 's dunderheaded Bertie Wooster , master ( in name only ) to Jeeves , that most unflappable of valets . As an adaptation , it 's more like a watered-down THE 39 STEPS than a true Wodehousian outing . And that 's too bad since the interplay between Treacher & Niven isn't too far off the mark . Alas , the ' B ' movie mystery tropes & forced comedy grow wearisome even at a brief 57 minutes . Next year 's follow-up ( STEP LIVELY , JEEVES ) was even more off the mark , with no Bertie in sight and Jeeves ( of all people ! ) forced to play the goof .  
0	  Woody Allen , when at his best , has one of the sharpest pens around . He can make an acute observation and wrap it around a punch line like nobody else . However , when he 's at his worst his movies can stench of pretentiousness . Unfortunately , " Melinda and Melinda " has this stench from opening to closing . The set up is one of his more intriguing ideas in a while . Four friends sit in a restaurant discussing whether the essence of life is comedy or drama . To help settle the argument , one man relates the beginning of a story and asks the two other men arguing ( one a comic playwright , the other a dramatic playwright ) whether the story is a comedy or a tragedy . The two men then continue the story and the movie plays out the stories that they weave . Now , when I first heard about this film , my understanding was that they tell the exact same story , the genre ( comedy or drama ) only changes by how you look at it . Now that would have been interesting . However , the stories only share one main element and a few side elements . They are entirely different stories with major plot differences . The drama is so stiffly scripted and pretentious that it can only really work as self-parody . If this was the point , then it failed because these elements prevent the audience from feeling any emotional investment in any of the characters . The comedy is the story that has moments of success , but they are still short and fleeting . Will Farrell is obviously meant to be the stand-in for Woody , but he could have played this character so much more believably without adding Woody 's stutters and hand-ticks . Woody is the best at being Woody . When someone else tries , they 're not playing a character , they are modeling a recognizable actor . This type of thing only pulls the audience out of the story . My favorite Woody Allen movies make me leave the theater a little bit lighter in spirit than I walked in . This one made me wish I could get my money back .  
1	  Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best high-spirited comedies I have ever seen . It is misunderstood since it lacks the " social commentary " values that many films of the day ( 1969 ) required to be successful . The characters are over-the-top satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors . Christopher Plummer shines especially bright as Lord Foppington , a noble with hair too big to fit in the door . The plot involves the usual 18th century stuff ; mistaken identities , thwarted romances , corrupt government officials , and jokes at every turn . It answers the questions : What happens when 4 rambunctious , eager to party sailors are on leave in a small British coastal town ? And , who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out ? Despite doing poorly at the box office , it has great costumes , excellent music ( based on the Mermaid Theatre musical of the same name ) , great , lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic . That it has never been released on either VHS or DVD is truly a shame , since so many bad movies are released every day .  
0	  Despite its interesting premise , ' Sniper ' is quite tedious . With a tighter script and sharper directing it could have been electrifying ; instead it plods along with little tension .  
0	  I really wanted to like this film , but the story is ridicules . I don't want to spoil this film , - don't worry right from the begin you know something bad is going to happen - but here 's an example of how sloppy this film was put together . The Cowboy and " Twig " ride up the ridge . The Cowboy has a handle bar mustache . The Cowboy and " Twig " get into a shoot out and race half way down the ridge . The Cowboy is clean shaven through out the rest of the film . Sometime between the gun fight and the ride down the mountain the cowboy has had time to shave , in dark , on the back of a horse . To be fair , the acting by the four main characters is solid .  
0	  Scary Movie 3 is such a stinkfest its hard to put it in words . It makes movies like Malibu 's Most Wanted look like Oscar material , lets just say that . The original Scary Movie was great fun , one of the better 90s spoof movies , coming from a great team who previously rocked our world with Dont Be A Menace to South Central Whilst Drinking Your Juice in the Hood . But what the hell happened ? ! After the tragedy that was Scary Movie 2 , i thought the cast and crew change would help matters , but its even worse . Within 20mins i 'd smiled twice . Not one laugh , the jokes were recycled and originality was obviously no factor . The fact that at this point in writing , the majority of people on this site have voted it 10/10 has made me feel physically ill . When there 's great flicks like School of Rock out , which actually have jokes that are * gasp * funny , anyone wasting their money on tripe like this needs their head examined . no stars / *  
0	  It 's not a terrible movie , really , and Glenn and Keitel are top-notch actors . Further , they do an acceptable job with the very weak script . The scenery is lush and the plot has some interesting twists . Further , I umderstand why these actors and the crew made the film , they are professionals and they get paid for it . But I do wonder why studios spend the time and money to make a film and then don't release it for theater audiences ? Even if a film is a box-office flop , surely it makes some money . If you are a fan of Keitel or Glenn , rent the video or catch it on TV , as did I. Granted , the movie won't help solve the immigration quandary with Mexico , but the experience is far better than 90 % of the standard TV fare of today .  
1	  The movie within the movie - a concept done many times in the history of cinema . It is accomplished here as well as in any . If you love Carmen , you 'll love this version . If you love flamenco , you 'll love this version . The plot of the classic opera is played out in the actual rehearsal of the opera by a flamenco troupe . The music is authentic . The direction wonderful . If you like dancing , you 'll love this version . There is tragedy . There is passion . There is intrigue . There is .. Carmen .  
0	  In a nutshell : this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really WANTS and TRIES to be something more . It wants to be Harold and Maude , Annie Hall , The Graduate . It wants to be deep and human . It has interesting camera shots , lighting , music , editing , all of which give it the feel of an important movie . The dialog is smart - at times . There are some " laugh out loud " moments . But here 's what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic late-night-cable , in-flight , time-killer : 1 . David Schwimmer - how many times can Joe sad-sack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying ? Maybe some drool would have helped . 2 . Gwenneth Paltrow - she 's really flat here and not just in the chest . Her role is supposed to be this lively , nice , caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations , is very confused as a result , and that is why a sad-sack loser like Schwimmer has any chance with her . But Gwenneth plays her very dull . Combine this with puppy-dog drool-face ( above ) and you have very little chemistry to care about . ( I kept picturing someone else in this role - Kate Hudson for example . ) 3 . The script and the plot - the stuff that happens just basically doesn't ring true ; all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said " oops , time to wrap it up , got a train to catch ! " So they pulled out the Hollywood formula book , checked off all the boxes , and went home .  
0	  After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep , I decided that I may as well be entertained while I suffered from sleep deprivation . This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it . What a mistake ! Here is the plot ( potential spoilers , if you even care ) : a neurotic man with an addiction to candy ( Josh Kornbluth ) works as a temp for some ridiculous company . Suddenly , he is offered the chance to " go perm , " which seems to be the favorite catch-phrase of this movie . But with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp , Josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesn't want to do it . He hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt . His inability to send several " very important " letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious , but is merely stupid . Josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together ( obviously a fantasy of Josh 's in real life , as such a thing would never happen ) . A bunch of other stuff happens , but it 's too trite and inane to go into now . Despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy , I only laughed twice during it ; the first time was the opening shot of Josh Kornbluth ( my initial reaction was one of stifling fear ) and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman ( yeah , right ) . Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying-looking person I have ever seen in my life . He is an unattractive , overweight , balding Jewish man who I am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women . I do not at all sympathize with Josh 's character . He is lazy and unmotivated and I just don't appreciate the failed attempts at humor . Skip it , even if your life depends upon it .  
0	  When I bought this DVD I though : " It seems to be a nice light comedy about love and relationships made up in Portuguese standards let 's give it a chance " I was TOTALLY WRONG ! What a disappointing movie ! First , it 's not a comedy ; it 's a cheap drama which can be so melodramatic that it 's even worse than many Portuguese soap operas ! Second , the plot is so boring , and leads nowhere It has no structure , it just flows , like the wind , in one or another direction The production is also bad ! The sound mixing is horrible , because sometimes the voices are disconnected . It made me remind some old Portuguese movies from the 80's The acting should have been better too Well , to sum up , it 's not with films like this one that Portuguese cinema will improve ! In fact , it was one of the worst Portuguese movies I have seen in the last years ! Bad argument , bad acting , bad production I had no high hopes for this movie , but it was much worse than I 've ever imagined ! Just forget about it !  
0	  I rented this movie last week . I saw Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman were on it , so it seemed promising . And it was , until Justin Timberlake came on scene . He is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again . I mean , he is one of the most boring , uninspired actors I 've ever seen . He puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever . Why the hell was he cast for the role of Josh Pollack ? I think Matt Damon would have been a better choice . Kevin Spacey was another big disappointment . His character is so dull , it seems like a bad mix of his character in American Beauty and John Doe in Se7en . It might sound cool , but believe me , it 's not . Now , Dylan McDermott 's acting is very good . It 's about one of the very few good things about this movie . He is just inspired . Morgan Freeman is good but nothing special . He has some really cool lines though . About the story , although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good . I was expecting a big twist when Lazerov ( Dylan McDermott ) was killed , but nothing really happened .  
0	  After a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside , you 're pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy . Then the movie takes a turn for the worse . The warm feeling might still be there , but as others has said : The plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it 's almost unbearable to watch . The movie gets sped up , and you get the impression that you 're either fast forwarding through it , or that the producers decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and had to cut a lot of scenes out . Realism isn't a goal onto itself , but as a viewer , I 'm pretty convinced that this comedy isn't intentionally unrealistic , it just happens to be . On the plus side , this movie has a couple of nice interiors , and despite the bad script , I think that the actors performances are mainly good . If I could rate the first 25 minutes only , I 'd probably give it an eight . As it is now , it gets a four . .. And that 's being nice ! If you 're a sucker for romantic comedies you 'll probably have a great time anyways . If not , I 'd recommend that you watch something else .  
1	  Director / writer Michael Winner 's feature is a better than expected offbeat supernatural horror film ( although still schlock efficiently catered for ) , which really does by go unnoticed . Sure it might borrow ideas from other similar themed horror movies of this period , but still manages to bring its own psychological imprint to the smokescreen material ( of good vs . evil ) and a unique vision that has a fair share of impressively expansive , if somewhat exploitative set-pieces . As a whole it 's sketchy , however remains intriguing by instilling an ominous charge without going gang-busters with the scares . Actually there 's always something going on amongst its busy framework , but it 's rather down-played with its shocks steering to soapy patterns and atmospheric tailoring , up until its vividly repellent and grisly climax with a downbeat revelation . Winner 's dressed up craftsmanship might feel pedestrian , however it 's the ensemble cast that really holds it together as you try to spot the faces . There 's plenty too . Some having more to do with the scheme of things than others , but there 's no doubts every one of them are committed , despite the ludicrously crude nature of it all . It 's interesting to see names like Sylvia Miles ( who 's significantly creepy ! ) , Beverly D'Angelo ( likewise ) , Deborah Raffin , Eli Wallach , Christopher Walken , William Hickey ( a neat cameo ) , Jeff Goldblum , Jerry Orbach and Tom Berenger in bit parts . Then you got a mild-mannered Chris Sarandon and movingly gorgeous Cristina Raines in the leads . Offering able support José Ferrer , Martin Balsam , Ava Gardner , John Carradine , Burgess Meredith and Arthur Kennedy . The script does throw around many characters , as well as notions but gets disjointedly sidetrack by trying to squeeze all of it in . However it 's disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what 's really going on here . Is there a reason for all of this , and why is it surrounding Raines ' character ? The emphasis is mainly built upon that moody angle , as it begins to slowly shed light of her inner goings and that of the strange / worrying experiences she encounters when she 's moves into her new apartment . This is where Winner tries to pull out the eerie shades , which projects some icy moments . Gil Melle was the man responsible for the grand , overpowering orchestral score that never misses a cue and Richard C. Kratina instruments the sweeping , scope-like photography .  
0	  I had high hopes for this film , since it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance . But those hopes came crashing to earth in the first 20 minutes or so . Palance was ridiculous . Not even Heston 's acting or Annabel Schofield 's beauty ( or brief nude scenes ) could save this film . Some of the space effects were quite good , but others were cheesy . The plot was ludicrous . Even sci-fi fans should skip this one . Grade F  
1	  THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT , like I 'M ALL RIGHT JACK , takes a dim view of both labor and capital . Alec Guinness is a scientific genius - but an eccentric one ( he has never gotten his university degree due to an .. err .. accident in a college laboratory ) . He manages to push himself into various industrial labs in the textile industry . When the film begins he is in Michael Gough 's company , and Gough ( in a memorable moment ) is trying to impress his would-be father-in-law ( Cecil Parker ) by showing him the ship-shape firm he runs . While having lunch with Parker and Parker 's daughter ( Joan Greenwood ) , Gough gets a message regarding some problems about the lab 's unexpectedly large budget problems . He reads the huge expenditures ( due to Guinness 's experiments ) , and chokes on his coffee . Guinness goes on to work at Parker 's firm , and repeats the same tricks he did with Gough - but Parker discovers it too . Greenwood has discovered what Guinness is working on , and convinces Parker to continue the experiments ( but now legally ) . The result : Guinness and his assistant has apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly change the electronic bonds within it 's molecular structure so that ( for all intents and purposes ) the fiber will remain in tact for good . Any textile made from it will never fade , get dirty , or wear out - it will last forever . Guinness has support from a female shop steward , but not her chief . He sees Guinness as selling out to the rich . But when he explains to them what he 's done , they turn against him . If everyone has clothes that will last forever then they will not need new clothes ! Soon Parkers ' fellow textile tycoons ( led by Gough , Ernest Theisinger - in a wonderful performance , and Howard Marion-Crawford ) are equally panic stricken by what may end their businesses . They seek to suppress the invention . With only Greenwood in his corner ( although Parker sort of sympathizes with him ) , Guinness tries to get the news of his discovery to the public . In the end , Guinness is defeated by science as well as greed . But he ends the film seeing the error in his calculations , and we guess that one day he may still pull off his discovery after all . It 's a brilliant comedy . But is the argument for suppression valid ? At one point the difficulties of making the textile are shown ( you have to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually enable the ends of the material to be united . There is nothing that shows the cloth will stretch if the owner gets fat ( or contract if the owner gets thin ) . Are we to believe that people only would want one set of clothing for ever ? What happened to fashion changes and new styles ? And the cloth is only made in the color white ( making Guinness look like a white knight ) . We are told that color dye would have to be added earlier in the process . Wouldn't that have an effect on the chemical reactions that maintain the structure of the textile ? Alas this is not a science paper , but a film about the hypocrisies of labor and capital in modern industry . As such it is brilliant . But those questions I mention keep bothering me about the validity of suppressing Guinness ' invention  
0	  When I heard the plot for this movie I simply had to see it , I mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes ! Sadly the title is about as funny as it gets . Led by Detective Dick Mason , a special team of military and scientists ( including Greg Colburn who never takes his SCUBA outfit off and Lt . Finletter who is never pictured without his parachute trailing behind ) ' Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes ' is a parody of B-Movies , in particular Japanese horror of the 1950 's . The film begins with a standard sized tomato being discovered by a women washing up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the tomato has supposedly murdered this lady , and let me tell you it doesn't get any saner as the film progresses ! To be fair there are a couple of funny moments , for instance anytime the Japanese scientist Dr Nokitofa speaks his voice is dubbed over in an American accent , or when disguise expert Sam Smith infiltrates the tomatoes ' hey , can somebody please pass the ketchup ? ' . Equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept . Unfortunately for ' Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes ' spoof films such as the ' Airplane ' and ' Naked Gun ' series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since . The acting is atrocious ; there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy . For a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once , one gag after the over . The singing in the film seems pointless and the adverts for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre , even for this film . Ultimately , however , you can see why this film is a cult one ; I can't see many people being indifferent to it . Unfortunately terrible would be the way I would sum this up .  
1	  If your a hard core Freddy fan then you might not like it . This seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series . Not much to see here . The only reason it holds it self up is the back story on Freddy . The one thing that is always great in Nightmare movies are the death scenes . But the death scenes were very crappy in this . The visual effects were great and the acting was OK but the back story was excellent . Basically Freddy 's story comes full circle in this . I have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws : 1 . A Nightmare on Elm Street . ( 8/10 ) 2 . Freddy 's Dead : The Final Nightmare . ( 7/10 ) 3 . A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 : The Dream Master . ( 7/10 ) 4 . A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 : The Dream Warriors . ( 7/10 ) 5 . A Nightmare on Elm Street 5 : The Dream Child . ( 6/10 ) 6 . A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 : Freddy 's Revenge . ( 3/10 ) I recommend it if you enjoy the series . This is were Freddy is fully explained but thats all there is . Next on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare . ( 7/10 )  
1	  No , not really , but this is a very good film indeed , and is sadly a forgotten gem . Black and white suits the film . Straight forward formula , a guy had the plague and the authorities have to track down everyone he came in contact with before they die . Very well directed , and the acting is great . Richard Widmark as the male lead is good but is completely over shadowed in the acting stakes by Paul Douglas as the police captain , and Jack Palance ( never better than this ) and Zero Mostel as the baddies . Sadly Palance went on to play similar characters in some really second rate gangster or war movies .  
1	  The surprise nominee of this year 's Best Animated Feature race at the Oscars . It 's an Irish film by heart , but it was co-produced by Belgium and Brazil , with , I 'm guessing , animators working in all three countries . The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory . The character design is a little reminiscent of the French animated film Persepolis from a couple of years back , with very simple characters with thick , black outlines . This film is not in black and white . Oh no . What makes this film great is its use of color , simply some of the most outrageous and startling use of colors I 've ever seen . The general design of the pictures is also a lot more geometrical , with characters who are basically rectangles or ovals . Much of the film can be spent playing find the circle - a major aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image . All of these geometrical designs have a purpose - the story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts ( the Book of Kells is a real illuminated Bible ; the art of the film is based on the drawings in it ) . The story of the film isn't especially deep , but it 's a pretty good fantasy tale . Brendan is a young boy in Kells , a city surrounded by enormous walls , built by his uncle to keep out Vikings . A newcomer to Kells , Brother Aiden , inspires Brendan to take up illustrating . He also inspires him to do things like leave Kells and explore the nearby forest , within which lives a nymph . Bruno Coulais provides a fantastic score , almost as good as the one he did for Coraline , which I consider the very best of the year .  
1	  " Foxes " is one movie I remember for it 's portrayal of teenagers in the late 1970 's . As I am exactly Jodie Foster 's age , I related to this movie . It deals with the frustrations , temptations , relationships & rebellion of youth . The soundtrack is great with inspiring rock eg . " More Than a Feeling " by Boston and sad numbers like " On the Radio " by Donna Summer . The music of my late teens . Yep , I 'll always remember this one , even if it wasn't huge .  
0	  I 'm a Christian who generally believes in the theology taught in Left Behind . That being said , I think Left Behind is one of the worst films I 've seen in some time . To have a good movie , you need to have a well-written screenplay . Left Behind fell woefully short on this . For one thing , it radically deviates from the book . Sometimes this is done to condense a 400-page novel down to a two-hour film , but in this film I saw changes that made no sense whatsoever . Another thing , there is zero character development . When characters in the story get saved ( I won't say who ) , the book makes it clear that it 's a long , soul-searching process . In the film it 's quick and artificial . The book is written decently enough where people like Rayford Steele , Buck Williams and Hattie Durham seem real , but in the movie scenarios are consistently given the quick treatment without anything substantial . In another scene where one character gets angry about being left behind ( again , I won't say who ) , it seems artificial . I realize as a Christian it 's unedifying for me to say I disliked this film , but I can't in a good conscience recommend a film that I feel was horribly done . Perhaps it would 've been better to make the first book into 2-3 films . Either way , Christians need to realize that to be taken seriously as filmmakers , we need to start by putting together a film in a quality way . I realize a lot of effort probably went into Left Behind , but that 's the way I see it .  
1	  There 's no romance or other side plot to this movie , it 's action and intrigue all the way , making it a real man 's kung-fu movie . An aging master dispatches his last disciple Yan Tieh to stop his five former pupils who 's styles represents five venomous animals centipede , snake , scorpion , lizard and the toad . Despite the word " Venom " in the title , none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents . Yan Tieh told by his teacher that he 's no match for the five former pupil , must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four . How Yan Tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story , with good kung-fu action spread out throughout the story . Recognized as a cult classic , this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung - fu action movies . It 's known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story . It 's no artistic masterpiece , with the usual bad dubbing , and corny acting , but the movie is one of the best of its kind , because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung-fu action movie of its time , and gives an extra concentrated dose of them . One movie you must watch if you are a kung-fu movie fan .  
0	  A repressed housewife ( an annoying lisping Angie Dickinson , whose body double treats / horrifies us with an extreme closeup of her delicates ) is sexually bored by her husband and decides to branch-out . This directly results in a string of murders that soon involve a high-class prostitute ( Nancy Allen , clearly I am in the wrong business if SHE can bring home $ 600 a night ) and her psychologist ( Michael Caine ) . If you are going to watch De Palma rip off ( excuse me , " pay homage to " ) Hitchcock , watch " Sisters " instead of this . " Dressed to Kill , " while loaded with style and technical skill , is one of the tackiest thrillers I have had the displeasure of sitting through . The plot is absurd and tired . It does feature some surprisingly effective jump scares and nasty graphic murder sequences that should please any horror fan , as long as they can get past the silly story line , that must have been dated even in 1980 .  
0	  OK now , lets see . What was funny in the first movie ? I know , people with funny accents , people falling into the water , silly boat crashes and funny comments between the two teams . In this movie they have twisted the accent part to the max , no good . A whole a lot of people are falling into the water for uncertain reasons , no good . Boatcrash , check . Funny comments between the two teams , they tried but failed . Also , there are too may personalities they are following in this movie . This film should be about what is happening on the water , not on land . I am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max . No good . All in all , I give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts .  
0	  Cut tries to be like most post-Scream slashers tried to be , a spoof of the horror genre that tried to be clever by referencing other famous horror movies . Now , I am not bagging ' Scream , ' as I think ' Scream ' is a very good horror movie that does a great job of blending horror and comedy . Cut fails on most levels . It has its moments but overall it just does not work out , not even as a " so bad it 's good " movie , just a below average one . The first five minutes or so are OK and set the story fairly well , apart from the fact that Kylie Minogue can't really act , and ironically she gets her tongue out , go figure . Go forward some time and a group of film students want to finish her film off , which is apparently cursed . And , as you have probably predicted , one by one the cast and crew are slowly picked off by a masked madman . Unoriginal plot , poor acting and a predictable ending are a few of the elements that follow . There is plenty of referencing in the film , everything from ' Scream ' to ' The Texas Chain Saw Massacre . ' This isn't smart either , it feels as though the director wanted to feel smart and cool by mentioning other famous horror flicks ala Scream . For a slasher there is minimal gore and no nudity , which is a huge negative when it comes to a slasher that has not got a whole lot going for it . Really , I should be supporting this movie because I 'm Australian and we 're not as good when it comes to horror ( we do have our gems , though ) but Cut is definitely not one of them . However , it did keep me watching for the 90 minutes or so , so that is something good at least . I would not recommend this to anyone apart from hardcore slasher fans , who may be able to appreciate what this film is trying to aim for , but if you are looking for a good movie , stay away . 2/5  
0	  Take your basic Frankenstein flick , inject some Reanimator ( but not the good parts ) , and you have Doctor Hackenstein . Certainly , this was obviously inspired by aforementioned films but it never materializes as anything special on its own . A scientist accidentally kills his wife , so the whole movie takes place over the course of one night as he attempts to revive his wife . To revive his wife , he decides to chop off body parts from some women that have become stranded and , coincidentally , decide to stay the night at his place . I can't really say the acting is bad , nor is the directing . Everything here is just way too standard . What little attempts there are at humor actually work ( check out the scene when Hackenstein keeps hiding behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw him clutching a woman and a needle ) , but that 's hardly enough to recommend this film . The music is decent , what blood that 's there is decent , and the cast looks quite good . And for half of the time , I was even entertained by this film . But I never felt like this was anything more than a time waster . Avoidable . Try Frankenhooker instead .  
1	  I first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on DVD . James Stewart brings great depth to the role of Chip Hardesty , a hardworking and dedicated FBI agent . His life in the Bureau is intercut with his family life , which is not all rosy . His wife ( an excellent portrayal by Vera Miles ) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job , and they even separate for a time ; Chip 's best friend and fellow agent Sam Crandall ( Murray Hamilton ) is killed in a gunfight ; Chip 's son , Mike , enlists in the Marines during World War II . Through it all , the family carries on with bravery and dignity . The action sequences are quite exciting and the semi-documentary style of the film works effectively . And the music by Max Steiner says it all ; fidelity , bravery and integrity . This country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the FBI and , yes , to J. Edgar Hoover as well . If Mr. Hoover 's type of vigilance had been observed , we might have been spared 9/11 , the surge in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we 've had to put up with since his passing .  
1	  I am a massive fan of Jet Li ! He is THE best HK action film star alive .. and consequently - This film rocked ! I saw it in the video store and , as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store , I didnt register its presence at first , and had to look twice . I immediately knew what I would be renting out . My only qualm ( I suppose I expected it ) is that it was dubbed ( AARGh ) and not subtitled . Elsewise , the movie 's original / strange / cool plot , and full on action made it one of Jet Li 's better movies .. even though they all fall under that category ..  
1	  There are two movie experiences I will always cherish . The first was seeing " Star Wars " for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother . A close second is sneaking into Halloween at the Tripple Plex with my good friend , Trevor , in late October 1978 . Halloween left me breathless , speechless , and downright scared . Everyone knows the story . Young Michael Myers decides to kill his sister on Halloween 1963 . He escapes a mental hospital 15 years later to return to Haddofield to wreck havoc once again . He spots Laurie ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) , a shy senior who enjoys babysitting , and begins stalking her . Her partying friends across the street are killed , one-by-one as Michael sets his plot to get her . Ironically , the young boy she tends on Halloween is afraid of the " Boogeman , " and can see him outside . During the murder spree , Dr. Sam Loomis ( Donald Pleasance ) works hard to find Michael before he unleashes his fury . He has no proof , no evidence , just a hunch he has to sell to Sheriff Bracket ( Charles Cyphers ) . As the plot unfolds , you have a suspense-driven movie instead of a cheap thrill scare . Alfred Hitchcock once said , " You can have four men at a table playing cards and they don't know there is a bomb and it goes off . That is a cheap thrill . However , put four men at a table who discover a bomb and discuss what to do about it-then it doesn't go off , then you have suspense . " Director John Carpenter takes that advice to the hilt in Halloween . The audience will see glimpses of him outside , watching , stalking his victims . We gasp . Will he kill her ? When will he kill her ? Then , Michael disappears . Carpenter also uses the suspense in lieu of special effects that usually highlight the gore . This movie has little blood , but still provides good scares . One of the best scenes is Michael lifting Bob off the ground . He rears the knife back as it glints off the moonlight , then he drives it . All you hear is a loud thud , then the audience sees Bob 's feet drop lifelessly . Carpenter was the first to use a vantage point from the scene of the killer . This also peaks our audience . What will he do ? What 's going on inside his mind ? Finally , Carpenter 's hauntingly masterful score adds to the tension . Moreover , the tandem screen writing he did with Debra Hill gives us a story which develops characters we care about . The teens are not " party mad , " but merely going through the rebellious angst of teenage wasteland . Finally , there is some decent acting in this " B , " low-budget thriller . Nick Castle who plays " the Shape " ( Michael ) adds something to the mindless killer . It is cold , merciless , and without any pathology . Moreover , the personality does everything the same way . He kills only when trapped , or to set up a trap . He splits the victims apart . He also relies on brute strength . And that mask used ( a bleached William Shatner mask ) gives an impression of something that has no soul or emotion . While Pleasance is melodramatic in his deadpan monologues , he comes across as someone scared , desperate , and determined . It made me wonder if he represented modernism 's fading attempt to explain evil . The crown jewel , though , is Jamie Lee Curtis ' debut . She plays the Laurie character as someone scared , but also determined and strong who fights back . The end is one that left me speechless . This was the first concept of an indestructible serial killer who could not be stopped . Movies like Star Wars have the advantage that it can be enjoyed numerous times . Halloween , and other scary movies , though , do not have that advantage . So if we could erase our minds of the first time we see a movie to experience it again as fresh and new , Halloween would be the movie I would choose .  
1	  This episode of Twilight Zone combines a silent section ( 1890 ) with melodramatic acting and sight gags , an homage to the early Buster Keaton films . Lots of slapstick : Buster falling on a bulkhead door , falling in a puddle , running around pants-less . Silly scientist 's invention of a Time Helmet , reminiscent of a Flash Gordon idea of what the future would be . Cheap prices , like $ 1.95 for ladies hats , or 17 cents a pound for beef seem outrageously high to Buster . Even the world of 1890 is too much for Buster / Mulligan . How shocking when he is mistakenly transported to the " modern " world of 1960 ! Buster was trying to go backwards ! The " scientist " of that time wants to return to a calmer world , the 1890 that he has studied and admired . They go back together , and Buster / Mulligan is now happy and the " scientist " regrets not having electronic equipment , modern beds or an electric blanket . So Buster sends him back with the crazy helmet . This Twilight Zone doesn't have a heavy message . Since Buster Keaton died in 1966 , it is one of his last efforts . That 's enough . One other cute thing-longtime underutilized Maytag Man Jesse White is a repairman who fixes the Time Helmet-foreshadowing his washing machine career .  
1	  This film , as low budget as it may be , is one of the best psychological thrillers I 've ever seen . If you accept that it 's low budget from the start , you can appreciate just how good of a story it is , how very well written the script is , and how great the filmmaker was to produce something so wonderful with so little money . All the elements of a great film are here . The visuals , though shot on digital , were gorgeous in places . The bizarre , dreamy feel of the film is captured particularly well in the scene with the talking dog , that scene was just amazing . It 's such a trippy piece of work , but not done in a pretentious way , and because of that I have a whole lot of respect for this film . It comes highly recommended to anyone looking for something unique and captivating , and different from much of the repetitive films that are out there .  
0	  It Could Have Been A Marvelous Story Based On The Ancient Races Of Cat People , but it wasn't . This work could have been just that ; marvelous and replete with mythological references which kept my fascination fueled . The lead characters ( Charles Brady played by Brian Krause ; and his mother Mary , played by Alice Krige ) were shallowly done , had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing . Not even Mädchen Amick ( who played Tanya Robertson ) ' s character fit into that description . However , as I 've said many times before , when you adapt a Stephen King novel for TV , you simply must take into account the fact that his books aren't written for TV , and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist . This is another botched attempt to take the magick of Stephen King writing , whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay . To simply cut and paste his work onto the small screen . His novels get completely bastardized in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie ; nothing less but certainly nothing more . His screenplays are hit and miss . Unfortunately , this screenplay translation was a miss . Sorry , Sorry , Sorry movie . This movie gets a 1.0/10 from .. the Fiend : .  
0	  The US appear to run the UK police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that CID officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub ! This has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of " real " UK police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public . I can see that Mr Snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like Charles Dance was doing in it is a mystery . Worse than the worse low budget " B " film of the 50 's . An hour and a half of suicide and time I will never get back . Avoid it like the veritable plague .  
1	  I loved it , having been a fan of the original series , I have always wondered what the back story would be - it didn't fail to delight me . I also love the fact that apart from Eric Stoltz I didn't recognise one person - this is refreshing , much like BSG . It has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent - can't wait for the series to start airing . Well done to Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent job . The special effects , dialogue and acting were all spot on , and I felt emotionally tied up in the storyline . I know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment , but I felt that Caprica was far superior to most of the Sci-Fi stuff produced in the last decade .  
1	  When it came out , this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment . To this day it 's more entertaining than most , in great part because it has James Cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty " girl Friday " played by Joan Blondell . Also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by Busby Berkeley are pretty much a knock-out as far as that type of thing goes . But this is a pretty strange movie . I mean in one of those numbers , you 've got Billy Barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler , doing all kinds of weird stuff . Ruby Keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times , but at least she 's not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films . You 'd never guess that Dick Powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie ; apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star Cagney . As for Cagney , his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time . After a while it gets a bit too much . You expect him to walk out and say , " Hey ! I 've got a great idea for a prologue ! The women are cigarettes , and they come out of a pack of smokes ! Oh no , we did that one last month ! " It 's funny but it gets a bit repetitive . In the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl , Ruth Donnelly , some of the established Cagney gangster character comes out . In fact frequent B gangster director William Keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching , and it seems at times that Cagney and Blondell are invoking something very " street " even though the characters aren't criminal . The musical numbers .. what can you say ? They stand alone as entertainment , the way that Berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling . But none of them really mean anything . It means " Honeymoon Hotel " , nothing really more or less . And the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately , since the characters in the show are doing things that couldn't possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays . For example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper , things like that . The whole thing could only exist on film , so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous . I can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so , because this is a very polished production . It 's great to see Cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills , and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like Keeler . Cagney and Blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well . The music I would say is only mediocre , but mostly pleasing if repetitive . Bacon 's direction in general is very suitable but never interesting . The film 's entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way . It 's a cut above most " let 's put on a show " films of the 30s .  
0	  Based on the personal experiences of director John Singleton 's time at the University of Southern California , comes Higher Learning . A film centered on the racial politics that occur at modern day colleges . There are three main characters to which the film bases its foundation around for its story : Malik Williams , an carefree lowbrow athlete who is an African American male . Kristin Conner , a sheltered soft white girl , and Remy , a unsophisticated unconnected white male . All three are overcome by the sudden realities that college life is not as good as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment by being unprepared ( Malik ) , by being naive ( Kristin ) , and by being unwanted ( Remy ) . One good thing about the film is that it does show that modern American colleges are just high schools writ large . The colleges are not places to build character , develop potential , or enhance personal advancement , but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a one size fits all atmosphere . It is an experience that usually is built for failure for most students . It would have been good if the film built it story about this travesty rather than racial politics . But it didn't and that 's where the films falls apart . Singleton , it seems , had a pretty bad experience at Southern California . Through this film he lets it all hang out . There is no need to beat around the bush here . Singleton lets the heroes and the villains of this piece be easily seen . The black characters in the film are pretty much seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains , save for Kristin , who was raped by a fellow white student . Who can understand the inconsistencies of this film ? Black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out to them who supposedly raped her ? The ease that the black gang members have at the university while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark small dorm planning violence ? The performances of Omar Epps ( Malik ) and Kristy Swanson ( Kristin ) are disappointing . They do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie ( Tupac Shakur and Drew Barrymore were supposed to play Malik and Kristin but were unavailable ) . O'Shea Jackson aka Ice Cube , Busta Rhymes , and Regina King were all irritating in their respective roles . And Laurence Fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor . Only Michael Rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character , of the three main characters , changed the most in the film . John Singleton wanted to take on the matter of race and inequality in American college life with this film . And he did so quite badly . It was sort like killing a fly with a shotgun . Life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this . Higher Learning is proof that he did not understand this at all . Seeing the film , then and now , would only confuse , disappoint and enrage the same public he would wish to speak to . Not to mention it would not entertain them in the slightest .  
1	  I really enjoyed this movie . It took a pretty dark story-that of Shakespeare 's Macbeth - and wrapped it in a quirky , often funny and poignant modern yarn . Kudos to the way the filmmaker brought the very different worlds of modern NYC and Macbeth 's Scotland together under one roof . The opposing worlds act to really bring out the intrigue and comedy of the play and you have to love Harold Perrineau as the Chorus , a part which doesn't exist in the play but really helps to jazz things up . The ending stands out among little indies I 've seen for it 's closure and originality .  
0	  It must be the most corniest TV show on the air . This is probably a escape for Jim Belushi and all of his bad movies . His brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother . I hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use . Jim has got to retire or something . Please let them go of the air . If i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush . Id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing . I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running . We all know deep down that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim 's face . In conclusion , no more please .  
1	  In my opinion , this is one of the greatest movies ever made in America and it deserved every single award it won and it 's place on the AFI Top 100 list ( though it 's shamefully too low on the IMDB Top 250 list , at only # 183 as of this writing ) . If you enjoy acting of the highest calibre ( Voight and Hoffman are a superb match ) , well-drawn characterizations and inventive direction , editing and cinematography , you 'll love this just as much as I did . Schlesinger paints a vivid , always credible picture of the late 60s New York City scene and it 's many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality , poverty and hopelessness of 42nd Street , New York City . The filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground New York film movement ( and of the city ) and are nothing less than dazzling . I 've seen many ideas ( including the rapid-fire editing , the handling of the voice-over flashbacks , the drug / trip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror ) stolen by other filmmakers . The relationship between Joe and Ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship OR having it 's homosexual underpinnings . I think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times , but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life , whether it be sexual or not . MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave , moving film of magnitude , influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of it 's impact over the years , so if you haven't seen it , you 're really missing out on a true American classic . I recommend this film to everyone . Score : 10 out of 10 .  
1	  This is a plain old spooky ghost story . I showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club , and they were kept spellbound until the ending ! No blood or gore - just good old fashioned suspense . It starts out right from the beginning , and builds and builds . The ending is a real twist that caught me unawares . Well directed and well acted . It is also a " period piece " - set in the 1920s - which added to the atmosphere . I was so impressed I got the book by Susan Hill from Amazon . The movie follows the book rather closely . It 's a shame it 's not readily available on DVD . My copy is VHS . This along with " Haunted " are probably two of the best Ghost Stories I 've ever scene . Which just goes to show that a little creativity outdoes " in your face " gore any day !  
1	  I remember the original series vividly mostly due to it 's unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter . Kolchak was hard-bitten newsman from the Ben Hecht school of big-city reporting , and his gritty determination and wise-ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode eminently watchable . My personal fave was " The Spanish Moss Murders " due to it 's totally original storyline . A poor , troubled Cajun youth from Louisiana bayou country , takes part in a sleep research experiment , for the purpose of dream analysis . Something goes inexplicably wrong , and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth . This malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state , and brutally suffocates them to death . Kolchak investigates and uncovers this horrible truth , much to the chagrin of police captain Joe " Mad Dog " Siska ( wonderfully essayed by a grumpy Keenan Wynn ) and the head sleep researcher played by Second City improv founder , Severn Darden , to droll , understated perfection . The wickedly funny , harrowing finale takes place in the Chicago sewer system , and is a series highlight . Kolchak never got any better . Timeless .  
1	  Eric Stoltz delivers an extraordinary performance as Joel Garcia , a successful young novelist who winds up paralyzed and in a special hospital for the recently disabled after breaking his neck in a hiking accident . While learning to cope and adjust with the gravity of his new limited physical condition Joel befriends slick , fast-talking , charming womanizer Raymond ( an amazing Wesley Snipes ) and boorish , surly , racist biker Bloss ( a terrific William Forsythe ) , who feels threatened by the diverse multi-ethnic array of fellow patients he 's forced to share a room with . Joel also receives substantial support from his loyal and loving , but married girlfriend Anna ( radiantly played by Helen Hunt ) . But he still must come to terms with being disabled on his own . This remarkable movie 's key triumph is its laudably stubborn refusal to neither sanitize nor sentimentalize the severity of what these men are going through . Directors Neil Jimenez ( who also wrote the thoughtful and insightful script ) and Micheal Steinberg relate the story with exceptional taste , wit and warmth , specifically addressing with disarming candor and matter-of-factness how being handicapped irrevocably alters one 's lifestyle , including and especially your sex life ( this point is most powerfully made in a striking sequence when Joel and Anna try and fail to make love in a motel room ) . Besides the expected poignancy , the film further provides a surprising surplus of wickedly funny raw , earthy humor that 's highlighted by the uproarious sequence with Joel and Bloss making a secret nocturnal expedition to a strip club . The uniformly superb acting qualifies as another significant plus : Stoltz , Snipes , Forsythe and Hunt are all outstanding , with stand-out supporting turns by Grace Zabriskie as Bloss ' doting , amiable mother and Elisabeth Pena and William Allen Young as compassionate hospital nurses . Despite the grim subject matter , the film ultimately proves to be a very moving , positive and uplifting cinematic testament to the astonishing strength and durability of the human spirit . A simply wonderful little gem of a drama .  
1	  Excellent P.O.W. adventure , adapted by Eric Williams from his own book ( a paperback copy of which forms part of my father 's library ) that was inspired by true events ; it may well be the first film of its kind and , therefore , has a lot to answer for  not just similarly stiff-upper-lipped examples such as ALBERT , R.N. ( 1953 ; which I 'll be watching presently ) , THE COLDITZ STORY ( 1955 ) and DANGER WITHIN ( 1959 ) but higher-profile releases from the other side of the Atlantic , namely STALAG 17 ( 1953 ) and THE GREAT ESCAPE ( 1963 ) . This , then , sets the basis pretty solidly : British soldiers interned in a German camp devise an ingenious plan of escape , borrowing a page from Greek legend  burrowing from under a vaulting horse used during physical exercise and in full view of their captors ! Actually , the film is neatly split into two halves : the first deals with the slow process of digging the tunnel , culminating in the escape itself , while the latter stages depict their fortunes outside the camp as they try to make it to neutral Sweden . Typically of these British films , the cast showcases several established ( Leo Genn ) , current ( Anthony Steel ) and up-and-coming ( Peter Finch , David Tomlinson and Bill Travers ) stars , to say nothing of innumerable reliable character actors ( Anthony Dawson , Bryan Forbes , Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell ) . The three leads / escapees are Genn , Steel and Tomlinson : while the first two stick together , the latter goes his own way  only to run into the others on reaching safety . As can be expected , the narrative involves plenty of suspense and excitement ; as with most male-centered P.O.W. sagas , too , female interest is kept to the barest minimum . Director Lee didn't have a lengthy career  with this and the somewhat similar ( albeit with a change of both setting and viewpoint ) A TOWN LIKE ALICE ( 1956 ) his most noteworthy achievements  but he certainly milked every gripping situation in this case ( even if , reportedly , delays in filming saw Lee quitting his post prematurelyleaving producer Ian Dalrymple with the task of tying up loose ends ! ) . Anyway , worth special mention is the exquisite lighting ( particularly during night-time sequences ) throughout .  
0	  Ouch , what a painfully BORING Sci-Fi movie ! And that 's especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so action-packed and full of potential ! During the intro , we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of top-secret files . As he 's about to reveal the supposedly horrible & inhuman events that take place in the lab , he 's executed . Figures From then on , the ' action ' swifts back and forth between two locations , the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator ( or something ) , and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing . More like dull , pointless and vague . Scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it 's really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds , anyway . They all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed ; yet I fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanity-threatening device . Perhaps I missed something , but I doubt it . The interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow , as really none of them have personalities . So basically , " The Brain Machine " just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room . The film also could have been half an hour shorter if it weren't for a THOUSAND stagnant shots of buildings ! The relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated EVERY SINGLE TIME by a five-second shot of the places . Either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all Sci-Fi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves . Staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying , I assure you . James Best 's performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent , but one man definitely can't save this thing from being an absolute waste of time . Avoid !  
0	  I guess this would be a great movie for a true believer in organized Christian Dogma , but for anyone with an open mind who believes in free will , rational thinking , the separation of Church & State and GOOD Science Fiction it is a terrible joke ! There are some well known actors who were either badly in need of work or had a need to share their personal beliefs with the rest of us heathens . I WAS entertained by this movie in the same way I was entertained by " Reefer Madness . " That movie attempted to teach drug education by scare tactics the same way this movie tries to teach " Christian " principles with the threat of hell and misery for otherwise good people who don't share their interpretations of our world . It had me howling with laughter and at the same time scared me to realize how many people actually believe that our society should revert to the good old days of the 19th century !

0	  There is a lot of talk of torture these days . That 's all this movie is . It 's about a good person who makes a bad decision . Because of his kindness , he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women . From then on its a just-for-kicks assault on him . I don't know at what point you do something about it . There is a wife and child out there somewhere ; he has great feelings of guilt and fear . But there should have been some times when he could have acted . The movie seems to be somebody 's joke . I suppose in the wake of the Manson murders , we had a bit of a fixation on the likes of these two . Nevertheless , why would someone make a film like this ? What appeals does it have except for sadism . The conclusion is totally unsatisfying , but that could have been remedied with an obvious plot twist . Oh , well . Another hour and a half of my life .  
0	  First let me state that I do not believe in god ( if you want to use the word atheist , fine , but I don't like that word since it describes what I 'm not , not what I am ) but I hated this " documentary . " The production values were damn near non existent , the premise extremely shaky and whole thing seemed to be an exercise in Brian Flemming 's insecurities . The production values were terrible and Brian Flemming is clearly an amateurish director at best . The narration sounded like he just narrated over the film all in one shot , and he didn't practice at all . There were way to many umms and pauses when he should have been talking in the movie . animation was also pretty damn bad . The whole idea that Jesus is a mythical character is not taken seriously by historians and biblical scholars . As I stated before , I do not believe in God , and I don't think that whether or not Jesus was a real man says nothing about the existence of God . My personal view , Jesus probably was a real man but he lived in a time where there were many massiah 's ( look up apollonius of tiana ) and that the stories of his life and preaching were blown out of proportion the farther you got from his death . According to the Wikipedia article on the historicity of Jesus ( and there 's a good citation for this so it 's garbage ) " virtually all scholars in the fields of biblical studies and history agree that Jesus was a Jewish teacher from Galilee who was regarded as a healer , was baptized by John the Baptist , was accused of sedition against the Roman Empire , and on the orders of Roman Governor Pontius Pilate was sentenced to death by crucifixion . [ 1 ] " I was left wondering at the end of the documentary if this was more about the director 's insecurities than anything else . I was left wondering if he was trying to convince himself more than anyone else . The most telling example of this is the final interview he was with the religious school principal . He 's not even coy about it . The way he bombards the teacher is unfair and while I agree with the director partially , that teaching kids about hell fire is a bad thing , the way that Flemming confronted the principal was just awkward to watch . Flemming had a chance to perhaps get a good discussion going , if he was more tactile with his interview . Instead he comes off aggressive with " isn't it bad to teach kids this stuff . " The guy cuts the interview short and I mean , what did he expect , the principal to say " oh yes , I see it is , I have seen the light , this will now be a secular school ? " It seems that Flemming is getting revenge for what he feels was a wrong done to him in childhood . This isn't about the documentary , this is about Flemming 's insecurities , and has nothing to do with the supposed topic of the documentary . Flemming shows what he 's really doing here , and that is the real downfall of this so-called documentary .  
0	  Some people say Steve Irwin 's larrikin antics and gregarious personality are only an act . Watch this film : it 's obvious he can't act . Steve Irwin , dangerman star of the small screen in his * Crocodile Hunter Diaries * , * Croc Files * and eponymous * Crocodile Hunter * series ( you see a naming trend here , or is it just me ? ) , rockets his larger-than-strife persona to the big screen with * Crocodile Hunter : Collision Course * ( yup  there 's a definite trend of words beginning with ' C ' ) - basically an episode of * Crocodile Hunter * mashed together with a B-Movie . On a mission to relocate a big croc to save it from being shot by an eccentric farmer ( Magda Szubanski ) , Steve and wife Terri are unaware that the croc is being tracked by American spies ( Lachy Hulme and Kenneth Ransom ) , out to recover a spy satellite beacon it has swallowed . Will it hurt my credibility to say " They 're on a Collision Course with Wackiness " ? ( what credibility ? - Ed note . ) The plot is irrelevant , as it is Steve 's animal magnetism that propels the film . If you find his persona trying , the film is a failure , but if you 're a fan of either him ( as a businessman , conservationist or just plain ass-klown ) or his television shows , expect more of the same on a wide-screen budget . John Stainton , faithful liege , best mate and helmer of the Crocodile Hunter * oeuvre * ( can it be called that with a straight face ? ) , writes and directs with the same provincial swagger that made Steve a household wildlife jester . The most jarring aspect of this movie is that Steve ( one of the few people for whom you can actually hear the exclamation points going by as he speaks ) and Terri ( Steve 's spouse of 10 years , fiercest ally and closest friend ) treat it like it IS one of their documentaries , breaking the " fourth wall " and speaking directly to the camera , whilst all the other characters behave as if they 're in a bad movie ( well ) . It wouldn't be so incongruous if Steve and Terri were kept separated from the rest of the characters  but when the Bad Americans constantly threaten Steve 's life , we Confused Viewers must ask ourselves why the indifferent camera crew doesn't at least call the cops if not try to poke the bad guys in the eye with the boom mics , or run screaming into the bush  anything but continue filming casually with great lighting , crisp audio and seven action angles . While Terri is unfairly painted as Steve 's mildly incompetent sidekick ( her acting consists of boldly inept line reads and gadding about in pear shaped buttock hugging jeans - for the last , I 'm not complaining ) , Steve goes about his business-as-usual of show-and-tell with creatures intent on killing him , doing all his stunts himself because , well , to him they 're not really stunts , just a Day At The Office . Of course , watching this madman 's koo-koo adventures after his tragic death in September 2006 casts a strange detachment over the proceedings . But to those of us who never met him , this kind of malarkey ( as well as various incarnations of the * Crocodile Hunter * series in constant re-runs ) keeps him as alive as ever in our crocodile burrows . The wrenching reality of his absence will only be apparent to those nearest him . And I truly wish them the best in following in his outsize footprints So enjoy this diversion for what it is  a half-baked movie featuring a full-on legend . He died doing what he loved  interacting with wildlife - and he could never have asked for more of his first feature film in portraying him doing just that .

0	  Watching this movie made me think constantly ; why are they making such a problem out of some broken brakes ? There are a million options to slow down the car ! In the movie Speed the writers a least thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop .. There aren't many good things to say about this film ; all the usual narrative cliche 's make their appearance , the actors are very bad , the story is as leak as a sieve etc . That makes this movie a waste of time and money .  
0	  This movie is a prime example of squandering great resources in a film . You 've got future SNL and SCTV stars in their prime , such as John Candy , Chevy Chase , Laraine Newman , Al Franken , Tom Davis and Joe Flaherty essentially making 70 minutes of coarse , uninspired fart and racist jokes . The concept of a network from the future subverting society could have really been taken to some interesting extremes , but instead right out the gate , makes a lame , juvenile proctology joke and stays in that vein of humor the whole way . Seek out the earlier and much more subversive and witty Groove Tube or the later , hilarious Kentucky Fried Movie . This movie is only for those who want to see a time capsule of bad 70 's sketch comedy movies .  
0	  Just finished watching , can't say I was impressed . It starts of quite good , the visual and the atmosphere gives a creepy feeling as this type of movie should . But it all ends when the first lordi monster appears . Not only do you recognize them from the band lordi , but they are seriously malplaced in the movie . Doomsday monsters with leather jackets and piercings are so 80 's . As for the storyline , it starts of as similar horror movies , people trapped inside a hell hole . But there is no clear story on why and what is happening . The viewer is thrown some lines on possible reasons , but the lines never meet and end up to anything but a mess . With all the money spent on this film , with an intriguing start and some good effects , I had thought someone would have taken better care of the product . I wonder if lordi made this movie just to prove that their show costumes could be scary ( except they aren't ) . So the movie gets cred for the visuals , i guess the money had to go somewhere . But the rest is an embarrassing attempt from a rock band to make their on-stage monster aliases scarier .  
1	  Things to Come is that rarity of rarities , a film about ideas . Many films present a vision of the future , but few attempt to show us how that future came about . The first part of the film , when war comes to Everytown , is short but powerful . ( Ironically , film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking England-appeasement was at its height . Wells ' prediction was borne out all too soon . ) The montage of endless war that follows , while marred by sub-par model work , is most effective . The explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of German Expressionist graphic design . The art director was the great William Cameron Menzies , and his sets of the ruins of Everytown are among his best work . Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the Chief 's mistress . The Everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design . The acting in the 21st century story is not compelling-perhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970 . Unfortunately , the model work , representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways , is laughably bad and could have been done much better , even with 30s technology . This is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing . This is redeemed by Raymond Massey 's magnificent speech that concludes the film-rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well . Massey 's final question is more relevant now than ever , in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight . The scene is aided by the stirring music of Sir Arthur Bliss , whose last name I proudly share . Unfortunately , the VHS versions of this film are absolutely horrible , with serious technical problems . Most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038 . I hope a good DVD exists of the entire film .  
1	  I loves this movie , because it showed that they were not killing for fun but to save the ones they loved ! Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom did a great job portraying Ned and Joe . It has a few quick inappropriate scenes but is all right other than that . The language is very mild and sometimes don't even know it is there . This movie shows that just because they are outlaws does not mean that they are vicious killers ! I hope that people will watch this movie and learn about important times in history like this one . There is one thing that fascinates me about this movie is that they got their inspiration for their armor from a book Ned looked at ! Also that that is how people remember them , from their armor . I hope that people will watch this movie and get interested as I have .  
0	  Scary Movie 3 ( 2003 ) was a bad idea to begin with . The last film was a mediocre effort . Put it next to this load , it 's a comedy classic . Whilst part two was filled with a lot of dated humor and cheap shots , at least it was funny . There 's nothing funny about forced humor . Jokes , pratfalls and sight gags are supposed to be naturally funny . Hitting the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool . The humor in this film was caters to juvenile imbeciles who 'll laugh at anything . When they catered to the junior high school crowd , any sense of self respect was tossed out the window . Ring parodies are not funny . I have watched them in comedies since 1998 . They 're so dated . Michael Jackson jokes are not cool either . What 's even worse is making fun of two broken down has been " performers " whose best days were NEVER . The death of American cinema has been a slow one . Films like this are the nails that are being pounded into it 's coffin . Whatever happened to real humor ? I haven't laughed out loud in a movie theater in a long time . Too many bad movies rot the brain . You want proof ? Go to your local mega chain video rental store and see what 's on the shelves . This movie is bad . Don't believe the hype . I would rather watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop than to suffer through this poor excuse of a comedy ever again ! Definitely not recommended ( unless you have a handful of brain cells ) .  
1	  I saw this movie after i saw Blue Crush and other of Michelle 's movies , i thought she had a bleak future in this business . I was extremely wrong after watching her performance in " Girlfight " i was amazed in the way she captures the emotion of one a fighter , but also a warrior . In this movie the way she confronts her father about the treatment of her and her brother , the way she conveys anger when getting hit . Her characters learning curve in the movie of she cant always put up a wall and hide from love , or that just because she has power she wont win . I believe this role was fit perfectly for Michelle even though she had no prior experience , the director saw talent , I criticize myself for not seeing the talent in her .  
1	  The reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did ! That means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it . When I first saw this Movie it scared me and made me think about life and religion . This is not a blood and gore scary type movie , but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written . Of course non believers will say its only a sci-fi movie . Truth is , this movie is a must have for your thriller collection , even if it does have a religious view . If you are a fan of classic thrillers ( Omen .. etc ) this is one of them and its a must have . I never saw the sequel ( Distant Thunder ) , but I believe it picks up where this movie ends .  
0	  The movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level . By presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for Christ . Somehow , according to the plot , god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it 's self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds . Yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer . The lead character , an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman , ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer . In other threads of the underdeveloped plot Jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of God . The modern lackluster incarnation of Christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well . He is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it 's self . Meanwhile , with little help from Jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty . I also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels . This movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that I could clearly interpret except to mock people 's beliefs . It raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer . It disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment . Silly  
1	  I have seen the film a few days back on a video tape and even though it was hard to swallow it at one take ( because of its length and story ) , I liked it very much . I was impressed first , by the script and then , by the realization of this script . The film takes you on a ride , but that is not an easy , joyful ride ; it goes through time and different political regimes and shows the influence of them to ordinary people 's lives . What I loved was the inner logic the film followed ; logic , which just like logic in life , was rather illogical and confusing at times but in the end , when I thought about it , all the events and twists made sense . It makes no sense though to try to re-tell the story as it spreads in more than 50 years of time . I also liked very much Nikita Mikhalkov 's character Aleksei and the way he played it , as some critics would saw , with restless abandon . What I didn't like about it , was that I think he later played characters that remind me of Aleksei in films like " Cruel Romance " ( Zhestokij romans , which I actually love ) and to some extent in " The Insulted and the Injured " ( " Unizhennye i oskorblyonnye " ) . " Sibiriada " shows , I think , what a great film-maker Andrei Konchalovski was before he went to Hollywood and made forgettable films like " Tango and Cash " and less forgettable like " Runaway train " . I would prefer " Kurochka Ryaba " to them ..  
0	  This film has so little class in comparison to Strangers on a Train or even , Accidental Meeting for that matter , that despite plot similarities I wouldn't feel right in actually comparing this to either of them . The Yancy Butler character came across as such a dopey dimwit I was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watching . I don't enjoy many Lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home . I often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud , stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself , before I returned to my normally favorite chair to subject myself to more torture .

1	  I have to agree with everyone else that has posted . I watched it quite a while ago but I 'll tell you , whenever I hear certain music from this anime I am reminded of the story , the beautiful animation , the characters and the feeling I got when watching it , and it does make me cry ( such a happy yet sad feeling ) . I do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn't explain things properly but it didn't ruin any part of the viewing experience . I was into this anime so much that after the end I just had to do some research ( and watch the ending a few more times ) and I found all my answers and a whole lot more . I love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime , it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more . ( I 've always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime ) I do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely . I 'd recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story , well built characters ( some mysterious ) and a bit of fantasy action . Also , even though this was based on a H-game it doesn't have any of that stuff in it and I actually prefer it this way . ( I have no problem with mature anime , in most cases I prefer it )  
0	  Why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how ? Having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago , I can say that there is little if anything from the original book . I went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these . This is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name . This is not the story of Carlito Brigante , it is the story of a totally different character who 's been given the same name . They have just totally spat in the face of every Carlito 's Way fan out there ; adding insult to injury by casting Luis Guzman , who plays a crucial character in the original movie , in a different role . What 's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original , untouched material of the book Carlito 's Way - something I really would have liked to have seen . I felt the same way about Chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of Australia 's most feared underworld figure , instead they made a ho-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook ( though Eric Bana 's performance was spot-on ) . Now we will never get to see Carlito 's real initial rise and fall . The three stars is because , looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick , it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances ( Jay Hernandez is no Carlito but he could be good in other roles ) and the story is not too bad . Even Puffy Combs suits his role . But they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time ( I am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff ) - something which the original film and the books got right ( having been written by then attorney and now judge Edwin Torres ) . The fact is though , it 's not a stand alone - it 's perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed .  
1	  Felix Unger ( Jack Lemmon ) has just been dumped by his wife , because he is one of the most annoying , neurotic people in the world . Suicide is his way out , but he just can't seem to get it to work , so he heads over to his friends house . Oscar Madison ( Walther Matthau ) is also recently divorced and living it up in bachelor heaven . Smoking , gambling , hitting on chicks , eating out and never cleaning is paradise to him . Well , with the suicide attempts Oscar decides to let Felix move in . At first , it is a match made in heaven , Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oscar pay his alimony on time , but soon Oscar is jonesing for women and Felix ( who in today 's world would probably be gay ) isn't ready to move on . They invite a couple of British birds over and they find Felix so tender that soon they and Felix are weeping and chatting about his family life , leaving Oscar denied . This is it , he explodes and throws him out , but Felix isn't as helpless as it seems , and soon he has the upper hand . My favorite quote " You leave me little notes on my pillow . Told you 158 times I can't stand little notes on my pillow . " We 're all out of cornflakes . F.U. " Took me three hours to figure out F.U. was Felix Ungar ! " Based on a Neil Simon play ( who also wrote the screenplay ) , this has a certain theatre feel to it . Set and the repartee and looks feel quite play-like ( for better or worse ) . Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in the Grumpier Old Men movies and Out to Sea , reprising the same finicky / slob roles , but with different names ( to avoid royalty issues , I 'm sure ) . This movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate . The chocolate is smooth , sweet and rich , the strawberry is tart , juicy and bright red ( unless you get those nasty greenish ones ) . They are almost polar opposites , but together , the contrasts highlight each other and make a wonderful dessert . 7/10 $U$

1	  Often tagged as a comedy , The Man In The White Suit is laying out far more than a chuckle here and there . Sidney Stratton is an eccentric inventor who isn't getting the chances to flourish his inventions on the world because nobody pays him notice , he merely is the odd ball odd job man about the place as it were . After bluffing his way into Birnley 's textile mill , he uses their laboratory to achieve his goal of inventing a fabric that not only never wears out , but also never needs to be cleaned ! . He is at first proclaimed a genius and those who ignored him at first suddenly want a big piece of him , but then the doom portents of an industry going bust rears its head and acclaim quickly turns to something far more scary . Yes the film is very funny , in fact some scenes are dam hilarious , but it 's the satirical edge to the film that lifts it way above the ordinary to me . The contradictions about the advent of technology is a crucial theme here , do we want inventions that save us fortunes whilst closing down industries ? , you only have to see what happened to the coal industry in Britain to know what I 'm on about . The decade the film was made is a crucial point to note , the making of nuclear weapons became more than just hearsay , science was advancing to frighteningly new proportions . You watch this film and see the quick turnaround of events for the main protagonist Stanley , from hero to enemy in one foul swoop , a victim of his own pursuit to better mankind ! , it 's so dark the film should of been called The Man In The Black Suit . I honestly can't find anything wrong in this film , the script from Roger MacDougall , John Dighton , and director Alex Mackendrick could be filmed today and it wouldn't be out of place such is the sharpness and thought of mind it has . The sound and setting is tremendous , the direction is seamless , with the tonal shift adroitly handled by Mackendrick . Some of the scenes are just wonderful , one in particular tugs on the heart strings and brings one to think of a certain scene in David Lynch 's Elephant Man some 29 years later , and yet after such a downturn of events the film still manages to take a wink as the genius that is Alec Guinness gets to close out the film to keep the viewers pondering not only the future of Stanley , but also the rest of us in this rapidly advancing world . A timeless masterpiece , thematically and as a piece of art , 10/10 .  
0	  This movie blows - let 's get that straight right now . There are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot . Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in " 12 Monkeys " and acts in a similar manner . I normally hate Colin because he is a fairy in general but he 's OK in this movie . There were two plot lines in this movie - = one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache . Let 's face it - this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go . THe characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script . The whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional OK scene . But overall - Don't bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the Lucky Charms elf - an American fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success .  
1	  One of the most unheralded great works of animation . Though it makes the most sophisticated use of the " cut-out " method of animation ( a la " South Park " ) , the real talent behind " Twice Upon a Time " are the vocal characterizations , with Lorenzo Music 's ( Carlton from TV 's " Rhoda " ) Woody Allen-ish Ralph the all purpose Animal being the centerpiece . The " accidental nightmare " sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed .  
0	  Yet another British romantic comedy which audiences all over the world seem to have a ravenous appetite for . This feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre - all the classic clichéd scenes are here from ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to running after departing trains to declare one 's love . The characters are one-dimensional caricatures save for Love-Hewitt who manages to bring some cohesion to the film . Things threaten to spiral out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses ; our good-natured suspension of belief finally comes crashing down during the preposterous ending . If you 're looking for a Bridget Jones , Notting Hill kind of experience you won't find it here .  
1	  FORBIDDEN PLANET is the best SF film from the golden age of SF cinema and what makes it a great film is its sense of wonder . As soon as the spaceship lands the audience - via the ships human crew - travels through an intelligent and sometimes terrifying adventure . We meet the unforgetable Robbie , the mysterious Dr Morbuis , his beautiful and innocent daughter Altair and we learn about the former inhabitants of the planet - The Krell who died out overnight . Or did they ? You can nitpick and say the planet is obviously filmed in a movie studio with painted backdrops but that adds to a sense of menace of claustraphobia I feel and Bebe and Louis Barron ` s electronic music adds even more atmosphere I ` m shocked this film isn ` t in the top 250 IMDB films .  
0	  The show had great episodes , this is not one of them . It 's not a terrible episode , it 's just hard to follow up " The man that was death . " , " All through the house " , and " Dig that cat , he 's real gone . " This episode is about a couple that has just been married Peggy ( Ammanda Plummer ) and Charles ( Stephen Shellen ) . In the first five minutes you find out that Charles only married Peggy for her money . The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion . Charles soon finds out a secret of Peggy 's family .. In my opinion you should watch this episode , but just don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season .  
0	  The original " Cube " is a fantastic B-movie rich with paranoia , meaty characterization , and fine over-the-top performances . It 's creepy , cryptic , and cool . And it stands perfectly well , on its own , without a stupid sequel like " Cube Zero . " This third ( ! ) film in the Cube series is part retread ( most of the booby traps are sadly recycled ) , part aberration . It takes the bold step of explaining what the cube is - something that was never revealed in the first movie - but , since said explanation is bland , I 'd rather it was kept a secret . There are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside of the cube , but they never develop beyond hints about some kind of political-religious totalitarian state . So , what little social commentary there is feels flat and unfocused . What works ? Basically nothing . The acting is purely amateur hour , the pacing is slow ( how much of this movie consists of two nerds watching a screen ? ) , and the gore effects , while revolting , fail to convince . In short , " Cube Zero " reminded me of a " Cube " fan-fic , a sloppy and sophomoric clone of a good movie that definitely did not need a sequel .  
0	  I wasn't really hoping for much when I went to see this . After Mst3king the heck out of JasonX with some friends though , I was hoping for a similar experience here . Unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously . Do I care about Jason 's problems ? I 'm sorry no . There are a legion Ft13th movies that cover that anyway . At at then end of the day , he 's an undead serial killer , I 'm just not going to get that sympathetic . Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not , but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie , it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch .. only not funny .  
0	  It really was that bad . On a par with the ( mercifully ! ) short-lived " Dirty Dozen " TV series that starred Ben Murphy and was made at around the same time ( also on the cheap in Yugoslavia ) . I was embarrassed for the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular . He was waay too old and fat for the role ( pushing 70 when he made this garbage ) , and the reviewer who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in " The Green Berets " pretty much sums it up . Other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable howlers that this crime against celluloid contains , so I won't repeat them here . But I will add that I 'm amazed that no-one 's yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny-looking helmet that Savalas wears on his big , bloated head . I 'm also astonished that this trainwreck of a film has a rating as high as 4.7 here at IMDb . As far as I 'm concerned , it 's a " 1 " right across the board . If you want a good example of why flogging a franchise to death really is a bad idea ( especially 20-plus years after the original ) - look no further than " The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission " . Awful - avoid !  
0	  When you put this DVD into your player and hit " play , " you will experience a brief moment of silence and see a black screen as the laser is guided to the correct starting point in the center of the disc . CHERISH THIS MOMENT . Make sure you have some Tylenol or something ( preferably PM 's so you can fall asleep ) , because you 're going to have a massive headache once this movie starts . Starring a bunch of big-breasted girls and with an opening that actually made me chuckle a bit , I thought I 'd be in for a good time . Sure , the opening sequence was a WEE bit awkward and most of the jokes fell flat and it seemed like this was going to be a Scream ripoff ( by the way , my sole chuckle was from Julie Strain 's final comment in this scene ) . But then I knew there was trouble .. the opening sequence had a terrible rock song . During this terrible rock song , I looked over the DVD Chapter titles and saw things that said " TOPLESS IN THE BACKYARD ! " and " BETTER THAN SEX ! " . I knew what the selling point of this movie was going to be . And that 's the sad truth : The ONLY good thing about this movie is the attractive cast . Other than that , it 's a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an " innovative " concept about murder clubs , which ends up being fake anyway . So , the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery , but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you don't care for any of the characters . I mean , when the main character of the movie is revealed to have murdered an innocent woman , can you really feel ANY sympathy towards her when she 's in fear for her life ? The Scream influence is prevalent throughout , with a ghost face killer and some really terrible jokes . We 're also treated to scenes of the main character talking to her mom and dad ( Lloyd Kaufman ! The only other cool part of the movie ! ) about an abortion or something . Uh . Yeah .. This isn't a " so bad it's good " movie , it 's just BAD . Someone compared this to a Troma film , but .. you know , most any film that comes from Full Moon ( or its offshoot , as this film proves ) is horrible . NOT horrible in a Troma sense - I 've seen many Troma films , and I can honestly say they all offer something , ANYTHING that you can walk away with and tell your friends about later . However , this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it . Beware .  
1	  If you ever have the chance to see Sandra Bernhard live in person , you better move on it sweetie . I saw her last year in Los Angeles at the opening of her Everything Bad and Beautiful tour and i still can't believe that i was in the first row , and lucky enough to experience such a phenomenal show . She is now in New York with the show and it coincides with the release of her groundbreaking stunner , " Without You I 'm Nothing " . We have lost Richard Pryor , Lenny Bruce , Nina Simone , but Sandra is still with us . Patti Smith is missing in action , but not Sandra . Barbara Streisand continues to peep her head out once in awhile but Sandra more than makes up for where Babs leaves off . Okay , i want it known , Ms . Bernhard is a little of these influential entertainers and more . I really wanted to push this film because of its truth , honesty , humor , eclectic songs ( ranging from Laura Nyro , Sylvester , Nina Simone , Prince ) , and a script that defines the decadence , joy , sadness , ups and downs of the 70 's and 80 's . It is my opinion that many ( and i mean , MANY ) comics have lifted , okay outright stolen , so much from this show if not from Sandra herself . I won't name names but come on , people , you and i know who they are . See , the thing is , Bernhard plays by her own rules . This movie shows , as does her live performances , that she is a performer who has stayed true to the old school of show business , as well as pushing forward . Her performances are reminiscent of smoky jazz clubs ( during the time of Miles Davis , Coltrane , Monk ) , 70 's TV shows , intimate cabaret acts and concerts that are reminiscent of everyone from Judy Garland to Joan Jett . Most comedians couldn't even touch where Sandra is coming from or going to . So , here i was , a year ago , watching Sandra at the Silent Movie Theater , in total awe and joy . I wanted to meet her after the show , give her something that meant something to me , that , hopefully would mean something to her . But i listen to my copy of Giving Til it Hurts , and just thank her in a prayer , of sorts for making me laugh , making me think , making me FEEL . You can't deny this lady 's presence and you certainly cannot deny the talent that just rushes from the stage . She 's still here , damn it , even after the release of Without You I 'm Nothing , some 15 years ago . And she looks great , by the way . I know this firsthand , walking from the theater one audience member said to another , " She is SO FUNNY .. and she still looks incredible ! If you can't experience her live yet , please see this movie . As for me , I do hope that Sandra will see this . You 've meant a heck of a lot to me , gotten me through some tough crazy times . If you can send me an email , please do . If not , knowing that you are still kicking it out and will continue to do so , is enough for me . Come on , people , give it up for the Lady !  
0	  This dreadful film assembles every Asian stereotype you can imagine into one hideous package . Money grubbing , devious Japanese business men send goofy but loveable policeman Pat Morita to recover industrial secrets in Detroit . Here he encounters a down at heel Jay Leno , who promptly refers to a murder victim as a Jap and calls Morita Tojo . It 's all downhill from there .  
1	  Let 's think people , quit bad-mouthing the original , for it 's time the original Battlestar series was a masterpiece , even still with all the stars , story lines and art . Lorne Greene was great as Adama and Richard Hatch was perfect as Apollo and Dirk Benedict was funny as Starbuck , but I dare say , not as pretty as Katee as Starbuck . I loved the episode with the Pegasus and Greetings from Earth was good John Calicos was great as Baltar , War of the Gods , the best was Experiment in Terra , I thought that was a tribute in a way to Heaven Can Wait , then you had the women of Battlestar , not to compare them to let 's say Tricia who is outstandingly beautiful as Number Six , but Jane Seymour 's beauty could not be compared to . Let alone Loerrta Spang as Cassiopea was fantastic . She had beauty that a rainbow would be embarrassed by . I loved the original as much as the new . Can you imagine if John Calicos had a number six ? :) Thankyou for listening .  
1	  I loved so much about this movie .. the time taken to develop the characters , the attention to detail , the superb performances , the stunning lighting and cinematography , the wonderful soundtrack .. It has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick . If we lived in Elizabethan days , I 'd say this movie 's a bit like a Shakespearean tragedy . But since we don't , let 's say it 's more like a Drama-Suspense movie . The plot is simple , but the story is complex . The movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored . Much of the story is shown rather than told , which I find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book ( or graphic novel ) . At times I felt I was actually there in the 1930s , part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling . I don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon , but in this case I do . ( Though I did enjoy the book too . ) I 've bought the DVD , which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary . ( I also took my little cousin , who 's a little younger than the boy in the movie , to see it after I saw it for the first time , because he has issues at home and I wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him . He loved it - and the discussion . )  
1	  Eva ( Hedy Lamarr ) has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon , she realizes that her husband does not desire her . Her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love , makes Eva returning to her father 's home in a farm , leaving her husband . One afternoon , while bathing in a lake , her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to Eva . They fall in love for each other and become lovers . Later , her husband misses her and tries to have Eva back home . Eva refuses , and fortune leads the trio to the same place , ending the affair in a tragic way . I have just watched " Extase " for the first time , and the first remark I have is relative to the horrible quality of the VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Video Network : the movie has only 75 minutes running time , and it seems that it was used different reels of film . There are some parts totally damaged , and other parts very damaged . Therefore , the beauty of the images in not achieved by the Brazilian viewer , if he has a chance to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale . The film is practically a silent movie , the story is very dated and has only a few lines . Consequently , the characters are badly developed . However , this movie is also very daring , with the exposure of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty . Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers , symbolizing the intercourse between Eva and her lover . The way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of Eva is very clear . The non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie . I liked this movie , but I hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version . My vote is eight . Title ( Brazil ) : " Êxtase " ( " Ecstasy " )  
0	  .. as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates . Barely even reaching feature length , " Can I Do It .. ' Till I Need Glasses " is a collection of ( mostly ) dirty jokes . Many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize that THAT was supposed to be the punchline ( example : the Santa Claus gag ) ; others are so long that you can't believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up THAT punchline ( example : the students ' awards gag ) . And nearly all are directed without any artistry . Don't get me wrong : about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny ( the iron / phone one is probably my favorite ) . There is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves , yet again , that the female body , especially in its natural form , is the best thing on this planet ( there is some comedic male nudity as well ) . And I agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy ! But none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than * out of 4 .  
0	  This sword - & - sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous " hero " vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail . The acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles . The leering , gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting ; nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause , since he is as bad as the people he 's fighting . Z-movie editing is abundant , including a scene where a character " dies " from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely ! The movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads , Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson , who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie . As a 20-something male , I will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesn't attract me . But the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless , that I couldn't enjoy even this aspect of the movie . Most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light-hearted , tongue-in-cheek feel ( the sequel is better in this regard ) , but DEATHSTALKER seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy . No way ! Avoid at all costs ! Rating : 1/2 out of * .  
0	  Would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball . This movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level . In this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp . He is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra . This movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world , the acting was awful and I think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it .  
1	  this was a very good movie i wished i could find it in vhs to buy , i really enjoyed this movie i would definaetly recommend this movie to watch i would like to see it again but can never find it in tv , it would be well worth the time to watch it again  
1	  At least something good came out of Damon Runyon 's misguided attempt to sentimentalize the Mafia . " Guys and Dolls , " the seemingly indestructible stage musical , was captured on film in 1955 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz ( " All About Eve " ) in a colorful , enjoyable movie that featured an all-star cast including Vivian Blaine ( from the original Broadway show ) , Jean Simmons ( whose character bears an odd resemblance to Audrey Hepburn in " Roman Holiday " ) and two of the all-time great leading men , Frank Sinatra and Marlon Brando , both of whom had recently won Oscars for Best Supporting Actor ( " From Here To Eternity " ) and Best Actor ( " On the Waterfront " ) and were on the top of their game . One listen to Brando singing " Luck Be a Lady Tonight " speaks volumes about where the early Dylan got his voice . Stubby Kaye steals the show as Nicely Nicely Johnson , who brings down the house with " Sit Down You 're Rocking The Boat . " The ubiquitous Sheldon Leonard adds yet another page to his rogue 's gallery of screen gangsters . The film has a bright , cartoonish look , anticipating the Pop Art of the early 1960s . The characters speak in a stylized patois , apparently based on Yiddish idioms . Although the film 's social attitudes and gender roles are dated , it 's all great fun , and even the gentle kidding of the Salvation Army is harmless and reflects no real animosity toward organized religion . Just seeing Sinatra and Brando in the same film is reason enough to watch this movie , but it has lots of other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes .  
0	  Necessarily ridiculous film version the literary classic " Moby Dick " . John Barrymore is Captain Ahab , who falls in love with the pastor 's daughter , Joan Bennett . His brother Derek is a rival for Ms . Bennett 's affections . When Mr. Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident , Bennett rejects him . He must slay the whale and win Bennett back .. There are several scenes which may have thrilled 1930 theater audiences ; particularly the scenes involving Barrymore losing his leg . The film hasn't aged well , however ; there are much better films from the time , both 1920s silents and 1930s talkies . The two name attractions , John Barrymore and Joan Bennett aren't at their best . * Moby Dick ( 8/14/30 ) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore , Joan Bennett , Lloyd Hughes  
1	  William Powell 's final outing as Philo Vance occurs in The Kennel Murder Case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human kind . It 's all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and why . The Philo Vance murders by S.S. Van Dine were most popular at the time and the clever Mr. Van Dine figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder . This is why you see so many Philo Vances and so many studios putting them out . Had Bill Powell not gone on to greater fame with MGM as Nick Charles of the Thin Man series , he would have been known as the greatest of Philo Vances . It turns out that Powell had entered his little terrier Captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim . As usual Powell shows up Eugene Palette as Sergeant Heath whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was using his bulk to break down the locked from the inside door where the first murder victim was found . I did say locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was in figuring out the how . Powell has a lovely group of suspects , as extensive as what normally is in a Thin Man mystery . People like Paul Cavanaugh , Helen Vinson , Ralph Morgan , Mary Astor , fill their cast roles well . Warner Brothers liked this version so much that in fact they remade it again in the Thirties with James Stephenson in his one and only outing as Philo Vance . It doesn't hold a candle to this one . As this is the only Powell Philo Vance that is out on VHS or DVD by all means see this one or acquire it if you can .  
0	  This movie is all ultra-lightweight fluff , predictable from beginning to end . As a Don Knotts vehicle , " The Incredible Mr. Limpet " was much better , with Knott 's character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant . His performance there was toned down , with none of his trademark goggle-eyed stare , although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish . Knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile , much as Bob Denver did . Neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles , assuming they were simply typecast . It was probably because of the slouch , the wild stare and the high-pitched voice . John Ritter , whom Knotts worked with in " Three 's Company , " was able to transcend his genre , branching out successfully into dramatic roles like " The Dreamer of Oz , " but the closest Knotts ever got was a small role in " Pleasantville . " Even Leslie Nielsen was a bad fit here , uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in " Airplane ! " and " Police Squad . " There 's also no way the then-43 year-old Knotts could pass for a 35 year-old , as his character insisted he was . It was as ludicrously unbelievable as Tom Hanks at 38 playing the college-age Forrest Gump . The film was clearly made on a shoestring budget , very much looking like a hastily-filmed TV episode . It 's especially evident in the " exterior " scenes of the " town " where Roy goes after he 's fired . It 's unlikely even a pre-schooler would be fooled by the Mayberry-like soundstage artificiality . Even viewing this strictly as a children 's movie , it 's very disappointing . It 's not because it lacks action or special effects , although it does . The pace is much too slow , the situations repetitive . How many times can you watch Roy getting onto a bus ? A comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap , with breakneck gags , otherwise you risk boring them ( and any adults in the theater as well ) . Movies , even kid 's movies , have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades . Even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written . Disney 's " The Love Bug , " for instance , at least had some interesting race action .  
0	  Writer / Director Peter Greenaway cements his title as the High Lord of Art House Pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self-indulgence , 8 ½ Women . The film follows a wealthy Englishman and his son on their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction , as they lure and blackmail women ( guess how many ) into joining their personal collection of concubines . Think of any possible way that this premise could be offensive , and chances are Greenaway 's done it . The female characters are little more than a catalogue of fetishes for the two protagonists to partake of . There 's the Kabuki-obsessed Mio , the ever-pregnant Giaconda and Beryl , who 's got a thing for farm animals . Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair , she 's the " half woman , " get it ? Greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny , but if this isn't it , then what is ? The film goes on to eroticize anything and everything having to do with Japan , a continuation of themes from his snore-worthy ( but less sexist ) 1996 film , The Pillow Book . But where the The Pillow Book was erotic and graceful , 8 ½ Women just gets horny and exploitative . Greenaway 's work is tasteless and arrogant in its fetishism , and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the auteur himself .  
1	  I only saw it once . This happened in 1952 , I was seven , the movie 13 . We were so young .. But I kept in mind , forever , the strong moments of Gunga 's sacrifice . I realized that time how much a people can be hardly submitted and used by a foreign nation . Under these historical circumstances , in the movie , the personal relation of friendship , a kind of friendship that ignores itself , the one raised between people who share daily life , who see each other faces , who knows each other names , but belong to different worlds , can only make appears . Then , in the most critical moments a troubling question emerges : " Whom are we , in first , supposed to be loyal ? " , which People , family , motherland , the person you know close to you ? . You do not have time to give a perfect answer , urgency is there , and it is for life or death . Gunga-Din gives his answer with sacrifice of himself . Somewhere , in a confuse manner , a problem remains unsolved , the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until somebody dies , just one life , nothing compared to so many other fictions or realities we can see today , because this death , this unique vanishing life I lived it , I shared with my child unconditional friendship . It was lived by the spectator I was . That day I loose Gunga-Din for ever . As I left behind , later , my pretty childhood , as I left from then so many worlds I lived in . I left all that for good and these lines are today a short visit I didn't expect to do this morning when getting up .  
1	  Certainly one of the finest movies I have seen for quite some time . Exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film . Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date , and the rest of the cast perform beautifully . Christopher Walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as I would have liked . A story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love . This is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets , rockets and revenge . The location of Mexico City adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener . All in all , a truly gripping film from beginning to end . Highly recommended !  
1	  One of the unsung gems of the 1980 's , Scenes .. features razor-sharp satire and outstanding performances from Arnetia Walker ( how did she not get a ton of roles after this ? ) and Wallace Shawn . It 's a delicious send-up of class warfare and the people in those classes . The writing is hilarious and the characters , while not subtle , are nuanced . And , sorry , but the Asian gangs ( if you can call one Japanese guy extorting one of the other characters a " gang " ) were not put in for " sociological value " as another review implies they should been . The value here lies in what the movie is making fun of and in the sparklingly wicked way it does it . I found it creative , funny , and idiosyncratic .  
1	  I don't agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the American International Pictures . Basil Deardon has directed a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post war England ( but without the sentimentality of " Blackboard Jungle " ) . The cinematography was excellent as it really captured the scariness and isolation of the huge housing estate . The estate looked like an old prison . Stanley Baker was excellent as the hardened detective , reassigned to the juvenile division - " Urgent , urgent - Larceny - five iced lollies " ! He finds he is the butt of many jokes . David McCallum showed that he was one of Britain 's top young talents of the fifties . ( He had a very different role in another Stanley Baker film " Hell Drivers " ) . His portrayal of Johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening . Ann Heywood was also very good as the cynical Cathie . I wouldn't say there was a romantic subplot in it . Detective Jack Truman is investigating a string of arson attacks by someone labeled the " Firefly " . Just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough , he is assigned to the Juvenile Division - he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work . Amid all the heckling he gets his first call out - the 6 year old Murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly shops ! Taking the twins home he meets their brother , the charismatic Johnny , and their embittered sister Cathie . He starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly housing estates can turn young kids into criminals . As he gets more involved with the family , he realises there is a strong link between the fires , Johnny and a frightened Chinese youth who works for a laundry . The local priest ( Peter Cushing in an unusual role , away from the Hammer horrors ) explains that when Johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been hailed a hero . He wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires . The school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children 's fear - the teacher ( thinking only of her own safety ) runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman ! I thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems Britain experienced after the war . Highly Recommended .  
1	  Having lived in Ontario my whole life , in the same town that Marlene Moore grew up in , I 've heard stories of her from my parents , grandparents and family members . So when I found out that they would be filming a movie about her , and that the beginning would be shot on my street , and her house quite close to mine I was excited . If you read the book Rock a Bye Baby , which is about Marlene Moore you get quite the different image of her as a person , she was considered awkwardly beautiful by people who really had the chance to know her with the exception of her own family who frequently abused her as a child , with the exception of one of her brothers . Also , if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school you 'd find out that she was truly wounded before she even set foot in an institution , she was always defensive and what would seem like an unwillingness to learn in a school environment was actually embarrassment over the fact that she was unable to . Marlene did not deserve the life she was given , with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive . It was the government and the people around her that aided further in her death by not attempting to understand her needs and why she did what she did . I still find myself angered that she was put in jail for self-defense from a man who tried to rape her . As her brother once said , " They didn't know what to do with her so they locked her away and it killed her . " I believe in that with all my heart . Rest in peace Marlene , you deserve it so much .  
1	  Fidois a very odd film . And in many ways , a very good one . My first thought after viewing , was how the hell are they going to market this thing ? If Shaun of the Dead is a romantic comedy with zombies , Fido is a boy and his dog story blended with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies . Doesn't exactly trip off the tongue . Fido has little of Shaun 's carnage , gore & belly laughs . It is a different beast altogether ( forgive the pun ) . Fido kicks off with a black & white information film that explains the back story - humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that subdues the flesh-eaters into dumb servants . At first I thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la Matinée , but we are soon hurled into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle-class nostalgia . Young Timmy Robinon is a lonely kid who doesn't fit in at school . His mom is would-be social climber , and his dad is nervy and detached . Seeking to keep up with the Joneses , mom ( Carry-Anne Moss ) has acquired a zombie . Jimmy is disinterested at first , but ' Fido ' ( Billy Conelley ) soon proves a great buddy for Jimmy . Until his collar goes on the blink .. Fido is NOT a horror film , but my problem with the movie is figuring out exactly what it IS . Much of the humour is of the light family variety , and sometimes the plot line is too heavily reliant on the boy and his dog / family moments . Yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark , truly funny moments , which while welcome , will ensure an R rating for what is , for extended periods , a family comedy . The film looks gorgeous , and is wonderfully performed by all involved . Despite its difficult tonal problems , I hope this movie finds a niche , as it 's quite a little gem in this year 's deluge of cinematic crap .  
0	  Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came out in 1993 , supposedly based on the Japanese sentai television show that started back in the 1970s . Now as a fan of Japanese action films and series , you would think I would get a kick out of this show . You could not be more wrong . What worked in the Japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphin power rangers . MMPR is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot . Now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either Transformers movie , yet , the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked . It was followed by two really bad , and I do mean , really bad movie knock offs , and the actors starring in this series , completely disappeared from the scene . If you must choose , try watching Japan 's Zyuranger series instead . Also , what 's up with the awful long 1990s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys ? It makes them all look feminine !  
1	  All in all a good film and better for the fact that had the film not been made the story might remain hidden to the masses . Brosnan does a good job as the native American with a hidden past and the photography is stunning . To some , this may be too whimsical , to others boring - for me it is a gentle , well-told tale and perfect for family viewing . Now that 's not something you get a lot of recently .  
0	  I have read the book a couple of times and this movie doesn't follow exactly as it should . I could let this slide , it is after all a movie . However I have serious issues with the setting of the movie . Nobody has seemed to mention that this movie and the book it is based on are based in actual events that happened in Nebraska . I live in Nebraska . I grew up in the town that this movie is supposed to be based on . First of all , the " small " town that is talked about as the setting , is the third largest city in the state . With a population of around 50,000 . Grand Island is the largest city between Lincoln and Denver . Second the scenery for the movie is wrong . Grand Island is in the Platte river valley . Which is very flat with very few trees . I tried watching this movie , but it made me mad to see my hometown being treated so bad . This was a real event . Large sections of the city were wiped out . In the book they talk about riding bikes from Mormon Island to Fonner Park . I guess you could if you don't mind a 15 mile ride each way . For anyone who wants to know what really happened go here $U$  
1	  I enjoyed this film far more than anything had led me to anticipate ; from reading other comments here , I suspect it benefits enormously from being seen on a full-size screen in the cinema , in the company of a cheerful and enthusiastic audience . I was lucky enough to have that experience , borne up on ripples of laughter from all around , and had an immensely good time with this undemanding comedy . For it is as a comedy that it shines , if it shines anywhere at all . The music is nothing special - in fact , I hadn't realised it * was * a musical , and was very surprised when the assembled ancestors burst into half-spoken lyric - but I do have to admit that the half-threat , half-promise of ' Oh , what I 'll do .. ' has proved far more catchy than it ever seemed at the time , as it 's still going round and round in my head ! The plot , such as it is , largely pivots around the past history of the eponymous Francesca , a sixteenth-century portrait sporting a distinctly anachronistic hairstyle and fur-coat . Her idea on the sanctity of marriage don't quite jibe with those of her distant descendant , the Countess Angelina , and one can almost hear the storyline creaking at the seams under the strain of the Production Code in order to ensure that the heroine arrives unsullied in her much-delayed marriage-bed with the right man .. The romance is scarcely earth-shattering , and in fact the first few scenes , played pretty well straight , verge on the tedious . But where script and film really come to life is in the battle of the sexes that follows . The impudence of Douglas Fairbanks Jr 's courtship of Betty Grable 's married Angelina is equalled only by Betty Grable as Francesca 's pursuit of him in turn , culminating in complete role-reversal in the hilarious fantasy sequence where she - literally - sweeps him off his feet . This is probably the comic climax of the plot , although the consequences of the Colonel 's understandable confusion are worked out with a deft touch in the remaining two ' acts ' of the operetta-structure , and the spectacle of Fairbanks ' blissful , bemused awakening is more or less worth the price of admission on its own . Grable is entirely convincing in establishing her two contrasting characters , wisely gets almost all the ( limited ) singing opportunities , and shares the honours where the swathes of quotable dialogue in the various verbal duels are concerned . But in the field of unspoken reaction she is really outclassed by her male supporting leads ; Fairbanks in particular is an absolute treat in a number of wordless sequences whose set-up and humour is worthy of the silent screen . This film is too uneven in style to be a classic , varying from sparkling repartee to hackneyed tedium . But at its best it is quite honestly very funny indeed , and brought a round of spontaneous applause and laughter across the auditorium at the end as the lights went up . Out of tune with its times , it may have failed to draw contemporary audiences - but , on this showing , really didn't deserve to be disowned by both Grable and Preminger , the ( uncredited ) director . This is no masterpiece , but a thoroughly entertaining minor work , and I for one found myself grinning in remembrance all the way home .  
0	  If Alien , Jurassic Park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea , add a lot of sugar and you 'll get this one down . The film begins in jolly old England around 1100ad and then jumps to present day California . Our hero Carver ( Dean Cain ) is the new Security Chief and Military Advisor for a Science Lab 400 feet underground . He arrives ( Carver is also a helicopter pilot ) with the lead Scientist and we soon find out it 's a cloning lab and they have something newly found to clone . Is it a Dinosaur or what ? As with the above movies , all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting picked off . The special effects on the Monster are pretty good for a " direct to video " movie and Dean Cain does what he gets paid for . But forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before . Again , don't go in with high expectations and you 'll be ok .  
1	  okay , but just plain dumb . Not bad for a horror / comedy film . I was reading how people switched it with the Michael version and that is a good trick in my opinion because some grown ups hate horrors and when they see this one it will get them interested in horror films like this one or maybe ( never seen it ) the horror ( possibly comedy ) uncle Sam , i 'll have to see about renting or buying that film but the 2nd is way better then this one but i bought this one on VHS of Amazon and got it November 21 , the day before thanksgiving . worth the four bucks , l . o . l . at this film . 9/10  
0	  Paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt . It does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood , and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences . Unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife , a conflict over a road construction project , the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters , a mysterious man who lives in the woods , a bunch of racist hooligans , at least three different carnivals , the intricacies of local church politics , and on and on and on . And all of that doesn't even include the actual central plot , which is only about the hopes , dreams , and frustrations of two girls ( and their entire families ) at the turning point of their lives . I was actually shocked when I realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer ( and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours ! ) Ultimately the movie is melodramatic , every plot point is predictable , major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later .. and some of those events are extremely distasteful . Most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime ( in a totally predictable " twist " ) and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on . Similarly , a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another " twist . " It 's all totally mechanical , right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends ( well not all of them , just the ones the movie thinks you care about . )  
0	  I 'm all for a " bad " horror movie but this was just a pile of dog sh ! t ! How anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me . If you like rushed editing to cover the special effects , bad acting and a bad script then go for it ! There was no suspense whatsoever and the gore factor was laughable because it was so fake . I 'll take Hostel or Wolf Creek over this pile any day . My partner gave up after about 20 minutes , she knows a stinker when she sees one . I on the other hand stupidly sat through the whole movie just to wait and see if it got any better . No such luck ! I haven't sen his other movie Torched and I doubt if I 'll bother now .  
0	  Tierney 's an authentic tough guy , but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn . The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner . Just count the times Tierney 's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts . The old cliché about it " only happening in the movies " applies here in spades . Then there 's the guy playing the watchman , who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy , ruining the menacing mood in the process . The static one-room sets don't help either , and neither does director Feist 's obvious lack of feel for the material . Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off , and the results are pretty flat . In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants . Too bad that Tieney 's career never really gelled . I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another . His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best . Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play , but as a movie with a promising noir title , it 's a disappointment .  
1	  I first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it . Charles Dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine . His sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the crudely good hero . I have never been much of an Eddie Murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner : a bit of " Axel Foley Through the Looking Glass " . Charlotte Lewis is , to utilize a hackneyed phrase but the only one applicable , luminously gorgeous . Some scenes are wonderfully created : the dream sequence , the bird , the silly fight scenes , and the climactic confrontation . Through it all Murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth , a stunned and quieter version of Kurt Russell in his oriental fantasy romp . Like that movie we have James Hong , the incomparable actor whose scenes , however short , raise the quality even of Derek . Since 1955 Hong has defined the fine supporting actor , the " class act " of his profession . " The Golden Child " is silly ; it is not perfect ; but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy , well worth watching . After four years I have seen " The Golden Child " again ; I enjoyed it even more ! It truly is great fun .  
1	  I have to start saying it has been a long time since I have seen it , but have seen it 5 or more times ; a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical / comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence . Kay Kyser 's mysteries would be a good example . Having Spike Jones unleashed is the best part of the show , as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action , doing a fine job of support . Hugh O'Brien plays the face , Buddy Hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to Lou Costello and thus , Abbott and Costello replacing the leads . Don't know if that was true . all in all , a pleasant movie , but important to have that much Spike Jones and his band on film for history . Wish that it was released , as I haven't seen or heard of it now in two decades . Hope it is not lost  
0	  This movie was terrible . The plot sucked , the acting was bad , the editing was inept and this movie makes me want to poke my eyes out . I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie back . The balloon scene was stupid , the Mormon jokes are really old , the soundtrack sucked , I saw no chemistry between the two leads , it 's full of stereotypes , stupid local " celeb " cameo 's .. most noted was Del " I 'm going to drive as fast as I want to .. " computer idiot . What is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even they screwed that up . This movie help create a long line of lackluster efforts to mainstream LDS beliefs into Hollywood . I.E. The RM , Church ball , etc . etc . I would forgo watching this movie and instead run head first into a brick wall . You will be more entertained than watching this poor excuse for a show .  
0	  I thought this was a great idea but , boy , was it poorly executed . We do get a broad sense of how complex and challenging the backstage operations of a show are , but virtually no specifics about any of it works . The producers don't seem to have found any way to tell a story or give the viewer a " through-line . " ( Which is not to say they didn't try , but having the stagehands relate a synopsis of the Ring cycle as the program 's narrative does nothing to tell us about the job of physically mounting an opera . ) We see lots of things happening , but are told little about what it is that the people are doing and why . There 's little sense of who is who , or how the various production departments fit and work together . For instance , several times we hear about a problem of some sort - one expects then to see the problem and its consequences and / or how it gets resolved . But instead the filmmakers generally just cut to something else ( generally , pretty generic footage of people pushing stuff or talking into headsets . ) Overall the film ends up feeling more like a pastiche of images that you 'd see run under the closing credits of a show , rather than anything worth watching for its own merit .  
1	  This is not " so bad that it is good , " it is purely good ! For those who don't understand why , you have the intellect of a four year old ( in response to a certain comment .. ) Anyways , Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself , a parody of you , and a parody of me . It is the single most genius text in cinematic history . I have it and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa . It embodies the recognition of absurdity and undermines all that you or me call standard . I write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of comedy for me , the likes of which we have never seen . It can only be taken in portions .. its sort of exploitive .. by now I 'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum . My comment ended a while ago . Hopefully it works when I submit it now .  
1	  I originally saw this film years ago during Cinemax Friday after dark series ( back when the cable box was built like a keyboard ) , and it intrigued me . Even though there is a pointless aspect to the film it is well acted . The performances of Depardieu & Dewaere are very enjoyable . They have a good chemistry together & Miou-Miou makes a pink fur look breathtaking . A movie like this probably wouldn't be made in these politically correct times ( at least not in the US ) , since it seems to sensationalize things like violence , robbery , & casual sex . This movie proves that with a talented cast & also talented directing a good movie is a good movie no matter the subject . It saddened me to find out Patrick Dewaere committed suicide & in the near future I , ll will check him out with Depardieu & Miou-Miou in Get Out Your Hankerchief .  
0	  Elfriede Jelinek , not quite a household name yet , is a winner of the Nobel prize for literature . Her novel spawned a film that won second prize at Cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads . Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes ? ' Gobble , gobble ' is the favoured orthographic representation in Britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey . In the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception . ' Gobble , gobble ' and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners . The embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be overstated . It begins very badly , as if made to annoy the viewer . Credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes . We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut , apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress , a stony professor of piano . She lives with her husky and domineering mum . Dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action . Reviewing The Piano Teacher is difficult , beyond registering its unpleasantness . What we see in the film ( and might read in the book , for all I know ) is a tawdry , exploitative , nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on . Erika , whose name is minimally used , is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed . Not quite , because there 's a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly-voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies . If a reviewer has to ( yawn ) extract a leitmotif ( why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do ) , Elrika 's violently alternating moods would be it . A young hunk , Walter , studying to become a ' low voltage ' engineer , whatever that is , and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments , is also a talented pianist . He encounters Elrika at an old-fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris . In the glib fashion of so much art , he immediately falls in love and starts to ' cherchez la femme ' . Repressed Erika has a liking for hardcore pornography , shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches . Walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by Erika , whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness , hostility , discouragement and humiliation . He soon declares his love and before long pursues Erika into the Ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex . Erika retains control over her lovesick swain . She promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges . In the meantime , chillingly jealous because of Walter 's kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert , Erika fills the student 's coat pocket with broken glass , causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano-playing hands . The next big scene ( by-passing the genital self-mutilation , etc ) has Walter turning up at the apartment Erika shares with her mother . Erika want to be humiliated , bound , slapped , etc . Sensible Walter is , for the moment , repulsed and marches off into the night . At this point there 's still nearly an hour to go . The viewer can only fear the worst . Erika tracks down Walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice . They retire to a back room . Lusty Wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers . His ' baby gravy ' is soon expelled with other stomach contents . Ho hum . Repulsed but hooked , perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor , Walter returns to Erika 's apartment . Can you guess what happens now ? It 's not very deep or difficult . Yes , he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim . One moment he 's locking maman in her room and slapping Erika , the next he 's kicking her in the face , having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love . Am I being unfair in this summary ? Watch the film if you want , but I 'd advise you not to . Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they 're in the right mood . I could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if I wanted . But I ' prefer not to ' , because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing . I 'm supposed to say that parentally repressed Erika longs for love , ineffectively seeks it in pornography , inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears , pink and throbbing , under her nose , belatedly realises that she doesn't like being hurt , blah , blah , blah . The world has , for reasons not explained , stunted her . She apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving - but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist , because that 's his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise . At the end , if you have the patience to be there , there 's a small twist . Before going to the final scene , where she 's due to perform as a substitute for the underwear-soiling student with the lacerated hands , Erika packs a knife in her handbag . For Walter ? Yes , you 're ahead of me . She stabs herself in a none life-threatening area and leaves . Roll credits . If this earned the second prize at Cannes , just how bad were the rest of the entries ?  
1	  Taken in the context of the time it was made , I found this a worthwhile movie . While the details may be ' dramatized ' , the overall history was a nice primer . In addition , I found spotting actors I knew a real pleasure . Who would imagine Ben Cartwright as a dastardly cad ? I 'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you . As to the secondary casting , this movie ( as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties ) has many an enjoyable character actor , but top kudos ' to Andrew Jackson 's right hand man Peavey . The perfect touch of comedy . Well shot , with beautiful ships , and competent acting throughout out , I recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp , or an eye for a double-period piece , set at the dawn of America , and made in a period when great names , and top notch character actors , were a real pleasure to enjoy .  
1	  Director Kinka Usher stays true to his own credo , " Play it straight and they will laugh , " and with the help of a superb cast has crafted what should become the # 1 cult film of all time , ` Mystery Men . ' When an evil villain , Casanova Frankenstein ( Geoffrey Rush ) is released from a mental institution , captures the local superhero , Captain Amazing ( Greg Kinnear ) , and threatens to take over Champion City , three wanna-be superheroes , Mr. Furious ( Ben Stiller ) , The Shoveler ( William H. Macy ) and The Blue Raja ( Hank Azaria ) come to the rescue . Frankenstein has been joined by a myriad assortment of underworld scum , however , and has become a formidable opponent . The trio realize that help is needed , and decide to recruit ; what they end up with is nothing less than the most unforgettable team of ` superheroes ' ever assembled in the history of the cinema . Mr. Furious has his rage ; The Shoveler , his shovel ; The Blue Raja flings silverware ( mainly forks , and the occasional spoon , but never a knife ) ; the Invisible Boy ( Kel Mitchell ) can turn invisible as long as no one is watching ; the Sphinx ( Wes Studi ) , a heavy hitter from down south , is very mysterious and can break guns in half with his mind . Maybe ; the Bowler ( Janeane Garofalo ) can fling a ball with deadly accuracy ; and The Spleen ( Paul Reubens ) wields flatulence that can incapacitate an entire room . This is a brilliant ensemble piece that delivers the laughs without ever becoming condescending or patronizing the audience , while playing it straight at all times . The dialogue is witty , and the performances given by Stiller , Macy , Azaria and Garofalo are exemplary . There is a number of memorable , hilarious scenes , especially the one in which they throw a pool party and barbecue to recruit , and conduct interviews with a stupefying assemblage of applicants ; and another , in a bar , when the Bowler has a conversation with her long-dead father , whose skull has been implanted in her bowling ball . The funniest of all , however , has to be when the team actually attempts to rescue Captain Amazing . But these are only examples , for the entire movie is composed of one hilarious scene after another , laced with subtle humor that will keep you laughing and thinking about it for a long time . The real secret of it 's success , though , is that Usher keeps it all real ; the relationships between the characters are true , and the whole concept of being a ` Superhero ' is played as being entirely reasonable , which somehow gives a sense of credibility to the entire proceedings . In this world , the aspirations of Mr. Furious and the rest are tenable , and Usher keeps the laughs coming without ever resorting to slapstick or mere sight gags . The solid supporting cast includes Lena Olin ( Dr. Annabel Leek ) , Eddie Izzard ( Tony P. ) , Tom Waits ( Doc Heller ) , Claire Forlani ( Monica ) , Louise Lasser ( The Blue Raja 's mother ) , Jenifer Lewis ( Lucille ) and Pras ( Tony C. ) . ` Mystery Men ' is a truly inspired movie that can be seen over and over again , with a new chuckle to be had with every viewing , guaranteed . In the immortal words of the Sphinx , ` We are number one ! All others are number two , or lower . ' Is it an Oscar-worthy movie ? Hardly ; but for a good time and a lot of laughs , treat yourself to this masterwork of comedy ; it 's the real deal , and you won't regret it . I rate this one 10/10 .  
0	  There is not a single sympathetic character in this entire movie . Is it the lawyer played by Kenneth Branagh that we 're supposed to be pulling for ? Well , let 's see - we learn he 's a sleazebag defense attorney who gets criminals off on technicalities . He treats his coworkers like cattle , gets them involved in his own personal crisis ( in the process , getting one of them killed ) , jeopardizes the safety of his kids , threatens his ex-wife 's new boyfriend , tries to strong-arm the police and school administrators - and all this for what ? Because he was THINKING WITH HIS LITTLE HEAD ! I was really pulling for the father and his gang to beat the stuffing out of the lawyer and drown him in the swamp .. it would have made for a far more satisfying ending .  
0	  I believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies . When I want a sermon , I 'll go to church , but I don't want one from a movie . I don't mind some supernatural themes , ( after all , religion is about as supernatural as you can get ! ) but this movie had so much preaching in it that I was really annoyed . The landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies . The bad guy even looked like he had horns . And what a silly ending : the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men , and that broke the spell . If only life were that simple . I think that when movies are that stupid , they ought to be distributed with a warning : DANGER ! PREACHING CONTAINED HEREIN !  
1	  this was one of the most moving movies i have ever seen . i was about 12 years old when i watched it for the first time and whenever it is on TV i my eyes are glued to it . the acting and plot are amazing . it seems so true to reality and it touches on so many controversial topics . i recommend this movie to anyone interested in a good drama .  
0	  This was a terrible film . There was no story line whatsoever . To top it all off , when they couldn't explain the blood and gore ( the only good part ) .. they threw in a few aliens ! I hate when directors ( or whatever ) run out of ideas and then blame the aliens ! Watch this film if you like . But don't say I didn't warn you . Two things : How could Vinny say " welcome " when he didn't have a tongue ? Its a pity Mr Jones didn't have a bigger role . Second thing that bugged me , why were we shown Vinny Jones ' boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid , then these have no further role . Why not ? I don't like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever . In short . Bad story . I wouldn't waste my time - wish I 'd have watched Mirrors instead .  
0	  " White Noise " had potential to be one of the most talked about movies since " The Exorcist " I think . Seeing as EVP is supposedly true it really had an easy passage to be a feared true fact . Not many movies come along that really instill fear into the minds of people . Like I said this movie could have , but did not . The movie degraded itself to a low class PG-13 scary movie . Nothing compared to " The Ring " or " The Sixth Sense " by any means . Someone really needs to just take charge in the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think , but it makes us jump , scream , everything a horror movie should do . I 'm honestly sick of the PG-13 Horror Genre , because its becoming a genre of its own . We need the old days back , the blood and gore days , the Freddy Kruger , the Jason , The Mike Myers days . Few movies can pull off a think about this mentality being so NOT scary . So why try to pull it off ? A few good jumps in this movie amount to nothing but one of the stupidest endings in movie history with no resolution at all .. don't waste your money on this movie .  
0	  At what point exactly does a good movie go bad ? When does a movie go from " watchable " to " where 's that & ^ @ _ + # ! * OFF switch " ? Thank goodness for DVDs , like this one , that can be borrowed from the library - for free ! Likewise , thank goodness for the " fast forward " switch on the DVD player . I feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box office . At one point ( I 've forgotten exactly when because now it 's all just a blur ) , our " hero , " Luke Wilson starts running through traffic ; I think he was looking for a cab . It was at that point when I gave up , realizing I couldn't care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck . The last time the movie was interesting was when Luke Wilson climbs out of the dumpster , hair dryer in hand , and first meets the " heroine , " Uma Thurman . That scene ended with the purse-snatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far , far above the departing Luke and Uma . That was the last time the movie was funny , and when was that scene ? Ten minutes into the flick ? Every time the movie tried to become " funny , " it couldn't . Every time the movie approached " excitement , " it fizzled out , heading in the opposite direction . When a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard , the sound track stayed empty and silent . The sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame ; the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish . When Uma turns into the crazy ex-girlfriend , I felt like I was watching " The 40 Year Old Virgin Meets Pulp Fiction " ; that 's when I realized that there was no turning back because I thoroughly disliked " The 40 Year Old Virgin " and " Pulp Fiction . " Luke Wilson 's sidekick , Rainn Wilson ( also seen in the dreary " The Last Mimzy " ) adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie . Rainn Wilson , the King of Television Boredom , should stay with that equally awful medium . Hey , Rainn Wilson ! Leave full-length motion pictures alone ! Every time Uma 's rival , Anna Faris , came on screen , I expected Jason or Freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery ; once you see Anna Faris in " Scary Movie , " that 's all you ever see , no matter the movie , no matter the medium . The character played by Wanda Sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick .  
0	  I 've always been a great fan of Woody Allen and always will be for most of what he did in the past , but only a blind lover could ignore how dull , meaningless , pretentious and most of all horrendously acted this movie is . A vacuous mental masturbation based on inconsistent grounds . And what a disastrous idea to artificially recreate a presumed " actor Allen-clone " , that is putting into Will Farrell 's mouth and gestures what Allen would have done in Farrell 's place had he been 30 years younger . The outcome was obviously ludicrous . And not to speak of the dialogues .. what was intended to be philosophical reflections turned into an involuntary mockery of intellectual pondering , unaware of its comic effect . How sad ..  
1	  Buster absolutely shines in this episode , which is the only vehicle I 've seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical ( and silent ! ) comedy that made him famous . It 's still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences - his voice is about the only thing I don't care for , as far as Buster is concerned - but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled . He even repeats some of the gags used in his early two-reelers with Roscoe Arbuckle . My deepest gratitude to Rod Serling for presenting us with this episode , and for giving Buster 's genius full scope . He didn't have much time ( one episode ) to do it in , but this is a touching tribute to Hollywood 's greatest genius .  
0	  AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook , but the director cut out her best scenes . In the scenes that she are in , she is just a zombie . She is involved in a sub-plot that is simular to a sub-plot in " Get Carter " , but she handles the sub-plot better in " Get Carter " . ( I blame the director ) The director 's homage to Hitchcock was corny . ( It 's the scene were Ryan Philippe 's charactor realizes he may not be able to trust Tim Robbin 's charactor , at least I think it 's a homage to Hitchcock . The DVD shows the scenes that were cut out . I think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences .  
1	  This docu-drama is what you would expect from Richard Attenborough , the man who gave us " Gandhi " : beautifully photographed , compellingly casted , well written in the measured , literate manner that Hollywood discarded in the 30 's , and scrupulously accurate . It stands out as a genre film , excelling in its portrayal of native American ( or , more appropriately for its Canadian setting , " First Nations " ) culture and standing with " Black Robe " as a wonderfully photographed piece of Canoe Country and its culture ( here , circa 1934 ) . This idyllic portrait derives drama from its subject : Archie " Grey Owl " Belaney , a Scot raised in Hastings ( England ) by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the " red indian " tales of his childhood that he went to Canada , disappeared into the woods , and became a trapper and adopted son of an Ojibway band . He was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning Indian brides , none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it , for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character . One of his wives ( one smarter than he , by most accounts ) propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the North , and this forms the focus of Attenborough 's tale . The chemistry between Brosnan and Annie Galipeau ( as Grey Owl 's wife Pony ) is engaging and , if not firey , is nonetheless quite touching . A good film when you need some time from the madding crowd .  
1	  I saw this film with a special screening of the work of Owen Alik Shahadah . It is so interesting where did this guy come from . Now he is probably the key independent African filmmaker in the world . And I am not talking about black filmmakers I am talking about filmmakers who are rooted in culture . The idea if anything testifies to the diversity and range of African themes , with his film 500 Years Later it is a African issue . But the Idea doesn't fit that mold . Showing the artistic diversity . The film is an all African cast but the topic is a human topic which most of us could relate to . I just love the mild comedy in it . And the Kora of Tunde Jegede is just amazing , it is really a art-house gem .  
1	  Atlantis : The Lost Empire has some of the best , smoothest animation and cleverly written dialogue of any Disney movie I 've seen . And I was convinced of that in the first 15 minutes . I especially love Don Novello 's voice work on Vincenzo Santorini and Phil Morris as Joshua Strongbear Sweet . Too bad the whole film seems to move at about double the pace that would be appropriate - at least in the first act . One important aspect of any Disney movie is a satisfying antagonist - which Atlantis doesn't provide . He 's average at best . Halfway through the movie there 's a mediocre twist . That 's all . It 's a great movie nevertheless . Everyone should check it out .  
0	  This is the kind of movie i fear the most . Arrogant and Irresponsible , it presents a sketch of the colombian conflict so cliched and dumb it represents an insult to all Colombian people . The performances are godawul , from Grisales ( her naked scene is absolutely pitiful ) , to Bejarano , to Fanny Mickey ( who looks right out of a Tim Burton nightmare ) , to Díaz , who makes a notable effort to bring life to a character so one-dimensional , so cliched and so badly written all he´s left to work with is a mustache . Not to mention the gratuitous ending , a gore fest so cheesy that it would make Ed Wood cringe . It fails in all ways , cinematography , art direction , costumes , makeup , editing , and most of all directing , Jorge Alí Triana has always been a lousy filmmaker but at least his previous movies had some dignity . I can't say anything good about this waste of money , except that i hope Colombian filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty , integrity and responsability from this mean-intended fiasco .  
1	  I managed to catch a late night double feature last night of " Before Sunrise " ( 1995 ) and " Before Sunset " ( 2004 ) , and saw both films in a row , without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately . After sleeping it over , I have to say that I largely prefer the former over the latter , and I shall explain why . Before Sunrise introduces us with then young actors , Ethan Hawke ( Reality Bites , Dead Poets Society ) , only 25 at the time of the film 's release ; and Julie Delpy ( the Three Colors trilogy ) , then 26 ( although looking much younger ) . He is a promiscuous American writer , touring Europe after breaking up with his girlfriend ; She is a young French student , on her way home to Paris . They meet on the Budapest-Vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together . The two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of Vienna , exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love . The film has 1990 's written all over it : back then , technology was leaping rapidly , the new millennium with all it 's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner , and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future . The characters of Jesse ( Hawke ) and Celine ( Delpy ) , with all their flaws and inconsistencies ( Celine 's accent , if by mistake or on purpose , was half American-half French , and it swinged from one spectrum to the other , breaking the character 's credibility ) , were a mirror of the time . Watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement , acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well , is what really made this movie work for me . The fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while . All in all , Sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna , a well told classical romantic rendezvous , and a film I will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future .  
1	  This is a great British film . A cleverly observed script with many quotable lines , which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend . As per usual Phil Daniels is excellent along with that most under rated of British actors Geoff Bell . Peter Bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and Gary Stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece . Although it seems to be billed as a biker movie , i think it will find an audience outside of this , purely on the premise that a lot of people have been there done it and got the t-shirt . also A great original soundtrack with a blinding version of Freebird . This really could be a 21st century heir to the famous Ealing comedies . Like the weed in the Welsh fields : it 's a grower !  
1	  This movie of 370 minutes was aired by the Italian public television during the early seventies . It tells you the myth attributed to Homer of the Journey home of Odysseus after the Troy war . It is an epic story about the ancient Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations , told at list 500 years after those events toke place , around 1100 BC . This is a 1969 movie , so if you buy the DVD version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than Italian , even the close caption is in Italian . Pity . Many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the English subtitles . But if this is not a problem for you , than I would strongly recommend to watch this movie .  
0	  Frank Tashlin 's ' The Home Front ' is one of the more lifeless Private Snafu shorts , a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military . Rather than have Snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster , ' The Home Front ' instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too . Snafu realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy . It 's a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead Tashlin plays the risqué card more heavily , extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief . The result is a well-meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact .  
1	  Absolutely fantastic trash .. this one has it all : nudity , good fight scenes , gore , action , explosions etc . It also stars the wonderful Belinda Mayne as Ingrid - not Olga as the other reviewer pointed out - although Olga turns into Ingrid later on in the film ( you 'll have to watch it to see what I mean ) . I won't bother to go into the story as it 's far too long winded and not very interesting . The relationship between Ingrid and her brother Bo ( Robert Ginty ) is interesting - watch the towel stealing scene to see what I mean . The fight scenes were at once quite good and then spoilt by some really shoddy gore effects that looked like they were done by the team who did City of the Walking Dead ( i.e. strange coloured blood gushing out of neck wounds ) . I 'd advise fans of low budget trash to check it out if they can track down a copy - its pretty rare though and I couldn't ever see anyone bothering to re-release it so it 'll become all the rarer in a few years . Anyway I 'd recommend it solely for Belinda Mayne 's great nude scenes ! That lady 's a fox !  
1	  This film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage . Straight from Lethal Weapon Gary Busey wisecracks , shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it can't help but amuse and entertain . There are tanks , helicopters , machine gun battles , grenades and ice cream vans and if they aren't good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one .. Danny Trejo . And if you don't know who Danny Trejo is then you probably won't like this film .  
0	  It really doesn't matter that Superman comic books are unbelievably naive and their target is ten year old . What matters is that " Superman Returns " is bad movie . In the beginning , a question for You Dear Readers , how many of You actually believe that Superman will be defeated by bald Kevin Spacey ? Anyone ? Just as I thought . No spoilers here . So let 's get to some major issues right now . Firstly , this movie looks like commercial ( scene in the bar with Superman / Clark Kent drinking Budweiser is only scene which looks as it supposed to ) . Imagine commercial of Superman , two and half hour long . Let 's be serious this isn't " Amadeus " or " The Departed " . You actually feel , that this movie is way too long . And special effects are not so special by the way . Secondly , scenario is silly . Sometimes even if something is acceptable in comic , in cinema it looks just stupid . And it 's like that in this case . Of course dialogs are disgrace . I can't believe somebody took money to write them . How many times we will be fed with villain making speeches ? How many times laws of physics will be raped ? ( Jesus , it 's not only the matter of Superman 's strength but also a resistance of materials his dealing with . ) How many times Lois Lane will be fooled by Kent ? How many times Hollywood producers will seek for a story in a trashy comic books ? Since there 's hard to make a good story , why having a weak story for a starter ? It just doesn't work . Guys , get a grip . Try harder , please . Or just stay on this strike forever , who cares . I got the feeling that WGA is permanently on strike . No offense . I 'm not questioning the lame money those people are paid , but the quality of the product they deliver . In this case there is no quality at all . ( At this point You may ask yourself : is it that bad ? Yes it is . ) Thirdly , acting is weak , which is quite a surprise since Bryan Singer ( Usual Suspects ) is directing . Kevin Spacey is having fun , but he 's the only one . Audience is rather not in the mood for jokes . Thing is that comic book hero can be developed into real personality , with clear motivations but also with doubts , fears , some depth . In this case nobody did that job , and characters aren't really interesting . Finally , whole effort of creators turns this movie into parody . Second unit is so bad that attracts attention , since there 's nothing interesting going on on screen anyway . The harder they try ( if they try ) , the funnier it gets ( but it isn't laugh You could expect ) . Final conclusion ? One word : shame . This particular movie , ladies and gents , is camp . Don't waste Your time and don't waste Your money too . Stay home , read a book .  
1	  Superman and the Mole Men is quite possibly Superman 's toughest adventures ever . Lois Lane and Clark Kent are sent to Silsby , home of the world 's deepest oil well . While there , some radioactive mole men come up through the oil well and explore the town . Jeff Corey and many other townspeople try to dispose of the invading mole men . Can Superman change the people 's ways in time to save the mole men ? Can Superman warn the people in time about the radioactive danger the mole men bring ? In my opinion , Superman and the Mole Men is a very intelligent , well-written and well-acted movie . Even though we only get to see Superman fly once briefly , It still makes a great Superman adventure . A must see for anyone . 10/10 Stars  
0	  This was the worst movie I 've ever seen in theaters . It was just a compilation of recycled material . People getting hit in the head is not funny . People getting kicked is not funny . After the third time a guy got kicked in the balls not even the youngest audience member was laughing anymore . It just got tired fast . I went with my younger sister . She actually laughs out loud at King of the Hill but this cinematic masterpiece bored her . I 'm not surprised . The story is pretty lame . A midget thief steals a big diamond in what was definitely the easiest heist in Hollywood history . Then he hides out with a family pretending to be a baby . I know it sounds exciting but that 's the whole story . Say those two lines over and over for 1.5 hours and you 'll get the picture There were predictable jokes galore . I really felt ripped off after seeing this . I wasn't expecting much and I was still disappointed . I wish Keenan would just hire some decent writers to write jokes and / or his next script . This was even worse than White Chicks if that is possible . I 've seen high school plays that were better , and cheaper . There wasn't anything positive about this movie . I don't like my entertainment to be dumbed down .  
0	  Not a movie , but a lip synched collection of performances from acts that were part of the British Invasion , that followed the dynamic entrance of the Beatles to the music world . Some of these acts did not make a big splash on this side of the pond , but a lot of them did . Featured are : Herman 's Hermits , Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas , Peter and Gordon , Honeycombs , Nashville Teens , Animals , and of course , the Beatles . It is so much fun watching these young acts before they honed and polished their acts .  
1	  In New York , when the shy and lonely project manager of a design firm Matt Saunders ( Luke Wilson ) meets Jenny Johnson ( Uma Thurman ) in the subway , he invites her to date and have dinner with him . Jenny immediately falls in love for him , they have sex and she discloses her true identity to him , telling that she is the powerful superhero G-Girl . After meeting his co-worker and friend Hannah Lewis ( Anna Faris ) , the needy Jenny becomes jealous , controlling and manipulative , and Matt follows the advice of his best friend Vaughn Haige ( Rainn Wilson ) and dumps her , breaking her heart . Jenny turns Matt 's life into hell , while he has a romance with Hannah . However , the archenemy of G-Girl and former high school sweetheart of Jenny , Professor Bedlam ( Eddie Izzard ) , proposes Matt to lure Jenny to strip her superpowers . " My Super Ex-Girlfriend " is delightfully silly and funny . This romantic comedy-adventure has many hilarious moments and is very entertaining . Luke Wilson is great in the role of an idiot , Anna Farris is extremely sexy as usual , and Uma Thurman is great in the role of a deranged neurotic superhero that recalls Glenn Close in " Fatal Attraction " or Evelyn Draper in " Play Misty For Me " . My vote is seven . Title ( Brazil ) : " Minha Super Ex-Namorada " ( " My Super Ex-Girlfriend " )  
0	  " Raw Force " is like an ultra-sleazy and perverted version of Love Boat , with additional Kung Fu fights , demented cannibalistic monks , white slaves trade , energetic zombies and a whole lot of lousy acting performances . No wonder this movie was included in the recently released " Grindhouse Experience 20 movie box-set " . It 's got everything exploitation fanatics are looking for , blend in a totally incoherent and seemingly improvised script ! The production values are extremely poor and the technical aspects are pathetic , but the amounts of gratuitous violence & sex can hardly be described . The film opens at a tropically sunny location called Warriors Island , where a troop of sneering monks raise the dead for no apparent reason other than to turn them into Kung Fu fighters . The monks also buy sexy slaves from a sleazy Hitler look-alike businessman , supposedly because the women 's flesh supplies them with the required powers to increase their zombie army . Tourists on a passing cruise ship , among them three martial arts fighters , a female LA cop and a whole bunch of ravishing but dim-witted ladies , are attacked by the Hitler guy 's goons because they were planning an excursion to Warriors Island . Their lifeboat washes ashore the island anyway , and the monks challenge the survivors to a fighting test with their zombies . Okay , how does that sound for a crazy midnight horror movie mess ? It 's not over yet , because " Raw Force " also has piranhas , wild boat orgies , Cameron Mitchell in yet another embarrassing lead role and 70 's exploitation duchess Camille Keaton ( " I spit on your Grave " ) in an utterly insignificant cameo appearance . There 's loads of badly realized gore , including axe massacres and decapitations , hammy jokes and bad taste romance . The trash-value of this movie will literally leave you speechless . The evil monks ' background remains , naturally , unexplained and they don't even become punished for their questionable hobbies . Maybe that 's why the movie stops with " To Be Continued " , instead of with " The End " . The sequel never came , unless it 's so obscure IMDb doesn't even list it .  
0	  Watched on Hulu ( far too many commercials ! ) so it broke the pacing but even still , it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties . Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis . If I were Indian , I 'd protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews . They cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them I usually enjoy Indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment , especially for a modern Indian film . The story doesn't take place in India ( the uncle keeps referring to when Mac will return to India ) but I can't find out where it is supposed to be happening .  
1	  Recently shown on cable tv the movie opens with a disclaimer distancing itself from any co-operation of real life persons ; that in itself is an eye catcher . Yet the script and acting from the main characters is superb and I found myself engrossed throughout . Due in no small way to the crisp , thoughtful and interesting dialogue . The film is about a meeting on one day between two real life musical " legends " who formerly composed together then seperated . The film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies , in a story which proffers an explanation for their initial " split " . What is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they play , faults and all , that this viewer at least was left believing I was witnessing a true event in almost every detail . The great skill of this play is that with astute writing and fine acting a movie basically about " two of us " talking can make an excellent picture . Worthy of at least an 8 out of 10 .  
0	  This film looked interesting ; I 'd read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightly . Started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations . In fact , I didn't bother watching the whole thing .. utter drivel - bad performances , bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters - that was the point of the film , I guess . Watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my weekend . Do not bother with this feature .  
1	  Great , great , great ! That is all I can say about that movie , but imdb want at least four lines of text so I 'll elaborate . The cast was great ( Jerry O'connel is soo cute ! ) , the music was great ( The sixties had the best music ever , imho ) , the historical material was interesting , and so was the way they made the actors of the ' 90s seem like they were actually there in the ' 60s . And most of all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes , and that is the greatness of any drama . BUT IN ONE WORD : GREAT !  
1	  " Men of honor " - true story about a proud and persistent black navy diver ( fabulous Cuba Gooding Jr. ) is definitely a great movie that both touches and entertains and it 's part of the absolute cream of the new millennium cinema . Wonderful acting is the main reason to make this movie something truly special and pretty enjoyable , splendid experience . Charismatic Robert De Niro is marvelous as rough , fierce and pitiless chief Billy Sunday - role is practically written for him . This film alongside with fantastic " 15 minutes " ( 2001 ) are two of the latest proofs that he 's still one of the very finest actors of our time . On the other hand " Men of honor " includes a fine performance from Cuba Gooding Jr. who has been one of the most promising young black actors since " Boyz n the hood " . " Men of honor " goes straight into the company of " Jerry Maguire " , " As good as it gets " and " Instinct " . Cuba Gooding Jr. is a skillful and fantastic actor and I 'm prepared to get lots of more terrific movies from him . " Men of honor " has also quite an excellent story-line and probably the most exciting diving sequences of the movie history . This is a great , fascinating movie and I can only recommend it .  
0	  This is the worst movie ever made . The acting , the script , the location , everything ! I would have given it a little chance if there were attractive women in the movie , but even they were bad . You would think that a movie with the word " beach " in it 's title would have good-looking women in it . Wouldn't you ?  
0	  Well , they say nymphomania leaves you unsatisfied . I don't know if Stella James ( Sean Young ) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac , but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men . She 's still exploring , trying to find " more data " so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it , though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now . ( I can't agree , however , with anyone who says Young is too old for the role . If she is , we should all age so nicely . ) For the most part this film left me cold , though it 's by no means the worst of its type you 'll ever see . And unlike the recent ' Eyes Wide Shut , ' at least something happens in this one .  
0	  When I ordered this from Blockbuster 's website I had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was . Who knows ? Maybe I 'd forgotten to take my ADD meds that day . I do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon , donned in their late 70's-style wide collars , bell-bottoms and feathered hair , I knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster . The first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning , trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe , forcing polyester and porno-quality music on the would-be viewer . From the opening scene with the poorly-done effects to the " monsters " from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of ' The Vagina Monologues ' . Throughout the film , the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear . The " ship " was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old VCR and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path . Of course if moved slower than Bob Barker 's impacted bowels , but it had menacing pencil-thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two ( with some assistance ) . Moving on .. As the weirdness and bell bottoms continue .. We found out that they 're caught in a " Space Time Warp " . How do we garner this little nugget of scientific information ? Because the oldest male lead tells his son that , in a more or less off-the-cuff fashion , like reminiscing about ' how you won the big game ' over a cup of joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing Coca-Cola . Was pops a scientist ? Nope , but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and Einstein 's theories . The recording I watched on DVD was almost bootleg quality . The sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone , other than that , it was really , really , really bad . ( There 's not enough ' really 's ' to describe it , really ) . I know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics . I never saw this film on its original release , but even back then I think I would 've come to the same conclusion : bury this one quick .  
1	  during eddie murphy 's stand up a women from the audience yells at eddie and a man from the audience responds . what is said is , women - DO MR ROB ( this is a character from Saturday night live ) , the man responds with SHUT UP BITCH . unlike the previous post saying the women yelled do gumby , this is incorrect , although the post-er said he was there they must have a hearing problem ! despite what the post-er says about not being able to here it on DVD have a close listen as you actually can hear it on the DVD - DO MR ROB ! i hope this helps anyone curious out the outburst cheers gaz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  
1	  The " Amazing Mr. Williams " stars Melvyn Douglas , who did five films in 1939 , one of which was Ninotchka with Garbo . His co-star was Joan Blondell ( Maxine ) , who ALSO did five films that year , THREE of which they made together ! Douglas is Lt . Williams , and he and his co-horts are presented with a dead body , and they must figure out what really happened . Viewers will recognize his co-workers - the actors ( Clarence Kolb , Donald MacBride , Don Beddoe ) always played positions of authority .. senators , bank presidents , policemen . This who-dunnit has a flair of comedy to it - the policemen are always throwing jabs at each other , and even Williams and his girlfriend are battling verbally . Some fun gags - Williams even takes the man they arrested along on a date with his girlfriend . There 's a lot of fun stuff in here , so get past the slow beginning and wait for the funnier stuff later on . Don't want to give away any spoilers , so you 'll have to catch it on Turner Classic Movies . Director Alexander Hall made mostly comedies , and was reportedly engaged to Lucy at some point .  
1	  When I think of the cheesiest guilty pleasure-type movies , the first thing I think of are ' 80s slasher flicks . Really bad slasher flicks . The formulaic type of film , where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get made . Flash forward to the late ' 90s / early ' 00s . The slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996 's " Scream " . Like in the ' 80s , these films were formulaic , masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as " hip , tongue-in-cheek parodies " of the original slasher flicks . Of this recent blend of " hip parody " neo-slasher flicks , the only one worth seeing is the low-budget , direct-to-video " Cut " . Like most of the other " new " slasher flicks , " Cut " relies on the production of a slasher flick , in this case a fictional 1985 film " Hot Blooded " , to make its commentary on the genre . " Hot Blooded " never finished production , because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film 's killer , Scarman , a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark , pupil-less eyes . Now , 12 years later , a group of film students , whose professor was involved in the production , have decided to go into the vaults , tap the original surviving actress , and finish the film . But every time the film is screened or a scene is shot , " Scarman " returns and someone dies . To quote the tagline , will they finish the film before it finishes them ? This all sounds really bad , and to a degree it is ( really , is there such a thing as a good slasher flick ? ) . There is no character development ( the " new " director is revealed to be the daughter of " Hot Blooded " ' s original director , whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled ; this would 've been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot , yet it 's never mentioned again ) and , like in all other slasher flicks , there are just too many bodies to care about . The actors aren't great , even by direct-to-video standards , but most are having fun with their characters ( and for those who aren't , it 's inadvertent character acting , since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on " Hot Blooded " ) , particularly whoever was lucky enough to play Scarman . " Cut " ' s climax has no big " who dunnit " unmasking of the killer like in the " Scream " films . It doesn't have the gimmick killings of the " Urban Legend " films . What it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a " this way we can write a sequel if it sells well " ending . But that 's par for the course . By any sensible viewing standards , this is a horrible movie that should be avoided , but this " quality " is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre , and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo-slasher flicks .  
1	  The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! One of My favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Husbands Beware ! All appearing in this short are the beautiful Christine McIntyre , Dee Green , Doris Houck , Alyn Lockwood , Johnny Kascier , Nancy Saunders , Lu Leonard , Maxine Gates , and Emil Sitka . Green and McIntyre provide great performances here ! There are so many funny parts here . This is a very hilarious short . There is another similar Three Stooges short like this one called Brideless Groom and I recommend both !  
1	  What I expected : A rather lame overly-stereotypical portrayal of a sports-mad guy and an equally lame stereotypical portrayal of the gal who likes him yet suffers while being second banana to his overly zealous support for his favorite sports team . What I got : An even-handed story where both guy and gal end up admitting - to themselves and each other - that they each have passions in their lives yet each can forgive the other to save the love they share . Sounds sappy but with the nonstop humor and terrific performances this story works ! Barrymore is classic Barrymore : that perfect blend of sweet , strong , and adorable . We expect that from her and she delivered . But Fallon is the nice surprise in this film . He brings to the role the perfect blend of sports nut combined with the appreciation for the normal things in life , like caring about kids and his girlfriend . Fallon delivers his lines with subtle perfection . He can be caring ( " You just ran across the field for me ! " ) and in the same breath be obliviously blinded by his love for the Red Sox ( " How did the grass feel ? Kinda spongy ? " ) at the same time . Fallon 's portrayal " made " the movie . Hopefully , this movie marks the beginning of a better film career for Fallon , something beyond the over-the-top sophomoric humor typical of SNL alums ( i.e. Will Ferrell ) . In short , a movie that could have fallen victim to stereotypical male vs . female characters rose above that limitation and provided nonstop spot-on humorous lines , most delivered with brilliant subtlety by Fallon . Hey , I saw this with my wife - not a baseball fan - and she loved it as much as I did . It 's neither a " Guy Flick " nor a " Chick Flick " . It 's a terrific make-you-laugh flick . Go see it !  
0	  The latest Rumor going around is that Vh1 is starting casting calls for I Love New York 3 mid 2008 . So does this mean Budah or Tailor made dumped New York or does this mean New York dumped the winner ? I know Flavor of Love is coming up to it 's 3rd season , so now with a Flavor of Love 3 and a I love New York 3 .. will there ever be a true winner ? I 've also heard a few rumors that Chance WILL be brought back for the 3rd Season of I Love New York ! I have also heard rumors that New York will be Specially featured on Flavor of Love 3 . Hopefully this was not too much of a spoiler for the ending of I Love New York 2 .. I 'm just stating the latest rumor .  
1	  After seeing ' Break a Leg ' in Vancouver at the release party I thought it was a very enjoyable film . I had a few outright belly laughs and some of the cameos ( Eric Roberts in particular ) were a scream . I haven't heard word about actual release date although I 've heard it 's close . The story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations . The script is smooth and seamless , the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable yet fresh . This film has won at least one award from EACH of the film festivals it 's been in , which is around 10 - 15 or so . I highly recommend ' Break a Leg ' .  
0	  Another of my delves into the bargain bin , this movie gave me exactly what I expected - a load of trashy horror complete with screaming ladies . It all started so well - I liked the little intro with the " newsreel " about the young couple being exposed to a nuclear blast , and was totally absorbed right up until the first person caught fire .. From then onwards the film descended into outright silliness , and at times became almost embarrassing to watch . When the heroine turned out to have been afflicted with the same condition as the main character ( the ability to light one 's own farts without the aid of a match ) it seemed almost as if someone had thrown the idea in at the last moment ( " that 'll be good ! " you can almost hear them say .. ) As for the almost psychic link between the main character and the nuclear power plant , well .. The movie came across as cheap tat - if you pay more than £1.50 for it you 've been done .  
1	  Eddie Izzard is a one in a million comic genius . He goes from squirrels to WWII to Stonehenge to religion to Englebert Humperdink and it 's absolutely hilarious and it all makes sense ! Get a copy of this now , you won't regret it ! I give this an 11 out of 10 .  
0	  I saw this film at SXSW with the director in attendance . Quite a few people walked out , and the audience could barely muster even polite applause at the end . Of the 60 or 70 films I 've seen at this festival , Frownland is among the worst . At 106 minutes , it is at least 95 minutes too long . You get to watch the main character 's failed and drawn out attempts to communicate , in extended real time . The same grimaces , hand over mouth motions , kinetic and frantically repeated words and syllables over and over and over again - WE GET THE POINT . One site actually compares this work to early Mike Leigh . What drugs would you have to be on to make that statement ? Given that Frownland is a Captain Beefheart song , maybe you 'd have to be able to enjoy Trout Mask Replica on heavy rotation to appreciate this film . Unbelievably , this won a jury award at the festival . You can bet it did not win an audience award .  
1	  This is a superb movie , suitable for all but the very youngest , though accessibility for younger people was marred ( at least in the print which I saw ) by the use of some unfortunate choice of English sub-titling ! For much of the film it is almost impossible to guess in which time-period it is set - there is no modern technology shown , not even the ubiquitous Chinese bicycle , just a drab , almost monochrome , everyday life , against which is contrasted the dazzling display of the Sezuan Opera and of celebratory fireworks . Even when a group of soldiers refer to their imminent departure for a theatre of war , this could still be any time in the past 150 years . But then we briefly see a motor car - late 30s , early 40s style - and we realise that we are watching a China on the verge of huge upheavals , and that much of the world we are seeing is about to be swept away in the cataclysm of World War 2 and the Communist revolution . Which makes the central character 's desire to adhere to old customs and traditions all the more poignant . But the film also raises issues which are of vital importance even today , both within China and in other parts of the world : the inequality between boys and girls , men and women ; the trade , for various purposes , in young children ; corruption in society ; injustice ; the importance of friendship . Maybe I 'm reading too much into this film ; but I don't think so ! I also think that it is a scandal that films of this calibre are often not shown in the United Kingdom , whilst dross is passed off as quality material . But don't get me started on that ..  
1	  Telemundo should definitely consider making a DVD collection of the novela Xica ! I know tons of people including myself who would like to be able to purchase the novela Xica ! It is a very entertaining novela which is set in Brazil . The costumes worn by the actors are beautiful and the town in which the novela takes place is beautiful . Xica contains a lot of history of that time period . I wish Telemundo would televise it again even if it was a 2 in the morning . I would highly recommend watching Xica if it is ever shown again on Telemundo . I 've e-mailed Telemundo a million times already to show the novela again but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears . The only cautionary statement about Xica is that it occasionally contains some harsh scenes therefore I would recommend that children under 14 do not watch Xica . Overall Xica merits a 10 out of 10 !  
1	  Excellent plot within a plot within a plot . Shame about two of my film heroes having a good snog . Must be my upbringing :) Very well acted by all . You never quite know who 's going to out-do who . The last little twist at the end allows for all to get their just deserts . Recommend to all . A harmless , tongue in cheek thriller which if it has any faults is probably Michael Caine 's over-use of the word " bloody " , but that 's his signature , isn't it . 9/10  
1	  When I was little , my parents got this movie for me to watch . I really liked it , and I watched it over and over again . Even when I was in 3rd grade I still watched it from time to time . Recently , I watched it again , just for the sake of nostalgia , and though the show was not aimed for my age group ( I 'm in my late teens ) , I still found it entertaining and educational . This show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others . Some parts I found quite entertaining . Also , this show does not have any bad content , so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot . I would recommend this .  
0	  I don't often go out of my way to write comments , but for this I had to , just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy . This doesn't come close . While the premise ( change in colour / gender / whatever ) is bad enough ( and has been done , better , many times before ) the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen . It would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks . However the Wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women . As you will have guessed by now , they fail completely . I have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and make-up people that Hollywood can provide . Its appalling . Add to the mix a basketball player built like a building , terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low . And I like bad movies ! Avoid like the plague .  
0	  Let me put it another way : balls . Or , how about bollo * ks . This is truly awful , more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise . Julia Roberts is a skilled actress , and usually her work is of the highest standard . This movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient . Normally she is the consummate professional , yet I swear that in her eyes , there were signs of bewilderment and despair . The one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director ( Chris Walken ) turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors . Unfortunately , that theme wasn't explored to it 's full potential . Too little , too late . Zeta Jones was wooden , Cusack was Cusack , and Crystal should stick to acting . The two talented ex-Buffy stars had different experiences - Green hopelessly mis-cast , and Balfour under-used . Well done to Julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made .  
1	  I loved this movie . I totally disagree with some ( negative ) critiques that I 've read over the years . This was a great vehicle for Eddie Murphy ! He appeared to have a great time with his part as Chandler Jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say , if he had fun doing it  and most of his audience enjoyed it ! And , it WAS fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with Mr. Murphy 's great comedic style . You have to keep in mind that ' Golden Child ' is a ' fantasy ' film  just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the ' real ' world . During the time this film was released , I was working in a video rental store . This was one of the most popular with all our customers . Every single time , we put this one up on our monitor , ALL the copies we had went out fast with wait-list requests that kept it on the queue for months ! Everyone who rented it loved it ! I was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented  this was one of my favorites and I knew the taste of my customers so I highly recommended this one to most of them . I really feel that this film is a Sleeper  it may not have done too well at the box office  due to very poor marketing  but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later ! ( YES , I did buy this film for my own video library ! ) . I adored the little boy who played the ' Golden Child '  J. L. Reate - but after looking at his profile in IMDb , I noticed that he never did any more films . That is sad , because he definitely had an on-screen aura and could have continued with a film career . I also adored Victor Wong , who played the Old Man ( I LOVED him in his part as ' Egg Shen ' in ' Big Trouble in Little China ' - 1986 ) . At any rate , this was a great film . The only drawbacks that didn't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more ' adult ' in nature  such as ' Chandler 's rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette . It was funny , but it still was out of sync . OK , so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes  those were put in for the mind-set of the day perhaps . This was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from Hollywood . Now that 's Entertainment !  
0	  I wonder how the actors acted in this movie . Annette Bening was really herself , half in and half out , was she faking or being natural ? It didn't make any difference considering that even if she had been walking on the ceiling it would not have changed the pattern of the film . Brian Cox acted really well . I almost thought that he had always acted this way , tricky , dishonest , in a dirty surrounding where nobody really cared about hygiene . As for Gwyneth Paltrow , the question is what she was doing in this film . This film is quite sickening and disgusting . Who would pay to see such a crap ?  
0	  SEX WISH was actually released ( minus ten minutes of more , ahem , ' extreme ' footage ) here in the UK back in the early days of the video boom , and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup when it allegedly inspired a copycat murder case . Strangely enough , the papers brushed this ultra-disturbing flick under the carpet in their headlong rush to get the comparatively innocuous likes of FROZEN SCREAM and NIGHT OF THE DEMON canned , and the film has been all but forgotten as a result . I jumped at the chance to watch it on a DVD-RW and spent most of the film 's duration with my jaw on the floor . It 's not so much politically incorrect as utterly demented , a triple-X take on Michael Winner 's DEATH WISH ( did the title kind of give the game away as far as inspiration was concerned ? ) with hardcore sex and some truly nasty violence thrown into an already bubbling brew of seventies sleaze . If you don't consider yourself to be squeamish , this may force you to think again . By the time SEX WISH is over , you 'll want to scrub your eyeballs clean with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to purge yourself . If any film truly deserves the " it 's only a movie , only a movie , only a movie " tag-line , it 's this one . Highlights ( or lowlights ) - a rapist using a vibrator on a victim as he masturbates over her , Harry Reems 's scene-stealing moustache , the helpless young black couple who are forced to screw in front the sword cane killer ( they 'd have won Oscars for their entirely credible performances if the Academy had gone mad ) before the man is castrated for his troubles , and some jarringly slick direction that threatens to lift the proceedings above their obvious grind-house origins . Don't say I didn't warn you . If you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago , SEX WISH will prove you very , very wrong .  
0	  After just watching FIVE ACROSS THE EYES , I gotta be honest .. I just didn't like it . I had read so many good reviews on this movie , but I just did'nt get where these reviews have came from , I have got a lot of time for newcomers into film-making , and I 'm sure the directors will do well for themselves , but the budget they had was the main problem , there was two cameras used in the entire film ( which was OK ) but they seemed like really cheap cameras . Another problem was the sound , you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time , all talking on top of each other - it 's just impossible to hear what they 're saying . It had a good idea going for it , in a nutshell , they hit a parked car then drive off , a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit , driven by a mad woman , who wants to kill them , and has plenty of chances to do so ! .. and on the other hand the girls have plenty of chances to escape , but don't ! Very frustrating .. I only just scraped through this one !  
0	  Not exactly a new story line , but this romantic comedy makes the concept work . A young man ( John Cusack ) and a drop dead gorgeous woman ( Kate Beckinsale ) keep meeting by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other . Although both are promised to others .. oddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere . A little sappy in some places , but viva la love . Being a romantic I am almost obligated to be riveted . My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling . The finale is almost too sweet , but most deserving . This is not one of Cusack 's deeper roles , but who in the hell could not be smitten by Beckinsale . Notable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon . John Corbett plays the worst role I 've ever seen him in . On the other hand Eugene Levy is quirky and funny . Watch this with your soul mate .  
0	  When I first watched Robotboy , I found it fresh and interesting , but then I noticed , that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself , what is good / bad . Episodes became predictable . And main characters are not interesting . Again we see a hyper-smart boy , beaten by his older brother , parents who don't understand their kid , and his friends : girl and fat boy . Also this show has no logic . A super-modern robot who works on two AA-size batteries , and can use a lot of weapons . But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated modes . We see two different robots , and it declines main idea of the show : " Robot must learn how to behave himself in human society "  
1	  Not so many people like the movies of Bertrand blier simply because they don't understand them . Simply because they are different kinds of people . If you have not been living under a deep desperation intertwined with great personal hope it may be hard for you to enjoy the humor blier shown here . And also the film of blier cannot be classified easily as black-comedy or cult etc . like those of pulp fiction etc . Because there is this delicacy which the audience of north-america frequently fail to appreciate . When I looked at these two ` hooligans ' dining with Jeanne moreau in the seaside restaurant , I felt they were more gentil than any gentleman can have been . The urge to make love wildly like these is the normal reaction we feel under the unbearable pressure of meaningless being-symbolized by the camion suddenly emerges at the Carrefour . SO , les valseuses is much better a name than going places . To dance a valse you need to be elegant , but going places you don't .  
1	  Now I had the pleasure of first viewing Contaminated Man when it premiered on TV back in December of 2000 . An infectious disease expert ( William Hurt ) looses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them . Now some years later he is now in Russia or someplace . I 'm not sure where exactly , all I know is it takes place somewhere in that area . Anyway , because of budget cutbacks at an infectious disease laboratory , they are forced to lay off most of their workers . One of them , a disgruntled security guard named Joseph Muller ( played Peter Weller , best known for his role as the indestructible Robocop ) goes in there and demands that they give him his job back . He needs this job because he is divorced and he needs it to pay child support . So he goes in there , a fight breaks out , and some things get knocked over , dangerous things . It 's soon discovered that Muller has been infected with a deadly pathogen . In fact it 's so deadly , one drop of his blood will kill a person in matter of seconds . Soon word gets out and the disease expert ( Hurt ) is called in to investigate and he later teamed up with an American reporter . Now Muller is determined to get home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing even if he has to infect the entire Russian population . Now as I said before this film is a lot like Falling Down . We have a disturbed person ( Weller here , Michael Douglas in Falling Down ) who will stop at nothing to accomplish there goal even if they have to kill a few people in the process . Next we have a hero-type person ( Hurt here , Robert Duvall in Falling Down ) who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist . Contaminated Man is in fact a very good film with a good story line and some very good performances . 8/10  
0	  It was Jon Pertwee who said " It ` s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly " . Well if that ` s the case PASTY FACES is " Very easy " . David Baker ( As Director / Screenwriter ) and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior Britcoms like LOCK STOCK .. and TRAINSPOTTING , using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly . Alan McCaffrey especially suffers from this type of OTT performance but not enough to ruin the film because there ` s not enough of a film to ruin . PASTY FACES is terrible on all fronts especially scriptwise . I couldn ` t understand why it ended the way it did , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and silly manner . Oh and other glaring errors are that you need a visa to visit the USA and a green card in order to work there - This film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in America without any authorisation - that you still get paid to donate blood in America - People who I know in America , and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop . As far as I know gun laws in America differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter . So we ` ve got a very erroneous view of America from a very unreal and oh so unfunny film . Maybe this is revenge for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood view of the Scots ? Perhaps , but this doesn ` t stop PASTY FACES from being a crap comedy  
0	  This movie was way too slow and predictable . I wish i could say more but i can't . If you enjoy action / adventure films , this is not one to see . I 'd suggest you go see movies like ; Behind Enemy Lines with Owen Wilson and Iron Eagle with Louis Gossett Jr.  
0	  This movie isn't about football at all . It 's about Jesus / GOD ! It 's the same kind of sappy sanctimonious religious drivel you get from those arch idiots who wrestle for Jesus , or pump iron for Jesus . Yeah , Jesus was totally buffed , liked contact sports , and definitely owned a full set of dumb bells . DUHH ! This movie should have been entitled " Hiking for Jesus , " or something along those lines just to let the general public know that the real intent of this movie is to convert people to Christianity , and to pander to those whose brains have already been thoroughly washed in the blood of the lamb . That the title is derived from the Bible is made clear when the head coach is reading his Bible and asking Jesus for help . The recent sports movie " Invincible " was 100 times more inspiring than this was , and Jesus wasn't even a factor . It was just the desire and determination of an individual with a dream . Any broad appeal as an inspirational sports movie is ultimately lost amidst all of the blatant Bible thumping and sanctimonious religious propaganda . One gets the impression that the sole message is the only way you can succeed and make positive gain is if you accept Jesus as your personal savior . But this is simply not true , and is therefore a lie being perpetuated by those who believe that it is true and want everyone else to believe it . The image of the winning athlete thanking Jesus when he wins comes directly to mind . What does he do when he loses ? Does he curse Jesus ? Of course not ! When he loses Jesus isn't responsible . Jesus is only responsible when he wins . And the logic goes round and round and round , and it ends up exactly where the true believer needs it to be , every time ! I had to hit pause when the scene with the coach receiving a brand new truck came on so I could stop rolling on the floor laughing my ass off and catch my breath . Materialism is not what Jesus taught . I find it odd that most so called " Christians " seem to either forget or ignore this message from their " savior , " especially when I see a Jesus fish on the back of a huge gas guzzling SUV that passes me like I 'm standing still . Another message this movie implies is that Jesus apparently cares more about the win loss record of a mediocre high school football team that he does about the millions of starving children in the world . The final scene where the insecure and unsure kicker boots a 51 yard field goal and it is hyped up as an unbelievably incredible miracle puts the final gag me with a spoon religious red flag on this turkey . I only gave it three stars because the guy who played the black coach could actually act .  
0	  Zu Warriors most definitely should 've been an animated series because as a movie it 's like watching an old anime on acid . The movie just starts out of nowhere and people just fly around fighting with metal wings and other stupid weapons until this princess sacrifices herself for her lover on a cloud or something . Whether this princess is a god or an angel is beyond me but soon enough this flying wind bad guy comes in and kills her while the guy with the razor wings fights some other mystical God / Demon / Wizard thing . The plot line is either not there or extremely hard to follow you need to be insanely intelligent to get this movie . The plot soon follows this Chinese mortal who is called upon by this god to fight the evil flying , princess killing bad guy and soon we have a very badly choreographed Uwe Boll like fight scene complete with terrible martial arts on a mountain or something . Even the visuals are weird some might say they are stunning and colorful but i 'm going to say they are blurry and acid trip like ( yes that 's a word ! ) . I watched it both dubbed and with subtitles and both were equally bad and hard to understand .. who am i kidding i didn't understand it at all . It felt like i was watching episode 30 of some 1980 's anime and completely missed how the story began or like i started reading a comic series of 5 at number 4 because i had no clue how this thing started where it was going or how it would end i was lost the entire time . I can honestly say this was one of the worst film experiences ever it was like watching Inu-Yasha at episode 134 drunk .. yeah that 's right you don't know what the hell is going on . Don't waste your brain trying to figure this out .  
0	  Me and a group of friends rent horrible videos to laugh at them , trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs . S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror-but-funny movie we 've rented . The plot is over-done , the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very old . The goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat . And if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life , it 's pathetic . The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot , one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie . The other good aspect is that this movie is so bad at times that you will laugh till you cry . I don't like watching horrible acting or renting these horrible videos , I don't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so bad is hilarious and worth renting . Unless you are too mature to laugh at someone 's downfalls I would recommend it . If your renting / buying it to laugh at it I 'd give it an 8.5 .  
0	  I was required to watch the movie for my work , so I didn't pay for it ( on the contrary , i got paid ) , but I still found the movie to suck far more than average . The jokes were lame , the two lead actresses .. well , to use the " First wives club " division of women 's ages in Hollywood , they are no longer in their " hot chick " age but more in their " district attorney " age . What angered me most about the movie was the main plot line , which pretty much completely plagiarized " Beavis & Butthead Do America " ( in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to " do his wife " , not realizing they 're expected to assassinate her ) . All in all , a bland piece of crap .  
0	  This is indeed a god adaptation of Jane Austen 's novel . Compared with the American Version with Guinneth Paltrow , the script was written to resemble as much as possible the book . But the acting was awful . Besides Kate Beckinsale , who I believe was a true likeness of the Emma in the book , all the other actors were trying too hard . Mark Strong was not the " gentleman " he was supposed to be . He was often rude and offensive , had no feeling whatsoever , and throughout the entire film you could not see his love " growing " for Emma at all . This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale , who seemed to be trying to " resque " her leading role as well as her partner 's . Moreover , there was no chemistry between the entire cast . Hariett Smith , played by Samantha Morton , seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton , played by Dominic Rowan . Therefore , she did not seem as heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book . The settings of the film are also too poor . The costumes are even more so . I would have imagined Emma Woodhouse to dress in a more fashionable and elegant way that she does here . The ending is also too long . It is good that it resembles the book 's ending , but it is a killer ending for a film . And again , I can see no feeling of happiness in the face of Mr. Knightley . To conclude , I believed this adaptation to be loyal to the book , but with poor actors . It seemed as if the film was made without any budget at all . I would prefer to see the " lighter " version with Paltrow and Northam , even if it is clear that it was made to be a " blockbuster " , than to watch these actors ( excepting the good Olivia Williams and the better Kate Beckinsale ) ruin the entire script .  
0	  This wasn't funny in 1972 . It 's not funny now . Unlike a lot of other people , I 'm not bashing the film because it is incredibly sexist - I quote enjoyed that bit , or rather I enjoyed the reaction it generates in annoying PC people - I 'm bashing it because it is poorly written and acted . The only really memorable character is Blakey , which British people 25 years old will recognise immediately since he was a favourite with impressionists for a long time . Avoid .  
1	  I had really only been exposed to Olivier 's dramatic performances , and those were mostly much later films than * Divorce * . In this film , he is disarmed of his pomp and overconfidence by sassy Merle Oberon , and plays the flustered divorce attorney with great charm .  
1	  An absorbing ( although repetitive and rather didactic ) analysis of exploitation and despair in a situation where there is no way forward or up , where the attempts to make yourself feel better by violating and putting down whoever is below you seems to be the only option . But even here , in this desolate wasteland of lost dreams and no future , that does not work , and reaching out to something or someone to comfort and share with , a simple act of charity , gives some reward , even if it just makes the present bearable by reviving memories of the past . Although there is little actual on screen violence , this is a harsh and brutal film about the small mindedness of oppression ( politically and personally ) that does not make for easy entertainment . Clearly based on a play , with a small cast , a broader more expansive relation to the general social and political environment would possibly have helped the film to reach a wider audience .  
1	  Bertrand Blier is indeed l'enfant terrible of French cinema and in the seventies he always could shock the public . Filmed with his fave duo ( Depardieu and Dewaere ) and the usual dose of sex ( Miou-Miou plays her typical role , at least the one from the seventies as little could we know that a decade later she would be the best French actress ever ) . In first " Les Valseuses " is also one of the first roadmovies as the viewer is just taken to some journeys of two little criminals . Those who only are satisfied with family life , or simply know nothing more , the movie would be quite a shocker but this movie is more than just that , it just let you think of all the usual things in life ( working for the car , being bounded at work etc . ) . It 's a sort of critic towards the hypocrite society we 're living in . Great job and it just makes you wish two things : Dewaere died just too young as he was a topactor and of course Depardieu , he 'd better should have stuck with French movies as he proves here that no one can beat him . Timeless classic and 20 years later it will still shock some ..  
0	  I saw this trailer and thought to myself my god is this movie for real , who would want to see this movie and at the same time i thought that , my girl friend turned to me and said " we have to go see this movie " .. enough said so i saw this about 5 minutes go and I tried to put on a brave face and enjoy the cheap scares but there weren't even any of those . It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen the director has no influence no perspective the same shots were used again and again he did not build up suspense the cast probably were simply told scream cry run fall . I would love to see the script as the first 40 mins was mostly annoying girly giggles and bad music , there was absolutely no character development . The plot is just .. well there was no plot it was basically I know we will terrorize a high school group on their prom night with a stalker serial killer , That 's brilliant ! hmm The acting was what you expect in a Australian soap opera hopeless , that main character the Blondie god dam she annoyed me . her longest line must have been half a sentence , and every time she was on camera she was just pulling another rude facial expression . Please listen to me if you have any taste in movies don't go see this , and if your like me and don't have a choice well then I wish you good luck , maybe smuggle in an ipod or magazine . Can't believe this film got made !  
0	  My girlfriend once brought around The Zombie Chronicles for us to watch as a joke . Little did we realize the joke was on her for paying £1 for it . While watching this film I started to come up with things I would rather be doing than watching The Zombie Chronicles . These included : 1 ) Drinking bleach 2 ) Rubbing sand in my eyes 3 ) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4 ) Re-enacting the American civil war 5 ) Tax returns 6 ) GCSE Maths 7 ) Sex with an old lady . Garrett Clancy , aka Sgt . Ben Draper wrote this ? The guy couldn't even dig a hole properly . The best ting he did was kick a door down ( the best part of the film ) . This was the worst film I have ever seen , and I 've seen White Noise : The Light . Never has a film had so many mistakes in it . My girlfriend left it here , so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap . News just in : Owen Wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself . Fact . DO NOT WATCH  
0	  What can I say ? I think I have to write " Spoiler alert " and then " reveal " they used the F-word a LOT in this movie - like in every two sentences . I did not like this movie at all - too much hints on sexual perversions , sidesteps and cheating . And that swearing was totally out the window . I gave this movie " 3 " and two of those points are for Mira Sorvino 's sexy movements on the dance floor .  
0	  I usually check out the MTV movie awards to watch a witty , entertaining show that delivers a unique award show ( Chewbacca winning a life-time achievement award as example ) . So this year was no different . While I 'm not a fan of Justin Timberlake , Seann William Scott has always been funny-albiet stupid-to me . I 've laughed at Stiffler in both American Pie movies , and even enjoyed him in Dude Where 's My Car ? . But the MTV movie awards were simply horrible . Nothing was coherrent , humorous , or entertaining . Justin Timberlake should stick to singing and dancing ; he sure as hell can't act . I 'm curious as to who the writers were for this show . Last year 's performance by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar was extremly funny ( The Lord of the Rings parody alone was worth watching the entire show ) , but this year was completly different . Did anyone understand Timberlake 's comments regarding Luke Wilson and Kate Hudson ( " They 're staring in a movie together , but have never met ! Here they are .. " ) Where was the joke ? Kate and Luke just went into their lame dialogue , never making a reference to the " joke " by Timberlake . And Seann was completly wasted as a talent , not even causing me to smile , yet alone laugh . And what was the point of Harrison Ford 's one-liners ? Did they make ANY sense to anyone ? Perhaps the MTV writers figured the young viewers would only know the aging Ford as Han Solo , Indiania Jones , or the President from Air Force One . I 'm baffled . And would someone tell me the deal with Adrian Brody ? How old is this guy and how old does he THINK he is ? The guy looks 30 , trying to act 19 again .. give it up , show some class ( like in your best actor academy award speech ) and act your age ! I give this show 1 star out of 4 , simply because of the speech by Gollam for Best Visual Performance . This was very creative , extremely well done , and caused the only genuine laugh of the entire evening .  
0	  Forest of the Damned starts out as five young friends , brother & sister Emilio ( Richard Cambridge ) & Ally ( Sophie Holland ) along with Judd ( Daniel Maclagan ) , Molly ( Nicole Petty ) & Andrew ( David Hood ) , set off on a week long holiday ' in the middle of nowhere ' , their words not mine . Anyway , before they know it they 're deep in a forest & Emilio clumsily runs over a woman ( Frances Da Costa ) , along with a badly injured person to add to their problems the van they 're travelling in won't start & they can't get any signals on their mobile phones . They need to find help quickly so Molly & Judd wander off in the hope of finding a house , as time goes by & darkness begins to fall it becomes clear that they are not alone & that there is something nasty lurking in the woods .. This English production was written & directed by Johannes Roberts & having looked over several other comments & reviews both here on the IMDb & across the internet Forest of the Damned seems to divide opinion with some liking it & other 's not , personally it didn't do much for at all . The script is credited on screen to Roberts but here on the IMDb it lists Joseph London with ' additional screenplay material ' whatever that means , the film is your basic backwoods slasher type thing like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 1974 ) with your basic stranded faceless teenage victims being bumped off but uses the interesting concept of fallen angels who roam the forest & kill people for reason that are never explained to any great deal of satisfaction . Then there 's Stephen , played by the ever fantastic Tom Savini , who is never given any sort of justification for what he does . Is he there to get victims for the angels ? If so why did he kill Andrew by bashing his head in ? The story is very loose , it never felt like a proper film . The character 's are poor , the dialogue not much better & the lack of any significant story makes it hard to get into it or care about anything that 's going on . Having said that it moves along at a reasonable pace & there are a couple of decent scenes here . Director Johannes doesn't do anything special , it 's not a particularly stylish or flash film to look at . There 's a few decent horror scenes & the Tom Savini character is great whenever he 's on screen ( although why didn't he hear Judd breaking the door down with an axe while escaping with Molly ? ) & it 's a shame when he gets killed off . There are a couple of decent gore scenes here , someone has their head bashed in , there 's a decapitation , someone gets shotgun blasted , someone throat is bitten out , someones lips are bitten off & someone is ripped in half . There is also a fair amount of full frontal female nudity , not that it helps much . Technically Forest of the Damned is OK , it 's reasonably well made but nothing overly special or eye-catching . This was shot in England & Wales & it 's quite odd to see an English setting for a very American themed backwards horror . The acting is generally pretty poor save for Savini who deserves to be in better than this . Horror author Shaun Hutson has an embarrassing cameo at the end & proves he should stick to writing rather than acting . Forest of the Damned was a pretty poor horror film , it seems to have fans out there so maybe I 'm missing something but it 's not a film I have much fondness for . Apart from one or two decent moments there 's not much here to recommend .  
0	  I have seen many a horror flick in my time , all of them absurdly bad , but none reach the depths that this piece of trash lowers itself to . This movie made me angrier and angrier as I watched it as I tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about . Now , after I 've seen it , I understand - sort of - what was going on and why , but the movie itself is just too confusing to be enjoyable when you 're watching it . Yes , there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence , one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters ( " The highway belongs to me .. ME ! " ) , and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the " plot " , but still you 'll leave this movie feeling alone and taken advantage of , like a puppy who isn't wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road . Blech .  
0	  Ever wonder why Pacific Islanders seem to automatically assume the sense of humour of Black Americans ? regardless of their ethnic origins ? Well this film will not provide any answers to this often pondered question - but it will provide an excellent case study . From its onset this film acts as a sort of " Old School " for Pacific Island New Zealanders , which immediately raises the question what exactly is the point of such a task . Is it meant to perpetuate ingrained stereotypes of Pacific Island New Zealanders ? or is it intended to exploit this potential market ? The story is weak , jokes humorless , and the ending is expected . This film has done nothing for New Zealand cinema , as it is merely an appropriated romantic comedy that is devoid of any merit .  
0	  Jewish newspaper reporter Justin Timberlake ( as Joshua " Josh " Pollack ) is puzzled when a courtroom defendant whispers " Thank you " to testifying officer LL Cool J ( as Rafe Deed ) as he leaves the witness stand . In the opening sequences of this film , you are given the explanation . You will see Mr. Cool J 's devilish detective partner Dylan McDermott ( as Frances " Laz " Lazerov ) decide NOT to murder Damien Dante Wayans ( as Isaiah Charles ) . The cops in the city of " Edison " are so corrupt they shoot their suspects , steal their money , and snort their dope . Whether he 's out to impress his girlfriend ( herein , called " Pussy " ) or win a Pulitzer , the city 's corruption does NOT sit well with the noble Mr. Timberlake . Timberlake decides to investigate the corruption , which reaches both unexpected scope and life-threatening levels of danger . Writer / director David J. Burke keeps the film above water , but just barely . LL Cool J beats Timberlake in the " pop star to movie star " sweepstakes ( aka the " rapper to actor " progression ) . Mr. McDermott has fun with his role . Lending gravitas to the proceedings are sagely supporting actors Morgan Freeman ( as Moses Ashford ) and Kevin Spacey ( as Levon Wallace ) . F.R.A.T. means First Response Assault and Tactical , but it 's more important to know that " Edison ( Force ) " stars Justin Timberlake and LL Cool J , not Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey ( who seems lost ) . * Edison ( 9/17/05 ) David J. Burke ~ Justin Timberlake , LL Cool J , Morgan Freeman , Dylan McDermott  
0	  This film is not even worth walking to the movie theatre . No jokes , but stupid and boring laughing on repeated disgusting stuff . The music and the girls are great , unfortunately you have to watch the whole movie to enjoy them . It was weak , very very weak .  
0	  I saw the movie last night and I really wanted to like it . My expectations for the movie had been going up and down ever since I heard it was being made . Some days I 'd see something spectacular and some days I 'd be disappointed . Yet being the kind of fan I am , I had high hopes for this movie but in the end I was sorely disappointed . While I love the Richard Donner movies I didn't like their sometimes campy nature or the changes they made to Superman 's character and his powers . Singer however chose to take the worst elements of the Donner movies and put them in his version . While his Lex Luthor is slightly darker he 's still nothing more than a shyster , a conman and a common criminal . He 's no more intelligent than when Gene Hackman played him . Kevin Spacey does his best to play Luthor well but ultimately he falls victim to shoddy writing and unremarkable dialog . His henchmen are more two dimensional than even comic book henchmen . Most of them literally have no dialog in the movie . * SPOILERS AHEAD * Kitty Kowalski is almost exactly the same character as Ms . Tesmacher . She seems to be as evil and cold as Lex Luthor but she proves to be just an underling who melts after seeing Superman in trouble and quite predictably betrays Luthor . The biggest disappointment in the movie was Frank Langella as Perry White . I wasn't a huge fan of the over the top Perry White in the Donner movies but at least he had a soul . He was after all said and done , a veteran reporter who cared about the truth and a good story . Langella 's Perry White is nothing but a corporate stooge . He wants everyone to concentrate on the Superman related stories because they sell papers even though every other paper is doing the same thing . He doesn't care about the real stories , the real mysteries like the black out and what Lex Luthor is up to now that he 's out of prison . The worst thing about Langella is that he 's DULL ! Some actors can be quiet and sober and yet have an undercurrent that lets you know that still waters run deep . Frank Langella is puddle . Brandon Routh is not a bad actor . He 's OK but again there is not a single memorable line in the whole movie . Not the actor 's fault . His movements are clearly meant to look graceful , like even the slightest movement of his fingers effects the way he flies . But it still looks choreographed and artificial . Lois Lane while badly written was surprisingly well acted by Kate Bosworth . Unfortunately , again , for a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and writer , she is about as eloquent as any teenage on Dawson 's Creek . James Marsden was my favorite actor in the whole movie , mostly because he looks more like Superman than even Routh . Without any superpowers he manages to figure out Lois Lane 's message , flies a plane to the location , gets on board Luthor 's yacht and rescues Lois and her son . The only moving moment in the movie is when they are all trapped pantry as it is flooding with water and the ship is sinking . You see them slowly going being immersed in the water . You know Superman 's going to come by at the last moment to rescue them but still you can't help but feel sorry for them . As I said before the plot is very haphazard . Unlike Singer has said , this is not a movie about a superhero returning and trying to find his place in the world . As soon as he returns the world welcomes him back with open arms . Lois is the only one who 's not happy to see him back . Even Luthor is happy to have Superman back because it gives him a chance to settle the score with the man of steel . Superman is shown to be probably one of the dumbest heroes in the universe . A big green piece of meteorite is stolen from a museum , Lex Luthor is out of prison , he now has knowledge about Superman 's powers and weaknesses , and yet he 's still not able to connect the dots enough to know Luthor would be using kryptonite against him . According to the movie the only thing Superman is good for is lifting really , really heavy things . The action sequences are all incredibly predictable .  
0	  They probably should have called this movie The Map because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery . Not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are . The only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that is constantly building up on the forehead of our main character . This of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the Immortal Hills Cemetery . Come on now , couldn't they have shown us just one of the death scenes ? We hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we don't get to see anything . Some how I Bury The Living manged to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone . Unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat i recommend renting a better I movie , such as I Spit On Your Grave or I Drink Your Blood .  
1	  I just viewed this great good-natured parody of Night of the Living Dead , and I have to say it was so awful and so corny it was excellent . This movie incorporated all the antics and scenery shots that the original had including the cemetery , the supposable abandoned house , the basement and the front lawn . What I especially love about this movie is the comical use of bread and all the common household enemies bread has a grudge against . C'mon , we know that toasters , toaster ovens and zip-locks have done bread in a dozen times and now we must call for their help in order to defeat the reanimated bread . Aside from the cheap acting and voice-overs , this short horror film is my personal favorite parody of Night of the Living Dead , even better than Night of the Living Dead of 1990 . I think what makes this movie worth watching is how the writers and directors utilized all the dialogue from the original movie and revolved it around bread , including how the bread became reanimated and to avoid leftovers because they are especially dangerous . Another great reason why I love this movie is that , there is no exception as to what bread is evil , bagels are evil and even communions are evil , which is demonstrated by a hilarious scene involving a newscaster and a rather monotone priest . I think that the actors are especially humorous performing the deed of being viscously attacked by slices of bread ( i.e. the car scene ) . I think the end is very worth sticking around . Even though this is a short and that " Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil , Mutant , Alien , Flesh Eating , Hellbound , Zombified Living Dead Part 2 : In Shocking 2-D " is debatably another great parody , it 's still recommend as a great horror parody done by , what seems to be college filmmakers . I highly recommend this movie to anybody who is able to make fun of Night of the Living Dead and still have respect for the filmmakers . I would also like to recommend this movie to anybody who loves D-movies and horror parody 's , it 's just a wonderful little short horror film that 's fun to watch and learn .  
0	  Lillian Hellman 's play , adapted by Dashiell Hammett with help from Hellman , becomes a curious project to come out of gritty Warner Bros . Paul Lukas , reprising his Broadway role and winning the Best Actor Oscar , plays an anti-Nazi German underground leader fighting the Fascists , dragging his American wife and three children all over Europe before finding refuge in the States ( via the Mexico border ) . They settle in Washington with the wife 's wealthy mother and brother , though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the German Embassy playing poker . It seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus , and when we realize what the heart of the material is ( the wise , honest , direct refugees teaching the clueless , head in the sand Americans how the world has suddenly changed ) , it seems a little patronizing-the viewer is quite literally put in the relatives ' place , being lectured to . Lukas has several speeches in the third-act which undoubtedly won him the Academy Award , yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit , enter and exit . As his spouse , Bette Davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage , but the role doesn't allow her much color . Their children ( all with divergent accents ! ) are alternately humorous and annoying , and Geraldine Fitzgerald has a nothing role as a put-upon wife ( and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong ) . The intent here was to tastefully , tactfully show us just because a ( WWII-era ) man may be German , that doesn't make him a Nazi sympathizer . We get that in the first few minutes ; the rest of this tasteful , tactful movie is made up of exposition , defensive confrontation and , ultimately , compassion . It should be a heady mix , but instead it 's rather dry-eyed and inert . * from *  
0	  A mummy narrates vignettes about men , women , and the sex between them . Huh ? At the beginning , the mummy randomly asks the viewer , " Imagine having sex with this girl . Imagine having sex with this boy " about 37 times , while flashing pictures of half naked mod youths . Later , said mods boys pelt mod girls with .. vegetables ? If you ignore ( or fast forward ) through the mummy 's rambling , the shorts aren't bad in their own right . I found a few of them rather funny . My personal favorite is one where the sexually-confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed . This is one , well , bizarre movie .  
1	  I first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didn't really think it was anything particularly special . AS time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film , which i will come to later . For a while i left this film alone and didn't watch it for a while . When looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago ( now being 15 ) , I dug out the VHS of homeward bound . After watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldn't really explain . The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never really expect . The films nature of three completely different animals collaborating together to find their way home really sends a message home that no matter how different you are you can always find common ground , something that you all need . The way the personalities of the characters is chosen is truly fantastic . In that you have an old knowledgeable wise golden retriever , looking after or guiding ' chance ' the fun loving if slightly clumsy young American bulldog , with sassy the clever , vulnerable but confident cat . The film follows these three friends or companions on a journey that is so realistically impossible it creates magic in that you start to believe that this journey can happen . I don't want to sound like a soft tissue grabber when it comes to films i assure you i am quite the opposite , but the most uplifting part of this film is without a doubt shadows return , when shadow desperately tries to escape and chance and sassy , painfully are told by him to leave . When both animals return to their beloved owners there is a silence until shadow limps over the horizon to the awe of all . There is a fine line between heartwarming and corny rubbish but this film is pure magic even at the age of 15 . This film may not be Lord of the rings but for Disney to produce such a fantastic film using animals and for it to uplift myself in the way it does even at this age it deserves 10/10 .  
1	  I rented the film ( I don't think it got a theatrical release here ) out expecting the worse . The previews made the film look awful . I was in fact very surprised , it was well worth watching ; it was loosely scripted , almost like an ensemble piece of film . It had some very funny moments in it and although flawed is an effective satire on the show and the people on the show without being too scathing . It is flawed , mainly by the awful soundtrack of bludgeoning ' comedy ' effects but on the whole it comes across as honest and generally true to form of the show in an altmanesque or Larry Sanders way . At the moment it is the fashion to be critical of Jerry Springer , he is also an easy target . Springer could have made Citizen Kane and it would be proclaimed ' the worst film ever made ' . I recommend this film for anybody interested in the show . A flawed but innovative and interesting piece of film .  
1	  Revenge is the theme of this Denzel Washington thriller that offers its share of action , mayhem , murder and grisly bloodletting . The essentials are a bodyguard 's search and destroy mission as his charge , young Dakota Fanning , is kidnapped from school , which is exactly what Washington was hired to prevent . The Mexico City locations are as chaotic as the storyline moves towards its predictable , violent conclusion , with plot twists along the way . Washington , a former CIA operative with a drinking problem , gets a good reference from a former fellow agent which sets in motion the plot 's outline . Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry between them and after a troublesome beginning , the bodyguard and his charge become the best of friends . Christopher Walken , Rachel Ticotin , Radha Mitchell , Giancarlo Giannini and Mickey Rourke comprise the good cast in support of the two stars .  
1	  Gregory Peck gives a brilliant performance in this film . The last 15 minutes ( or thereabouts ) are great and Peck is an absolute joy to watch . The same cannot however be said for the rest of the film . It 's not awful and I 'm sure it was made with good intentions , but the only real reason ( if I were to be honest ) to see it is Peck . For the rest you are better off just reading the Old Testament .  
1	  First , I 'll give my rating for the series overall ; * 7 out of ten stars . I 've taken away three for the downhill slide this series suffered after John Amos departed . Don't get me wrong there were hard hitting episodes later but only after Esther Rolle left for a season and returned . In February of 1974 , a really great sit-com ( with dramatic overtones ) premiered on CBS . It was a TV first , a show about an African-American family living in the Chicago Projects in the 1970s . Created by Norman Lear as a spin-off of " Maude " , he once again struck the right chord with viewers . Not since this show have I seen a situation comedy directly talk about the struggles of inner-city families . ( Well , there was Fox 's " South Central " in ' 94 but was not renewed . ) John Amos as James Evans Sr. was the ultimate father figure for this family and acted as any father should to keep his family together and his kids from going down the wrong paths in life . Esther Rolle was a wonderful no non-sense mother figure who was on the same page as her husband when it came to their kids upbringing . Ralph Carter as Michael a young but very bright young man for his age but stuck in a school system that doesn't meet his academic needs . His character 's name is the same as the show 's founder Mike Evans who was Lionel Jefferson on " The Jeffersons " . ( Mike Evans passed away Dec . 2006 ) . Thelma is a young girl of 16 or 17 and has to deal with the dangers of being a young woman in the streets of the ghetto . Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is the typical young wise-cracking , jiving kind of young man who does not take life seriously enough . Simply put , all my favorite episodes are with John Amos , with the exception of the Penny Gordon / Janet Jackson story lines . After the demise of the James Evans character , the show lost it 's stability and viewers departed . Esther Rolle left for an entire year , not wanting to play second fiddle to JJ 's smart-aleck " Dyno-mite 's " ! She returned the next season , after securing a guarantee that the writer 's would even things out . Florida 's neighbor Wilona Woods was a divorced woman who ended up adopting an abused little girl Penny Gordon ( played by a then 10 year old Janet Jackson ) . Penny 's abusive mother was played by Totie Fields , Kim Fields ' Mother . In August of 1979 the show came to an end , with all leaving the projects for a better life . JJ the artist had sold an idea to a comic-book company , Michael went off to live on campus at college . Wilona & Penny , Thelma & football player husband Keith + Florida all moved into the same building in uptown Chicago . Not the most realistic ending but by that time it didn't matter .  
1	  I had never heard of this film before a couple of weeks ago , but its concept interested me when I heard it : an American man meets a European woman on his last night in Europe and they spend the night together talking . It sparked my interest , but I never expected it to be this great . Before Sunrise is a masterpiece , and it 's also one of the most romantic films on record . To my surprise , it completely lacked the cynicism of the 1990s . It 's impossible to really talk too much about it , since there is no real plot , so to speak ( although there are plenty of thoroughly interesting things you could talk about ; it is sort of like My Dinner With Andre , where there is a conversation , but it 's not JUST the conversation that matters ) , but let me just say , see it . SEE IT !  
0	  A friend of mine lent this video to me and I was fairly excited to watch it , but after ten minutes of James Hetfield 's slow pitched vocals and Lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion I began to think , ` Why am I watching this ? ' That question will be coursing through your minds in 5  10 minutes after you hit Play . I gave the tape back the same day , as you would suspect , not worth buying or watching ! Just my opinion !  
1	  It was considered to be the " Swiss answer to the Lord of the Rings " , but it is much more than that . It isn't an answer to anything , it 's in itself something new , something funny and sometimes it 's downright stupid and silly - but was Monty Python any different than silly ? The beginning immediately makes the statement that this film is low budget and not meant to be taken entirely seriously . Cardboard clouds on strings knock into the airplane in which the main character is seated . But , to compensate the missing special effects , the landscape does the trick . It is absolutely beautiful and stunning - who needs New Zealand , Switzerland has it all . What I liked about the film was the simple approach and the obvious passion and energy that went into it . It isn't brilliant ; yet it 's got some good humorous parts . Edward Piccin as Friedo is absolutely convincing , it would be enough to go and see the film because of him ! There are some good jokes , some of them are very lame , some of them won't be understood by people outside of Switzerland . I liked the idea of having " Urucows " instead of Uruk Hai ; I loved the scene where Friedo decides to take " Pupsi " , a telehobbie , with him on the journey . Also very funny is the scene when Rackaroll , the sword-fighting knight , decides to show off with his sword - and subsequently smashes it into a wall , breaking it . And there is this one scene where the " nazgul-ish " characters do a wonderfully comic scene that includes a toilet brush .. I didn't approve of the idea of the Ring being used by Schleimli , the " Gollum " character , in order to " seduce " the ladies . That was a bit far fetched . The idea of Lord Sauraus wanting to cover the lands with fondue wasn't that brilliant either . Original , certainly , but not brilliant . But most of all did I dislike the idea of a gay dragon , that really wasn't necessary . All in all I recommend to see the film simply because it is so crazy and totally trashy . Don't expect a LotR parody like " Spaceballs " was for Star Wars . But if you go to the flicks thinking that this is going to be an amusing evening out , with absolutely no ambitions , then you 'll enjoy . I am not sure if it works in other languages , because it does live from the Swiss dialects as well as from the jokes and actors . All in all : hat off to the courage of the Swiss crew who did that !  
1	  Jim Henson 's Muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood . This film makes me feel like a kid again . Okay , the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends . The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City . You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch . Anyway , the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the Muppets Gang . The problem with the show is Kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in New York City . It 's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself .  
1	  This film is a stunning piece that will convince even the most skeptical viewer that Gerard Depardieu is one of the finest film actors of the last 50 years . His performance shocks , entertains , disgusts and charms you while leaving you breathless . This film was shot in the very early days of his film career and is very raw , but still is able to convey the mastery of Depardieu . A must-see for any Depardieu fan and by far his best early work .  
0	  Before I begin , I want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved , including Whittaker , who indeed deserves his nomination . It is highly entertaining , and . . . taken in the right context as a work of FICTION , it is a very good movie . For that , I give it the two stars . However , rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere , I want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth . I stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character , Dr. Nicholas Garrigan , is a complete invention of fiction . Rather , it presents this character into a real historical setting , and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real , and what they are seeing is the truth . I have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction - but to do so in such a dishonest matter is , in a word , reprehensible . There can be no doubt that Africa , along with most Third World Countries is rife with human misery and suffering . Hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film . But Hollywood also has its eye toward making money . The only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the West is to either experience it for yourself , or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary . But these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much . At the end of the day , they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself , and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming , " SEE , WE TOLD YOU IT WAS BAD ! " The seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the DVD after sitting through the movie . Arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of Kay Amin , Idi 's second wife , whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity . In the film , we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse ( arms for legs and vice-versa ) . This is the director making sure you understand that Amin is , as the Gungans say , Bom-bad ! But watching the documentary , we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth , which the sitting Minister of Health at the time himself tells us is not true . So . . . what . . . they just MAKE UP these things ? Why ? Because Hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence , that 's why ! They don't trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves . Look , that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that Amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media - we don't need this Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE inspired imagery to reinforce that ! And this is just the tip of the iceberg . What is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character Garrigan is himself fictional . There was no young Scottish doctor taken under Amin 's wing . As such , Garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb Westerners understand the African world . The producers seem to thing we won't be interested in a film about Africa unless there is a white face in it . ( Ironically , even the titular character is portrayed by an American black actor ! ) The problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of Amin and his regime , but instead an exploitative thriller about a white Westerner coming to Africa for all the wrong reasons , making several horrible mistakes , and then " redeeming " himself , even at the cost of three other innocent lives . Honestly , I have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of Mrs. Amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional Scottish doctor - it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment ! I really wish Hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money . I first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative A BEAUTIFUL MIND , Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman 's sugary-sweet adaptation of the life of John Nash , which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that America just can't get enough of . The sad truth is that Hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years , and viewers , who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves , buy these fake portraits hook , line , and sinker . Look , I 'm certainly not suggesting Amin is being turned into a villain he wasn't . My point is , with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man , why must Hollywood then go to such fictional lengths ? Why must Hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films ? Why can they not trust us to think for ourselves ! ? Can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves ? I urge all who continue to watch Hollywood 's purportedly " true " movies to do yourself the favor of ALWAYS investigating for yourself , and to NEVER assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth !  
1	  Jörg Buttgereit goes a bit too far with his movies and themes at times , even for my taste but his movies are always something special and hard to classify . They are artistically made , with also often deeper meaning to its themes . This movie is a perfect example of his work . It 's also really hard to label this movie . It 's not really a movie with a story to it , in a sense of having a beginning , middle and end in it . It also doesn't have a main character but instead focuses on 7 different suicides and killings , on 7 different days . All different stories are being told with lots of class , though some of them are of course more ' interesting ' and realistic than the others . They are not necessarily connected but yet together they still tell a story . The movie doesn't feel disjointed at all . All different stories have a different feel to it and Buttgereit tells the story without hardly using any words ( also typical for his style ) but instead lets the images and obvious sensible emotions of the characters tell the entire story . It helps to make this movie an effective one to watch . Again , the production values all aren't too high and this might be something that might scare off some people . It however helps for this particular movie to set the right tone and atmosphere for the entire movie and its dark , disturbing and depressing themes . A Buttgereit movie that I ' enjoyed ' watching . 7/10  
1	  A good film with-for its time-an intense , sprawling , rather dark story somewhat reminiscent of John Ford 's " The Searchers " though not so brutal . The story starts fast and doesn't let up , with several scenes of really good dialog between ( Stewart 's ) Jeff Webster , Ronda Castle and Sheriff Gannon . This film is in some ways reminiscent of " Bend of the River " ( 1952 ) , also a Mann-Stewart work , but I found it far less sentimental and more interesting . There are a few caveats : a too-quickly wrapped up ( and rather sentimental ) ending ; 24-year-old Corrine Calvert is not very convincing as a naive French teenager , and of course the film takes place in the Mythic West , a land of fable where the real laws of nations and physics don't apply . But these are trivial concerns . James Stewart is surprisingly good as a dark , disengaged man who thinks he cares for no one but himself , and the mountain scenery can't be beat . A fine Western costume drama .  
1	  This could be a 10 if it wasn't for the quite predictable and hollywood-ish scenario . Daniel Day-Lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time ( why not THE leading may I ask ) and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level . I personally was impressed with Hugh O ' Connor who played Christy Brown as a child . The very first scene I watched him was really strong . Wow .  
1	  The question of whether or not one likes this film version of " The Ghost Train " invariably depends on one thing and one thing alone : your reaction to the performance of Arthur Askey . He tends to steal almost every scene he 's in , and not always in a good way . Sometimes you wish he 'd settle down or back off just a little , to allow the plot 's many characters to feature and develop ( which they do to some extent ) . But somehow everything keeps pointing back to Askey 's Tommy Gander character . Personally I like the film , and even like Askey to an extent . I always seem to plonk it into the vcr at those odd hours of the early morning when I can't sleep and really can't find the energy to watch anything else . There is something about watching old b / w movies in the quiet dark of pre-dawn that I find appealing ..  
1	  Just when it was easy to assume that a costume drama about royalty couldn't go anywhere , we are given a treat , a moving and intelligent drama anchored by strong and charismatic performances by Emily Blunt , a marvel in the leading role , Paul Bettany , Rupert Friend , Miranda Richardson , and Mark Strong , as the immediate forces that help shape the development of one of England 's most powerful monarchs . " The Young Victoria " dramatizes the tumultuous transition of the young woman into power . Emily plays the queen , with a good combination of raw strength and innocence , someone who recognizes the complexity of the task at hand , but who possesses enough confidence to move forward . She is able to portray Victoria , as an astute young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand . Victoria must fend a barrage of intrusions on her way to the crown , and even when she takes command of her new position , she discovers the road to self sufficiency will depend on making some very important decisions and of course , the right support . Luckily for Victoria , there is Albert , a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate . There is amazing chemistry between the two performers , and there 's little doubt what the outcome will be , but there is the figure of Bettany 's Prime Minister , a man who provides Victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her . Miranda Richardson and Mark Strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl . Every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development , but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by Blunt , an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances . In here , she is given the breakout role of her career , a real life historical figure , who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time . She shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years . She also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes . " The Young Victoria " is not a royal epic portrayal of England 's ruling class . It is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them . In the end , the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction . In here , there is a message that good writing and good mediation can take us very far , and there is of course , a good old fashioned love story .  
0	  Very bad . Very , very bad . As a fellow who aspires to make , be in or - at least - sniff the catering table at a movie set , I find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made . However , this movie .. oh dear . Realizing Frightworld doesn't aspire to anything more than crude exploitation ( an honorable thing in itself ) and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake . And to be fair , it is more entertaining than - say - Red Zone Cuba .. but not by much . So I won't try to critique , just let me ask throw out some observations . 1 ) If gore is the point of the movie , shouldn't you be able to see it ? 2 ) If you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment . 3 ) In a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll . Difficult I know but really .. 4 ) There is a lot of talented videographers in the Buffalo / Rochester area , most you can hire really cheap . Get one who knows how to frame a scene . 5 ) Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs doesn't mean he should do so every two seconds . 6 ) Kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time , get girls who 's tops we want to see taken off . 7 ) Editing should help tell the story or set a mood . At the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags . A chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary , it 's sloppy . Some good things . Not all the acting was bad . Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid once she started fighting back . There was some neat imagery , unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason . " Acid Poptart " is a name that deserves a better movie . I like the moxie of Frightworld too . Next time , now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts , I hope all involve aspire to something better than Colman Francis . Upgrade at least Ed Wood .  
1	  I love and admire the Farrelly brothers ! How come I only got to see this great movie 3 years after it 's release ? It made me laugh , it made me cry and it reeaally warmed my heart . Big Time . It 's hard to describe in my rotten English - but I have to try anyway : The cast is excellent throughout - from the lead - to the supporting roles , the acting is great , the dialogs are great and the film is perfectly directed and edited . I think that the Farrelly brothers movies are often underestimated - they are not light comedies - they 're deep ! They talk about what life is all about ( I won't tell YOU ! ) . In my case , this movie affirmed to me what relationships are all about : If you love somebody : Set them free , let them be - try to share the passion and the pain and always be true to each other . I 'm not a sports-hater , but definitely a sports ignorant . But in this movie - the vibes get you . I could smell the atmosphere of Baseball . Finally , this movie explained to me what being a sports-fan can mean to you and what cool fan-families there must be out there . Thanks so much , Pete & Bob ! P.S. : If you haven't seen it - please check out KINGPIN !  
1	  " Who Loves The Sun " works its way through some prickly subject matter with enough wit and grace to keep the story not only engaging , but often hilarious . It 's been a while since I 've found such a thoroughly touching , thoroughly enjoyable film . The film is gorgeous , drawing the eye with beautiful scenery and tranquil landscapes . The peaceful imagery contrasts wonderfully with the tension between the very human , very flawed , and yet very likable characters . Due to the excellent cast all five of the major players are wonderfully interesting and dynamic . I recommend " Who Loves The Sun . " It 's a really funny movie that takes a poignant look at the hurts that we can inflict on each other , and the amazingly difficult but equally rewarding process of forgiveness .  
1	  Ernest Borgnine was so wasted in this movie . There was no point in putting this great actor in this movie . One of the greatest actors in the world wasted , and for what reason , none what so ever , so america if you want to put classic actors in movies DON'T WASTE THEM  
1	  This complicated western was a milestone in the career of JAMES STEWART after his return from war service , wanting to change his image by doing a western , which is largely regarded as the reason for the influx of westerns in the ' 50s since it 's very impressive . Too bad it wasn't photographed in Technicolor . Stewart wins first prize for " the gun that won the West " , but then has to spend the rest of the film trying to recover it when it 's stolen . SHELLEY WINTERS is a shady gal with an unsavory reputation and STEPHEN McNALLY is the local bad boy gunman in Dodge City . WILL GEER is Wyatt Earp and DAN DURYEA is Shelley 's bad boyfriend . And wouldn't you know that , it being a Universal-International film , TONY CURTIS and ROCK HUDSON ( both quite unknown at the time ) have bit roles . An interesting sequence features the first Indian attack , whereby CHARLES DRAKE reveals himself to be a coward who rides off , leaving Shelley alone in the horse-drawn wagon . He later redeems himself , but it 's just one of the twists and turns that has the gun passing from one unsavory hand to another-but finally ending up with the rightful owner . STEPHEN McNALLY and JAMES STEWART have quite a final shootout that is almost as melodramatic ( but not quite ) as DUEL IN THE SUN 's blazing guns finale . McNally makes the perfect villain and DAN DURYEA is equally treacherous in the kind of villainous role he played throughout the ' 40s as a low-life gunslinger . Tightly constructed story is extremely well directed by Anthony Mann , and it 's fun to see ROCK HUDSON ( credited as Young Bull ) wearing Indian war paint and TONY CURTIS as a young soldier who casts longing glances at the then slim and attractive Shelley Winters . Well worth viewing and definitely an above average story .  
0	  While most of the movie is very amateurish , the Kosher slaughter scene is played up , but not untrue . Kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches it 's skin . The Kosher slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one , or has seen the Peta film showing a Kosher slaughter , in which the animals throat is cut , and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive , conscious , and obviously suffering . We must remember that history is written by the victors . Is one even Allowed to even THINK that maybe the Nazis were right ? Doesn't it say anything that the Nazis had outlawed this vicious religious slaughter , and the Jews are still practicing it even today ?  
0	  OK , this has got 2 be one of the worst excuses 4 a movie that i have ever had the misfortune of watching . Like all other Olsen twins movies with the possible exception of new york minute , this film had no story , gaping plot holes , disgustingly putrid acting and bad filming even ! in case you haven't guessed yet I HATE MARY KATE AND ASHLEY ! The only reason i watched this was because i was really bored and nothing else was on . I wonder if the twins will EVER stop making the same stereotypical movies where they have an unbelievably stupid adventure in an exotic location and save the day meanwhile getting the help of two cute guys who drool over them immediately . The least they could would be to have a guy 4 1 of them or have them both falling 4 the same guy . The plot in this story was so imbecilic and just plain dumb . even a toddler could see the flaws in it . Maybe they should split up and start making films individually or maybe films with a different kind of story . Anyone who liked this movie was no offense-either really stupid , really artificial or has not seen any really good movie . or maybe they are really smart and just have bad cinematic choices . either way i would not recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good movie experience .. the only thing it is good 4 is some rib splitting laughter at the pathetic attempts to be cool . if you watch for laughs it 's hilarious . basically i give it 0 or less .  
1	  This episode apparently grew out of the cold war . There has been a holocaust but somehow Elizabeth Montgomery and Charles Bronson have come through unscathed . It then becomes a battle for turf . She is attracted to him and vice versa , but the instinct for survival takes over . It 's a quiet , slow moving , chess battle as they attempt to achieve trust . They come to truces but distrust takes over and they start again . Of course , the male female role of the sixties comes into play and modern viewers might find that her need to follow him is a bit offensive . But it still is captivating and interesting . Because she doesn't speak , we don't know here mind very well , but in the end we can guess .  
0	  When I saw this film on FearNet , I thought it would be a scary movie . Apparently , it wasn't . I have no clue how this movie was allowed to be featured on that site . FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies . The acting is wonderful from all the actors . I hated the story . The story was stupid . The movie starts out with a man with a scroll with a signia stamped onto it . He breaks the seal and certain disasters happen . The water turns to blood , the oceans die out , the moon turns red , etc . The female character was annoying as well . A lot of the stuff she did didn't make sense . Like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it . Coincidentally , it 's the date she 's expected to give birth to her baby and she starts freaking out about it and starts researching it and asking religious people what it all means . * Spoiler Alert * The two worst things happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God told him to murder his parents and the end where Demi Moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul into it . Here 's what happens . The mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins . Demi Moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child . She touches her child 's head , transferring her soul into the child and then dies . Then , the apocalypse stops . Why does God all of a sudden have a change of heart ? He gets furious when the Governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then he 's all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers her soul into her baby ? * End Spoiler * The movie is pretty stupid . It 's another religious end of the world propaganda piece . The acting from Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everybody else is excellent . That 's about all there is . I give this movie 2 stars out of 10 . Good acting with a lot of nonsense !  
1	  * 1/2 Scarlett Johansson , Woody Allen , Hugh Jackman , Ian McShane , Romola Garia . Directed by Woody Allen . Just after his work with Johansson on " Match Point " the two return for " Scoop " a Corky , zany and fun comic ride . When a student reporter ( Johansson ) finds out a new scoop from a deceased reporter ( McShane ) when she enters the materializer of a lame magician ( Allen ) . The scoop being of the new Tarot Card killer in London who might be preppy Peter Lyman ( Jackman ) ; while Sondra and Sid are playing detective Sondra falls in love for the handsome would be killer . Allen has finally hit a mark , not as good as " Match Point " but definitely more fun . I laughed a lot more than I expected , one of the years must sees  
1	  Story about four teenage girls growing up in California . Jeanie ( Jodie Foster ) is the most level-headed of the bunch-but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother ( Sally Kellerman ) . Annie ( Cherie Currie ) is addicted to drugs , alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father . Madge ( Marilyn Kagan ) has overprotective parents . Deirde ( Kandice Stroh ) thinks she 's more mature than the rest of them . This is nothing new from what we 've seen plenty of times before-but this one has one big difference-it 's accurate . I graduated from high school in 1980 ( when I first saw the film ) and I was surprised at how realistic it was . They got the dialogue , clothes and attitudes down completely right . Even the main song of the movie ( " On the Radio " by Donna Summer ) was a big hit before this came out . This film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because I could understand and relate to the characters . I knew girls in high school who were just like this ! The film is ( of course ) dated but it captures a time we will never see again . The acting is good on all counts with Foster giving the best performance . The relationship between her and Kellerman ( who was excellent ) was realistic and well-done . Even Scott Baio ( who has a small role as a friend of the girls ) more or less realistically played a teen boy . A very good movie-essential viewing if you came of age in 1980 . The film has a deserved R rating ( plenty of drug use and swearing ) but should be seen by all teens . I give it a 8 .  
1	  This begins a wager between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist .. Poe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle . Well , of course he can , but will he come out unscathed ? Hard to say with all these strange people that aren't supposed to be there wandering around , including the icy Barbara Steele . This is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in French and English , and switches back and forth a few times . Perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost ? It 's also rather dark and claustrophobic , being that one doesn't see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate , plus there 's a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times . This version ( on Synapse ) is also uncensored and I wondered what might be censored in a film from 1964 until I saw the topless scene , I guess that might be it . Overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white . Barbara Steele definitely makes the movie too . 8 out of 10 .  
1	  Brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues of Leopold Bloom , Stephen Dedalus , and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick in recreating the endearing portrait of Dublin on June 16 , 1904 - Bloomsday - a day to be celebrated - double entendre intended ! Bravo director Strick , screenwriter Haines , as well as casting director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece . Gunter Grass ' novel , The Tin Drum filmed by Volker Schlöndorff ( 1979 ) is another fine film adaptation of interior monologue which I favorably compare with Strick 's film . While there are clearly recognized Dublin landmarks in the original novel and in the film , there are also recognizable characters , although with different names in the novel . For example , Buck Mulligan with whom Dedalus lives turns out to be a then prominent Dublin surgeon . This film for all of its excellence is made even richer by additional viewings .

0	  When I was kid back in the 1970s a local theatre had Children 's Matinees every Saturday and Sunday afternoon ( anybody remember those ? ) . They showed this thing one year around Christmas time . Me and some friends went to see it . I expected a cool Santa Claus movie . What I got was a terribly dubbed ( you can tell ) and truly creepy movie . Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the Magician ( don't ask me what those two are doing in the same movie ) fighting Satan ( some joker in a silly devil costume complete with horns ! ) . The images had me cringing in my seat . I always found Santa spooky to begin with so that didn't help . The guy in the Satan suit didn't help . But what REALLY horrified me were the wooden rein deers that pulled Santa 's sled . When he wound them up and the creepy sound they made and the movements-I remember having nightmares about those things ! All these years later I still remember walking out of that theatre more than a little disturbed by what I saw . My friends were sort of frightened by it too . I just saw an ad for it on TV and ALL those nightmares came roaring back . This is a creepy , disturbing little Christmas film that will probably scare the pants off any little kid who sees it . Avoid this one-unless you really want to punish your kids . This gets a 1 .  
0	  First off I really enjoyed Zombi 2 by Lucio Fulci . This film was utter trash . I couldn't stand to watch it . The storyline was a joke , the acting was a joke , and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 is even more a joke . We jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 THE HARMFUL AGENT BRINING People BACK TO LIFE . Whatever , this movie isn't worth the $ 1.00 it cost to rent it . I really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one was horrible . If Zombi 3 is an indicator for how zombi 4 and 5 are going to be I think I will just skip them . Zombi 2 is an awesome flique tho .  
1	  Italy produced a lot of really great and original horror films in the 1960 's - and this is certainly one of them ! The first thing you will notice about Danse Macabre is the style of the film . Shot in beautiful black and white , and due to director Antonio Margheriti 's use of lighting ; the film almost looks like it could be a German expressionistic horror film . This , coupled with the horror-filled plot line ensures that Danse Macabre is a film that truly captures the essence of horror . Of course , the fact that the beautiful Barbara Steele appears in the film doesn't harm matters - and the good news continues as , in this film , she gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in the films that made her famous . The plot is very aware of the time in which this was released , and so incorporates the great Edgar Allen Poe . We follow Alan Foster , a writer who accepts a bet from Poe himself and Lord Blackwood that he can't spend an entire night in the latter 's creepy old castle . Everyone that has spent the night there previously has died .. and our hero is about to meet the previous wager-takers ! Nowadays , horror films don't tend to focus so much on each shot and the result is that there isn't much beauty left in the genre . It is refreshing , therefore , to see this film . Many of the shots here are incredibly beautiful - from the female side of the couple wearing just a see-through skirt , to my personal favourite - a shot of smoke creeping in from under a door . This my first Antonio Margheriti film , and even after seeing just this one ; it 's obvious that he was one of Italy 's premier directors . Also interesting is the fact that screenplay was co-written by another of the Italian greats ; Django creator Sergio Corbucci . The plot can meander a little too much at times , but there 's always enough atmosphere on hand to make sure that the film never becomes boring - and the fact that it is always intriguing , even when the plot slows down , ensures the same thing . The way that Danse Macabre utilises the ' haunted house ' theme is both well done and original , and helps to keep the story as eerie as possible . On the whole , fans of Italian and / or cult cinema will not want to miss this little gem !  
0	  Near the beginning of " The Godfather : Part II , " Michael Corleone 's son wants to drop out of law school and become a musician . Michael Corleone does not want this . But his estranged ex-wife , Kay , manages to convince him to let Anthony Corleone pursue music as he wishes . So he does . That seems like an odd way to start a review , as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action . Just bear with me here ; you 'll see where I 'm going with this eventually . Now let me tell you about the major plot . It is about Michael Corleone wanting to quit crime for good ( he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business ) . But then along comes Vincent Mancini , an illegitimate nephew , who is involved in a feud . So of course Michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff . Meanwhile , Vincent has a semi-incestuous affair with Michael 's daughter Mary . Oh , and Michael and Kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of Part II . It is like a soap opera . One horrid , awful , 169-minute soap opera . Gone is any sort of the sophistication , romance , and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard . After a 16-year break in the franchise , Francis Ford Coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films , once again proving his last great work was " Apocalypse Now " back in the 1970 's . What 's worse , " The Godfather : Part II " isn't even a logical follow-up of " The Godfather : Part II . " Michael is a completely different person . He hasn't just gone to seed ( which might be legitimate , even if it 'd be no fun to watch ) . He 's become a goody-goody that 's trying to fix all the tragedy that made Part II such a devastating masterpiece . His confession to the priest was bad enough , but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating . He also gets back together with Kay ! For heaven 's sakes , there is absolutely no way that should happen , as the 2nd movie made abundantly clear ! She aborted his baby , and his Sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it . Didn't Francis Ford Coppola even think of these things ? And don't even get me started on Mary and Vincent 's affair ! For a romance so forbidden , it was shockingly unengaging . Sofia Coppola 's acting did nothing to help . She made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it , because she was possibly THE worst actress I have ever seen in a Best Picture nominee . Every line she delivered was painfully memorized , and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities , all she elicited was inappropriate giggles . In the climactic scene-I won't go into detail , but you 'll know which scene I 'm talking about when / if you watch it-she looks at Michael and says , " .. Daddy ? " I think I was meant to cry , but the line was delivered so poorly I burst out into long , loud laughter ! Now we get to the climax , and now you will also realize why I took time to start the review with a description of Anthony Corleone 's musical ambitions . After 140 minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances , Anthony Corleone returns .. with an opera ! So Michael , Kay , Mary , and Vincent go to see it , and for about 10-15 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate Michael . About this climactic sequence , I must say one thing : It was really good ! But not because of the killers-they were pretty boring . I just really liked the opera . It had some great music and real great set pieces . And , from what little it showed us , it seemed that the story had echoes of the Corleone family 's origin . I 'll bet it was one swell opera , and I 'll bet Michael Corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to music . My biggest wish is this : that Francis Ford Coppola had merely filmed Anthony Corleone 's opera for 169 minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama . Better yet , I wish he hadn't made " The Godfather : Part II " at all . Part II gave us the perfect ending . This spin off was self-indulgent and unnecessary . P.S. This is not a gut reaction to the film . I watched all 3 Godfather films over a month ago ( though I was rewatching the first one ) . Not only does this mean that my expectations for Part II weren't screwed ( in fact , I had set the bar rather low for it after what I heard ) , but it also means I 've had a good time to think about all three films . While I was a bit disappointed with Part II at first , the more I thought about it , the better it seemed . But with Part II , it was bad to begin with , then got worse the more I thought about it . The sad thing is that many people will stop with Part I , but if they watch Part II as well , they will most likely go on to Part II . If you have the will , watch Parts I & II and pretend like Part II never existed .  
1	  Acting This film is a very well acted film . I will say that the performances are slightly weak at times ; but for the most part , the acting is very good . The only actor that blew me away with his performance was Jude Law as Harlen Maguire . He was incredible ! Tom Hanks seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible . Paul Newman , good as always . Cinematography This is what made the movie a masterpiece ( and I rarely use that word ) . Conrad Hall is a true genius . If at any point in the movie you were to pause it , you will see the delicately crafted work of this man . He sets up every shot so that nothing is left out . When the camera is still , there is a postcard like quality to the screen . When the camera is moving , every shot is planned to understated perfection . But it doesn't stop there . Conrads choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art . The way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work I 've seen . His work on this movie made it what it is . This movie is at the top of the list for best Cinematography with LOTR , Black Hawk Down , Hero , CTHD , Moulin Rouge , and Vertigo . Story People will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but , I believe they missed the point of the movie . It is a love story about a hit-man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose . It is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other . The screen Writing is worthy of an Oscar . Music Thomas Newman conducts a sad but hopeful score to intensify this sad but hopeful story . The music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores I 've herd . Direction Sam Mendes is a new director with a feel of an experienced director . The symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a rarity in todays film-making world . I will be on the lookout for the next Sam Mendes Film . 10/10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies I 've ever seen .  
0	  .. at least during its first half . If it had started out with the three buddies in the navy and concentrated on the naval action scenes , it would have been a much better and tighter film . The second half of the film is worth it , especially for the action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships , but it 's like a dull toothache getting there . Also , don't watch this film just because Ginger Rogers is in it . She has an important role , but it 's a small one . The film starts out showing three New York City buddies working the tourist trade and also in good-natured competition for the hand of Sally ( Ginger Rogers ) , a singing candy salesgirl along the avenue . World War I breaks out , the three buddies seem completely indifferent to the struggle , yet enlist in the navy anyways . The one of the three with the least industry as a civilian ( Bill Boyd as Baltimore ) winds up the commanding officer to the other two ( Robert Armstrong as Dutch and James Gleason as Skeets ) . To make matters more complex , Sally has fallen in love with one of the three , but doesn't have the chance to tell him before the three sail off to war . The film is a little more interesting on board ship , mainly because of the close shots we have of the ship itself , and also because the chemistry among the three buddies is believable . However , James Gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to be a swabby , especially when the sign at the enlistment office said you had to be between 17 and 35 to be eligible . One real obvious flaw in the film that made me believe that everything outside the naval scenes was slapped together with minimum care is the costume design , or , I should say , the lack of it . In the scenes in New York just prior to WWI we have everyone dressed in the fashions of 1931 and everyone driving the cars of 1931 - no effort was taken to bring this film into period . In conclusion , if you watch the few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them and the last 45 minutes involving the naval suicide mission , you 've seen everything here worth seeing . The rest is padding .  
0	  Anyone who 's watched a few Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that gets brushed off the planning table . So , when crazed Lara moves into Patti 's home and methodically begins to drive her landlady bonkers , I didn't even blink . When Lara eventually ramps up her activities to threatening poor Patti , and dares her to do anything about it , I just nodded . You see , on Planet LMN , people don't behave the way they do for any particular reason , they just do it to keep the action going . Only on Planet LMN could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers ! Poor Patti - she just trusted too much , and Lara went off her medicine , and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly stuff that ends up injected into someone 's tummy , and a body bag going out the front door . The horror ! But take it from me , this Planet LMN product is a classic . You need to watch it once , just for the great laughs you 'll have . On the Improbability Scale , I give this film a 95/100 . Make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices , too . You 'll understand later .  
0	  The Order starts in Rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts & demons named Brother Dominic ( Francesco Carnelutti ) is found dead , cut to New York City where one of his order Alex Bernier ( Heath Ledger ) is contacted by top-brass Cardinal Driscoll ( Peter Weller ) who ask 's him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Dominic 's death . Along with his girlfriend Mara Willims ( Shannyn Sossamon ) & fellow priest Thomas Garrett ( Mark Addy ) Alex travels to Italy to delve into his mentor 's death , as the truth begins to emerge it appears that Dominic was a ' Sin Eater ' someone who absorbed other 's sins & lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully & that the Church wasn't happy about his activities . Alex must do what 's right even if it goes against what he believes .. Also know under the title The Sin Eater this American German co-production was written , produced & directed by Bian Helgeland & didn't really do that much for me if I 'm honest & I usually am , honest that is . Anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some OK ideas but it 's throughly predictable , excruciatingly dull & boring , really silly at times & it takes itself far too seriously . The whole concept is daft & while it thinks it 's clever with it 's oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up & brings the story full circle I thought it was the most obvious & lazy way to end things . There 's the usual religious themes here , morality , sin , forgiveness , faith , belief , prophecy 's , blah , blah , blah you know the sort of thing . Then there 's the twists which aren't hard to see coming , there 's the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen , corruption , greed , evil , etc . you know the sort of clichéd Hollywood ideals & themes that get reused every time it deals with the Church . The Order has nothing new to say & as a serious piece of film-making it sucks , a lot . I 'm not too sure who The Order is meant to appeal to , as a die-hard horror fan I didn't see much horror in this at all , as a thriller it 's less than thrilling , as a mystery it 's too predictable & there 's nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest & for some reason I cannot figure out the IMDb also lists The Order as an action film which is absurd as it 's as exciting & action-packed as the average episode of Sesame Street ( 1969 - present ) , harsh maybe but it 's what I think .. Director Helgeland does an OK job , the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme & it all looks a bit drab , grayish & dull . For a supposed horror film The Order is very light on scares or horror elements , in fact there aren't any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason , don't ask . Forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any which is fine but it would have helped at least make The Order somewhat watchable . According the IMDb 's ' Trivia ' section the release date of The Order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny , all I can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they aren't exactly brilliant as it stands now . I was amazed to see The Order had a budget of about $ 28,000,000 which is a hell of a lot of money & I just can't see where it all went apart from the sets & production design which are good . The whole film looks & feels very average & utterly forgettable . The acting is OK although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul-mouthed comic relief irritates , a good actor such as Peter Weller deserves better than this . The Order , I prefer the title The Sin Eater actually not that it matters too much , misses all of it 's intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as I 'm concerned & is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so don't do it ! Not recommended .  
0	  As others have noted , this should have been an excellent Hammer-style film , and it seems to me that that 's how most of the actors were instructed to play it .. but the screenplay is so leaden , poorly paced , and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies ( poor Timothy Dalton is saddled with most of them ) that it 's all too overblown and self-important . This is an uncharacteristically weak performance from Dalton , although he quietly nails the climactic scene where Dr. Rock finally realizes what he 's done . The only actor who comes off really well is Patrick Stewart who is a most welcome sight . Freddie Francis may have been a great cinematographer , but he was a lousy director .  
1	  Watching Fire and Ice for the first time reminded me of my experience seeing 300 last year . It wasn't at all a bad movie , certainly not average , but its plotting and dialog stuck out as being at best conventional and at worst kind of confusing and one-dimensional ( which , perhaps as based on Frank Miller 's comic book , was the right decision to go with ) . But its primary strengths drew from the intense action and bloody battles and having that jolt of a 14 year old feeling watching beefcake men fighting in bloody sword-led combat , with the occasional freaky creature or super-hot female to go with the painterly surroundings . While I would probably re-watch Fire and Ice before 300 again , they both aroused that similar feeling - the exception this time being , naturally , that it 's Frank Frazetta , the infamous artist and designer of countless paperback books and comics , collaborating with director Ralph Bakshi , in what isn't typical Hollywood fare but something for the die-hard fans . What this means for audiences today going back to check out the film for the first time ( it may now be coveted nostalgia for those who were young and watched it along with their Masters of the Universe VHS tapes back in the day ) is the possible cons mentioned before and , maybe , that you will see something somewhat unique . Fire and Ice isn't even the only Bakshi rotoscoped feature , but it 's possibly the most fluid - if not quite my personal favorite - of the few he made , and he and his team create a whole striking world that 's part pre-historic , part out of this world fantastic , and part medieval , and all touched up with a painters hand with respect to the backgrounds , the skies and grounds . There 's a slight drawback for Bakshi fans in this facet of character design ; Bakshi went as far as to say it 's more Frazetta than him . This may be true , but it doesn't make it any more absorbing to the eye or curious in those moments where we don't see people killed or gutted in quick or slow motion ( my favorite was the momentary skeleton-guide - how they rotoscoped that amazes me ) . I neglect describing the plot as it would defeat the purpose of really recommending it . If you 're already a die-hard into this kind of style and approach of animation the plot will matter depending on what degree two warring factions or a ' damsel ' or princess is in danger or a hero has to prove himself or yada yada , so suffice to say it 's about , well , Fire against Ice , with characters named Nekron and Darkwolf ( the coolest male of the lot and most comic-book in appearance ) and Teegra ( the typical hottie who 's almost * too * perfect for the adolescent male fantasy figure ) . What the plot does do , as an asset , is allow a series of cliffhangers and suspense bits around the action , the progression of the danger in the oncoming big battle , like when the ogres are hunting after Teegra and have to contend with sudden crazy monsters and creatures popping out of tree trunks and lakes . And per usual for Bakshi , he conjures up some craziness ( if not quite his usual inspired lunacy ) in the midst of all of this straightforward fantasy material . If you 've seen Wizards , you 'll understand what I mean to a lesser extent . So , if you 're an animation buff , seek this out right away for some ' old-school ' ( i.e. 1980s ) action and incredible design . For everyone else , it 's .. good , not great , as I would say without fault about its logical 21st century extension , with some alterations , 300 .  
1	  It was hard for me to believe all of the negative comments regarding this all-star flick . I laughed through the entire picture , as did my entire family . The movie clearly defined itself as an old time gangster comedy-the players were hysterical-I 'll bet they had a good old time while making it . Of course Goldblum and Dreyfuss were great-and how about those Everly sisters , each of the two Falco 's , and the divine music throughout . Rob Reiner made a great laughing limo driver , and Gabriel Byrne a laughable neurotic . Not to mention Gregory Hines , Burt Reynolds , the Sleepy Joe character and the whole mortuary and grave digger references . Paul Anka was his usual entertaining self , with the added attraction of running scared after Byrne decided to make a duet of his " My Way " welcome home to Vick performance . I am of the opinion that this movie was a comical tribute to Frank Sinatra and friends ; Dreyfuss imitated him well . I am also of the opinion that no one , of any age , would even think of imitating the actions which occurred in this movie-it 's a joke-not a terrifying " gangsta " film . The cars and clothing were impressive , as was the decorative , " Vic 's Place . " Truly , I think of " Mad Dog Time " as a musical comedy , less harmful than many cartoons , TV crime dramas , and talk shows . I would recommend the video for an evening of family entertainment .  
0	  This is hands down the worst movie I can ever remember watching . Everything was unbelievably cliché and retarded . The acting was horrible too . The camera work wasn't bad but that still couldn't redeem it . The writer / director of this film must suffer from down 's syndrome if he believed this movie would help his career . I want the hour and a half of my life back that I wasted watching this crap . I would rather watch a video of the grass growing than this . I cant believe IMDb is making me write 10 lines in order to post this but I feel that this movie is so bad that I must continue to warn others about it . The reason I came about this movie is that my girlfriend requested it from the local library thinking that it was the Kris Kristoferson movie which ended up being entitled " Disappearances " . I don't know whose fault it was for this garbage ending up in my DVD player but I feel that someone owes me at least $ 20 for my time , pain and suffering . In conclusion , the director / writer of this movie better hope i ever recognize him on the street .  
0	  This was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies I 've seen in a very long time . I 've never liked Spike Lee , but thought I 'd give this one a try : bad mistake . The movie is supposed to show how the Son of Sam real life murders affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977 ; what it really did was center around the most boring characters that I doubt anyone cared for as far as their drug problems , marriage problems , and so on , etc . The scenes that depict the murders are just that , and nothing more ; a shooting and then it 's back to Saturday Night Fever ! What 's even more ridiculous is Spike Lee 's choice to show up as a reporter in the movie : Spike , trust me , you 're no Hitchcock , stay out of the movies , it makes them even worse off . The most silly scene had to be the dog speaking in a goofy voice , which was depicted in a scene before it where it was supposed to have been shot ? Spike , what were you thinking when you made this film ? Not thinking at all is my guess . People who think they 'll see a crime drama , take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser . You 're better off watching Jerry Springer in this case ! Waste of film , I gave it a 1 out of 10 : awful dud .  
1	  FULL OF SPOILERS . This is a pretty fast and enjoyable crime thriller based on Ira Levin 's play about two gay playwrights ( Caine and Reeve ) that plot the murder of one 's rich wife ( Cannon ) to get the property and the insurance . The plot succeeds but Christopher Reeve as the younger and less established of the two writers decides to make a play out of the actual murder - with only slight changes in the details . Reeve allows that Easthampton , Long Island , can become Southampton , Long Island , in the script , for instance . The rest of the play 's plot is a dead giveaway and to tell the truth Reeve doesn't mind a little gossip or even an inquiry into Cannon 's apparently accidental death . It will boost the revenues and his own Warhol quotient . Michael Caine is Sidney Bruhl , the megabucks-making playwright whose last four productions bombed and who would like nothing more than to quietly get back to working on a new play , perhaps with Reeve 's input , that would redeem his reputation . He cannot permit Reeve 's scandalous play-a-clef to be produced . So - what else ? - he tries to murder him . In the end they wind up killing one another , the manuscript is appropriated by their neighbor , the psychic Helga Tensdoorp , and she makes a million bucks selling it to Broadway . It 's a lot of fun for a number of reasons . One is the production design . That multi-roomed , multi-storied house with the big windmill atop , situated on nine of what must be the most valuable acres on earth ( Easthampton ! ) would be a splendid set of digs anywhere . You wouldn't be able to afford a pup tent in Easthamptom . The house is not overly large or baroque in its decor . It 's just magnificently modest , although it 's a little tidy for my tastes , the kind of house that 's so clean you 're afraid to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving the imprint of a foot . Next , the acting could hardly be improved upon . Caine , Cannon , and Fred Jones are superb . Dyan Cannon gives a pitch-perfect performance as the anxious wife whose slacks are so tight they look as if they 'd been sprayed on , which is okay given her assets . Even Reeve , whose talent was limited , seems to find a comfortable niche in his role of affable but psychopathic murderer . Irene Worth , as the psychic neighbor Helga , was in some way hard to define , a mistake . Granted she - or someone like her - was necessary to the plot , but , my God , what an offensive snoop her character is , going around and claiming , " I feel pain in zis woom ! " I suppose in order to make her a little more interesting , she 's got up in sweats and a goofy looking cap with bicycle reflectors on it . Still , she 's a nuisance from beginning to end . You have to love Ira Levin 's bitchy dialog . The distraught Caine begs Reeve to tell him why he wrote the tell-all play . " Because it 's THERE , Sidney ! " says Reeve , and Caine shouts , " That 's MOUNTAINS , not PLAYS ! Plays aren't there until some * hole WRITES them ! " Great too is Caine 's call to the police after his wife drops dead of fright , as planned . He works himself up into a torrent of sobs , barely able to speak , as he reports the incident and implores that an ambulance be sent immediately . When he hangs up , his face assumes its usual placid expression , he blows his nose into his handkerchief , and walks away , all business again . The climax , though suitably ironic , is confusing and noisy and full of artifice , lacking in the wicked charm that Levin and Lumet brought to the earlier scenes . The score is mostly made up of light-hearted riffs on the harpsichord , neatly fitting into the film . You 'll probably enjoy it .  
1	  This movie is perfect for families to watch together . It is a great film and it deserves more credit . The special effects are stunning and spectacular . Everyone who has children should share this with theirs .  
0	  With the releasing of " Farligt förflutet " Swedish film industry has truly hit rock bottom . Stefan ( Jens Hultén ) has for the past years lived a calm life with his wife Marie ( Regina Lund ) . One day an old friend of Stefan´s arrives with a favor to ask him . Stefan is to do a small courier job . He is supposed to bring a suitcase filled with heroine through the Sweden-Germany customs . Unfortunately things in Germany don´t work out as planned and Stefan is now in big trouble . It is always nice to see a Swedish film that breaks the traditional family-drama pattern . Unfortunately if the people involved in the production have no clue of how a movie is supposed to be written , filmed or cut the result can only be catastrophic . The content can be concluded with : bad acting , an incoherent plot and idiotic dialogs . The only highlight in the movie is the unprovoked sex-scene wit the incredibly beautiful Regina Lund . This lasts for only a few seconds leaving approxamitly 90 minutes of pure , let´s say what it truly is , crap .  
1	  " Mr. Harvey Lights a Candle " is anchored by a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall . While we can predict that his titular morose , up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past , how his emotions are unveiled is surprising . Spall 's range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the Mike Leigh repertory . While an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes , such as on " The Simpsons , " this central situation of a visit to Salisbury Cathedral in Rhidian Brook 's script is well-contained and structured for dramatic purposes , and is almost formally divided into acts . We 're introduced to the urban British range of racially and religiously diverse kids ( with their uniforms I couldn't tell if this is a " private " or " public " school ) , as they gather  the rapping black kids , the serious South Asians and Muslims , the white bullies and mean girls  but conveyed quite naturally and individually . The young actors , some of whom I recognized from British TV such as " Shameless , " were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures . Celia Imrie puts more warmth into the supervisor 's role than the martinets she usually has to play . A break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious . We think , like the teacher portrayed by Ben Miles of " Coupling , " that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance , but it 's much more about faith in people as well as God , which is why the BBC showed it in England at Easter time and BBC America showed it in the U.S. over Christmas . Nathalie Press , who was also so good in " Summer of Love , " has a key role in Mr. Harvey 's redemption that could have been played for movie of the week preaching , but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way ( unfortunately I saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials ) . While it is a bit heavy-handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip " a pilgrimage , " this quiet film was the best evocation of " good will towards men " than I 've seen in most holiday-themed TV movies .  
0	  This is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative . It lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection . The animation is well done but I feel like it is too presentational . I would have preferred more images from behind , more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me . But for a Hollywood style film it works OK but it is very derivative of Aardman films and this is bothering to me . Perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice-over . I think the voice over is too glib .  
1	  There are many illnesses born in the mind of man which have been given life in modern times . Constant vigilance or accrued information in the realm of Pyschosis , have kept psychologists , counselors and psychiatrists busy with enough work to last them decades . Occasionally , some of these mental phenomenon are discover by those with no knowledge of their remedy or even of their existence . That is the premise of the film entitled " The Night Listner . " It tells the story of a popular radio host called Gabriel Noon ( Robin Williams ) who spends his evenings enthralling his audiences with vivid stories about Gay lifestyles . Perhaps its because his show is losing it 's authentic veneer which causes Noon to admit he is no longer himself . Feeling abandoned by both his lover Jess ( Bobby Cannavale ) and his and best friend ( Joe Morton ) , he seeks shelter in his deepening despair and isolation . It is here , a mysterious voice in the night asks him for help . Noon needs to feel useful and reaches out to the desperate voice which belongs to a 14 year old boy called Peter ( Rory Culkin ) . In reading the boy 's harrowing manuscript which depicts the early life and sexual abuse at the hands of his brutal parents , Noon is captivated and wants to help . However , things are not what they seem and Noon soon finds himself en-wrapped in an elusive and bizarre tale torn right out of a medical nightmare . This movie is pure Robin Williams and were it not for Toni Collette who plays Donna D. Logand , Sandra Oh as Anna and John Cullum as pop , this might be comical . Instead , this may prove to be one of William 's more serious performances . *  
1	  Kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any Shakespearean drama , and the acting is true to the story , with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale . It is touching , funny and intriguing in all parts . The character development is near perfect , the cinematography is vivid and engaging , and the story draws you in . I would like to say that the " Samurai freaks " and those obsessed with late 18th and 19th century dynastic tales of Japan may snub this film as not Kurosawa 's best work . Perhaps not his best , but even at his worst , Kurosawa is better than many of the best . This story is so based in elevating the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change , that it is timeless , despite being set in the not-so-distant past . I would heartily recommend this to any movie buff , and especially to those who are likely to continue on to read the novel on which the film is based .  
1	  This was one of those films I probably never would have picked off the shelf , but it came on IFC one day and I said - Eric Stolz , William Forsythe .. why not ? If I 'd changed the channel , I would have really missed a treasure . The subject is depressing - young author paralyzed in climbing accident convalesces in lower-class rehabilitation center . It would have been so easy and tempting to make this a manipulative tear-jerker . But , that doesn't happen because it was written by Neal Jimenez , after he himself was accidently paralyzed . No Hollywood happiness here . All of the patients in the ward come from wildly different backgrounds , but they share a feeling of helplessness , of being at the mercy of others . Stolz is very good as a " lone wolf " type , forced into embarrassing dependence on his girlfriend ( Helen Hunt ) ; Wesley Snipes is fine as a former ladies ' man whose family is falling apart ; but William Forsythe takes the cake as a tough guy determined to make someone pay for taking away his independence . See this film .  
1	  This is one of the best animated family films of all time . Moreover , virtually all of the serious rivals for this title came from the same creative mind of Hiyao Miyazaki and his Studio Ghibli . Specifically , other great films include " My Neighbor Totoro " and " Kikki 's Delivery Service . " Spirited Away is quite good , but a bit too creepy for typical family fare - better for teenagers and adult . The one thing that sets " Laputa : Castle in the Sky " apart from other films by Miyazaki is that it is far more of a tension-filled adventure ride . Why is this film so good ? Because it 's a complete package : the animation is very well done , and the story is truly engaging and compelling . Most Japanese anime is imaginative , but decidedly dark or cynical or violent ; and the animation itself is often jerky , stylized , and juvenile . None of these problems plague Castle in the Sky . It has imagination to burn , and the characters are well drawn , if slightly exaggerated versions of realistic people . ( None of those trench-coat wearing posers ) There is plenty of adventure , but not blood and gore . The animation is smooth , detailed , and cinematic ally composed - not a lot of flat shots . The backgrounds are wonderful . The voice acting in the dubbed English version is first rate , particularly the two leads , Pazo ( James Van der Beek ) and Sheeta ( Anna Paquin ) . The sound engineering is great , too . Use your studio sound , if you 've got it . One aspect that I particularly enjoyed is that much of the back story is left unexplained . Laputa was once inhabited , and is now abandoned . Why ? We never know . We know as much as we need to know , and then we just have to accept the rest , which is easy to do because the invented world is so fully realized . Indeed , it is fair to say that the world is more fully realized than most of the minor characters , who are for the most part one-dimensional stock characters ( e.g. , gruff general , silly sidekick , kooky old miner , etc . ) Highly recommended for people aged 6 to 60 !  
1	  This is a great movie if viewed in the proper context - It was meant to be a parody of teen horror devil worship movies ( and the ' 80s saw plenty of them ) ! I saw this movie when it first came out , and instantly liked it . Being a big fan of KISS , it was great to see Gene in the movie . And anything with OZZY as a metal-hating preacher can't be all bad ! Also , Fastway was already a favorite of mine , so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack . The original VHS ( this was pre-DVD ) cover for Trick Or Treat featured an illustration of Sammi kneeling , playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a " demon " looking on . It was a special order , and the price for the VHS copy at the time ( circa 1987 ) was $ 90 ! I really wanted the movie , but not at that ridiculous price . The ' OZZY-Gene ' cover was only created for the $ 5 re-release . The company releasing it probably figured Gene and OZZY were the only recognizable people in the movie , so they had better put ' em on the cover ! Same thing with the original " Little Shop Of Horrors " - Jack Nicholson was in it for all of five minutes , but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star . I have a " Trick Or Treat " web site , and it 's surprising how many people believe Sammi Curr was a real person ! Fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to ' Sammi Curr ' . All-in-all , it was just a good time , rock-n-roll movie . Definitely not to be taken too seriously , but just enjoyed !  
0	  Drew Barrymore is an actress that has gone through bad periods , not only in her career , but in her personal life too . After being a prodigy child actress she descended into obscurity with mediocre films of low quality . While she has recovered from that dark past , this movie stays as a reminder of Drew Barrymore 's worst days . The movie starts with an interesting premise , very reminiscent to Brian De Palma 's " Raising Cain " ; with a plot dealing with multiple personality disorder that sets the story for a horror / thriller . Barrymore stars as Holly Gooding , a young woman who is trying to make a new life in California after a traumatic event of her past in which apparently her other personality killed her mother . Suddenly , her past returns to haunt her as her evil personality is back in her life willing to ruin her new found peace and her new found love . In the middle of the chaos his new boyfriend , Patrick Highsmith ( George Newbern ) , will try to help Holly to face the demons of her past . Unlike De Palma 's underrated thriller , " Doppelganger " is for the most part a mediocre film that not only never fulfills it 's purpose , it also concludes in one of the worst endings of movie history . While Barrymore is definitely not at her best , she manages to keep her dignity with an above average performance . The rest of the cast however range from mediocre to painfully bad over-the-top performances , although Leslie Hope manages to be among the best of them . The script is full of clichés and De Palma 's influence is quite obvious . While the movie tries to be original by making literary references in almost every line , the dialogs are dull and the wooden acting certainly doesn't do any good . It has a fair share of nudity and for strange reasons , and excessive use of special effects . The make-up effects are done by the outstanding KNB and are really among the few good things in the movie . However , the bizarre over-use of the effects in the totally out of context ending decreases the impact of KNB 's work and makes cheesy what in a different movie would be amazing . The fact that this is a B-Movie is no excuse for it 's low quality , as with a better and more coherent script this could had been an interesting movie . Sadly , all we have here is a mediocre film that gets worse every second . Worthy for Barrymore 's beauty . 3/10  
0	  Spoiler alert  although I think this one was spoiled coming out of the can It 's hard to even imagine that a film with these stars , from this studio , made at this time period , could be so awful , but it is . It is the film 's biggest flaw by far that it just doesn't make any damn sense . Rich widower American aristocrat Penn Gaylord leaves his small daughter " in charge " and goes off to World War I where he is killed . Then we flash forward to present day ( 1942 ) and total confusion . The three sisters are in court where they are said to have spent the last twenty years , and some jerk named Barclay is trying to take their home away from them . This is just the beginning of an endless series of unanswered questions that comprises the script , more holes in it than The Warren Report . What happened to the Gaylord fortune ? If the will is worth half a billion , why has the family home gone from an opulent palace to the house on The Munsters ? Who the devil is this Barclay clown ? And why is he able to take someone 's home away from them ? The questions just pile on top of more questions . The usually affable and charming George Brent is playing Barclay , who is inexplicably a total sod tromping all over everyone , taking whatever the heck he wants no matter who it belongs to and without a twinge of guilt ; yet no one besides Fiona ( Barbara Stanwick ) seems to particularly dislike this cretin . Why ? None of these questions are ever answered . We instead just follow Fiona 's life from one train wreck to another , the evil Barclay takes away her home , her fortune , and even her child . What does she do ? Shoot him ? Set him on fire ? No , too logical . In a completely improbably wrap-up , this woman , who 's only prior romantic involvement with Barclay was , save for the technicality of marriage , rape , suddenly decides mid-sentence ( literally ) that she does not hate him , she loves him . And they 're going to live happily ever after . All of a sudden for no reason in the world , this early female role model of independence and authority is transformed into the usual helpless ankle-twisting twit more commonly found in films of this era . Yeah , sure , steal everything in the world that belongs to me and I 'll fall in love with you . On what planet does that happen ? I can only guess the reason I never heard of this film before I happened to catch it on Turner is that it was as lost on contemporary audiences as it is today .  
1	  Mardi Gras : Made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but , are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another . David Redmon open your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in china manufactures beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in America for up to 20 dollars . When Redmon questions Americans about where these beads come from they had no clue and seemed dumb founded . When he told them that they are made in China for less then nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions , Americans seemed sad , hurt , and a little remorseful but didn't really seem that they would stop purchasing the beads after finding out the truth . When Redmon questioned the workers in china they did not know that Americans were wearing them over their necks and paid so much for these beads . The workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and couldn't believe it . This movie is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own . M. Pitts  
1	  There are 21 comments as I add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism . This is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it . It is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my 15-year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action , to the humour and even to the beautiful music score . I buy DVDs only when I know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the UK , I will certainly be adding it to my collection .  
1	  Interesting characters , lots of tension . As close to black and white without being black and white . I was turned off by how casually the supposedly sympathetic mainstream character , a quiet , near deaf secretary , was able to turn to crime to ruin colleagues , rough up people in her way and finally participate in a heist , and set up someone to be bumped off as a decoy to her own get-away . I 'm a little put off by the trend for otherwise quality movies to portray criminals in a sympathetic way without addressing the injury they 've done to others other than to portray their immediate opponents as jerks . In this film we never know who 's money it really is they abscond with , or what happens to the innocent wife who the sympathetic deaf-secretary uses to set up the of the sleazy bar owner to take the fall for the missing loot . Too bad , the film could have been great .  
1	  Director Douglas Sirk once said ` there 's a very short distance between high art and trash , and trash that contains craziness is by this very quality nearer to art ' . This statement defines his cinema perfectly , a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations , adventure and war films , westerns and of course , his famous melodramas . Sirk 's melodramas were , as the very word signifies , dramas with music . The music sets the tone for his masterful style , and every stroke of his brush ( Sirk was also a painter ) leaves a powerful image on the screen-turned-canvas . But this ain't life but its representation , an imitation of life . Sirk never tried to show reality , on the contrary . None of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by Hollywood ( most notably Technicolor ) to distinguish the artificial from the real thing . Let 's remember that his golden period coincides with the time when Hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama ( Blackboard jungle , Rebel without a cause ) . Sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something else . Another of Sirk 's statements summarizes this : ` You can't reach , or touch , the real . You just see reflections . If you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass ' . I defy anybody that has seen Written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen . One ends up giving up . Therefore , we are in a hall full of mirrors where there 's no difference between real and its false copy . Nobody can say that the Hadley are real people . That town ain't real either , with those hideous oil pumps all over the place . So in this realm the acting is affected , the decore is fake , the trick is visible . Everything is pushed a little bit off the limit ( the sexual connotations of Dorothy Malone with the oil tower , for example ) . Sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same time . ` The angles are the director 's thoughts ; the lighting is his philosophy ' . In Written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows . The Hadleys house , with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way . A house that resembles a mausoleum , that no party can cheer up . As tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night , Sirk 's photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters , and so are the colours of the clothes they wear . Drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the director 's craft . Sirk considered himself a ` story bender ' , because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose . Written on the wind is a good example . It wouldn't work in any other hands . The other director that was using similar strategies was Frank Tashlin , who was for 50 's comedy the same that Sirk was for melodrama . Their films are full of the machinery of american life - advertising , TV sets , jukeboxes , washing machines , sport cars , vacuum cleaners - to depict its emptiness and decay . I 'm inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences . The game was played by both sides , so it was camp . Now we regard them as ` cult ' or ` bizarre ' , because we are not those spectators anymore . That is why Todd Haynes 's homage ` Far from heaven ' turns into a pastiche , because it reproduces Sirk 's work nowadays as if nothing happened in between . Then Sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that Julianne Moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned film . Sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly . There were always immovable characters ( Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall here ) against which he could assemble a series of split ones . His balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters , because these are the ones Sirk is interested in too . When Robert Stack flies the plane and ` tempts ' Lauren Bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them ( obvious Faustian echoes ) we are strangely fascinated with him too , as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with Mitch alone by the river . In the Sirk 's universe the studio often-imposed ` happy ends ' have no negative impact . In fact they worked just great . Sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the Deux ex machinea of his day . Thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback , so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the Hadley feud . It was pointed out the many similarities between Written on the Wind with the Godfather saga . I absolutely agree and I 'm sure the parallel is not incidental . Both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family . The temperamental son portrayed by Robert Stack has an amazing physical resemblance with Jimmy Caan 's Sonny Corleone . The action of fighting her sister 's male friend is symmetrical . The non-son in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films , as the fact that both families carry the names of their town . Even details as the gate that gives access to the property , and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves , suggest that Coppola had Written on the Wind in mind while setting his masterwork . Because both films deal with the subject of Power : the acquisition of power , its manipulation and legacy ( even Kyle Hadley 's sterility , the event that hastens the turmoil , is an issue easily tied to the central theme of Power , in this case , a weakness in sexual power ) . The other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is Citizen Kane . One wouldn't think at first of similarities between Welles and Sirk 's films but there are a good many , starting with the petrol business as the origin of the family 's fortune and ending in the fact that Mitch Wayne ( Rock Hudson ) , as Charles Foster Kane , was adopted by a tutor , having his own father alive . Amazingly , the same actor ( Harry Shannon ) perform both Wayne and Kane 's fathers . This detail is cannot be a coincidence . Written on the Wind is a masterpiece in every aspect , in execution and vision , in style and technique , a highlight in the career of this wonderful director . Some say that this is his best film . In my opinion , ` Magnificent obsession ' , ` All that heaven allows ' , ` There 's always tomorrow ' and ` Imitation of life ' are just as good . And for those who put Sirk in the level of Dallas or Dinasty I wish them no happy end .  
0	  I mean , really .. either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie . It 's stupid , ridiculous and just not funny AT ALL . Since i saw the preview i knew it wasn't going to be a great movie , i just didn't think it was gonna be that bad .. What happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie ? When the actors didn't have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny ? . Now we find ourselves with movies like this one , Borat , Little Men , Scary Movie 4 where i could not find the funny parts ! Just skip this piece of garbage P.S. ( sorry for my English )  
1	  The premise to this movie was one which focused on the polarization of of ideologies in the United States .. This was a highly combustible scenario in America whereby two entirely different cultures collided . What justified such heinously depraved actions anyway ? .. As this film presents the scene , ( while Hickock and Smith drank ) these two men were not intoxicated , nor were they under any kind of influence of drugs ! It was a clear cut case of cold and calculated deliberation .. Basically , these violent acts were the end result of emotional and social neglect .. Anytime past 1975 , we as a nation have nurtured an empathy for deviates who have been victimized by their environment .. However , this incident takes place in 1959 ! This dreadful revelation sideswiped us , and mired the nation into a tailspin of conflicting ethics ! With the recent release of the movie " Capote " based on Truman Capote , who was the creator of the documentary " In Cold Blood " , the American people have cultivated a new found fascination with this film ! Robert Blake played the role of Perry Smith , one of the villains in this movie .. This is seemingly appropriate given the notoriety he has been involved with concerning his personal life ! " In Cold Blood " centers on the element of the unexplained .. There was no vengeance involved , there was no material gain to be acquired , there was no potential for social advancement here either , this is merely an instance of a latent and insidiously belligerent anger which ends certainly did not justify the means ! The situational diatribes which Hickock and Smith lamented about were always ambiguous ! Under the circumstances , why then should they take their frustrations out on an anonymously unsuspecting and innocent Kansas family ? .. Will Geer ( Grandpa Walton ) plays the prosecuting attorney who is sickened by this act of macabre capriciousness ! His argument is thoroughly convincing .. His contention being : " These two men who demonstrated no mercy are now asking for yours " This is a line of logic which would induce me to render a verdict of a conviction if I were to be one of the members of the jury ! Absolute disdain for your precarious plight in life does not serve as vindication for orchestrating a capital crime ! It was Capote 's instincts that dictated that such a deranged act of violence should have been brought to the American public 's attention ! As it turn out , it was a harbinger of things to come .. " In Cold Blood " did just that ! This incident was the calm before the storm relating to a pertinent aspect of emergence to the radical 1960 's ! Such a lethal charade also served as an insight to the isolated interests which would besiege many typical Americans for the future ! Truman Capote does a tremendous job on authenticating this savage occurrence with his book , ( which was a best seller ) and , with this documentary as well .. The acting in this film by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson , as well as people like John Forsythe , was incredible ! The director , Richard Brooks , ( " Cat on a Hot Tin Roof " , " Blackboard Jungle " " Elmer Gantry " and " Key Largo " to name but a few ! ) was outstanding in his collaborative efforts in this movie ! I think that " In Cold Blood " is one of the best films in the history of movies ! The film depicts two reprehensible spawns of depravity who delved into demented theatrics , and wound up captivating a trite gratification for being acknowledged at a pejorative nationwide level ! .. This movie pinpoints a psychological discontentment which spurs on an emerging bevy of counter culture purveyors of violence ! Our nation 's ideologies are incredibly different now , than they were in 1959 ! This movie introduces the American people to the emotional and vacillating culprits who initiated such a precarious metamorphosis in our overall value system ! I recommend to everyone that they see this movie .. " In Cold Blood " was the focal point to the film " Capote " ! Think about it , making a movie about a movie constitutes a rare and coveted accolade in Hollywood ! In the case of " In Cold Blood " it is an extreme example of a movie which is vicariously clairvoyant , intellectually elevating , and , of course , it goes without saying , " In Cold Blood " was utterly spellbinding , as well as a totally remarkable movie !  
0	  Criminally Insane 2 is included on the new DVD of Satan 's Black Wedding / Criminally Insane , and it 's a good thing too , because when I 've seen a movie and know there 's a sequel ( especially something that 's as obscure as this ) I 'm always curious . I 've now had my curiosity satisfied and will never watch this again . Most of CI2 is nothing but " flashbacks " to CI , and footage of Ethel asleep , recalling fond memories , I guess . Thanks to Proposition 13 she 's released from Napa State ( wonder if she got to see The Cramps play while she was there ? ) and sent to a halfway house run by a nice old lady that Ethel promptly takes to calling " granny " . This is all filmed with a video camera so the picture and sound are rather pathetic , and it 's even complete with a couple of " rolls " . Of course Ethel does her thing , which is to dispatch anyone between her and food , especially the guy that witnesses one of her acts of mayhem and extorts her dessert . Also , you have to wonder about any halfway house for murderers having a big drawer full of sharp knives in the kitchen and rat poison under the kitchen sink . Guess that 's all a matter of misguided " trust " . If you liked or disliked Criminally Insane , either way there 's no good reason to watch this except out of curiosity . One wonders why the makers of this even bothered . 2 out of 10 .  
0	  The word in the summary sums it up d'oh ;) Five girls get lost trying to find their way home , when they stop at a store to get directions they hit a parked car breaking one headlight on it , they flea the scene in fair of getting in trouble but suddenly they see one headlight coming up behind them ( ooh ) . From there out everything is screaming , crying and violence when they try to get away from this crazy person who lost it because of a headlight ;) , well the screaming and crying pretty much stays through the entire movie ( very annoying ) The movie is shot , with a cheap camera trying to make it seem " real " or " shocking " I guess , it 's just embarrassing and useless though . In lack of anything better to compare it with , " Blair witch style " . The screaming and crying for pretty much the entire movie with crappy sound was over the top annoying , you literally get a headache :) I 'm sorry but this was not scary , only an annoying painful piece of crap movie .  
0	  I bought this movie last weekend at my local Movie Gallery . It was buy 2 get 2 free and I needed one more so I chose this one . Horrible mistake . The box reads like it would be a really good movie . Well , it starts out like it is going to be this great movie . For about 5 minutes , that is . The movie is about a young woman , Laila , who gets killed trying to save her beau , Jack , from a bull . Laila 's dad , Cordobes , is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of . He assumes that Jack killed Laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull , and goes on this hunt to find him . That was the first 5 minutes that is good . What follows after that is only gonna get 100 times worse . Whoever wrote the script , in my opinion , had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever . Jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio DJ named Mary who gives him a ride . I think Mary is supposed to be a virgin Mary type character . You know , Jesus ' mother . But , who knows , I couldn't make heads or tails of it . As they 're running .. we get to see bad guys , magical visions , ghostly encounters , flashbacks , etc .. And all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what 's going on . Needless to say , I took the movie back and exchanged it for something else . It 's horrible I tell ya , horrible . And , there is absolutely no bull-fighting in this movie . Unless you count the first minute of the movie . Hope I helped some other people keep from wasting their time on this movie .  
1	  Excellent story about teenagers , leaders , high school football " stars " . How far will you go to protect your friends ? Lie , kill ? How much can You lose if you stud by an innocent girl ? Can love beat the odds ? Can you defeat narrow-minded small town people ? When your friend scores and you " lose " , will you do everything in your power to make her pay for it , or will you be a man about it , and respect her right to chose ? Will you rape her and show it as your victory over a " problem " girl ? Can you stand by the one who 's only sin is to have an opinion of her own , to be able to make her own decisions , to chose for herself ? It made me think twice before giving my judgment about who was right and who was wrong , but one is for sure - very disturbing movie and theme in general . Thumb up !  
1	  This is a story of two dogs and a cat looking for their way back home . Old and wise Golden Retriever Shadow , young American Bulldog Chance and Himalayan cat Sassy flee from the ranch and go into the wilderness to be reunited with their family . Homeward Bound : The Incredible Journey ( 1993 ) is a family adventure directed by Duwayne Dunham . It 's a remake of a 1963 film . This movie got a sequel three years later . Michael J. Fox is the perfect man to do the voice-over for Chance . Fox has some youthful energy he brings to the role . Sally Field does great voice work as Sassy . Don Ameche is fantastic as Shadow . This was this veteran actor 's second last movie . Also the visible actors are great . Kim Greist plays Laura Burnford-Seaver . Robert Hays is Bob Seaver . Benji Thall plays Peter Burnford . Veronica Lauren is Hope Burnford . Kevin Chevalia is Jamie Seaver . Jean Smart portrays Kate . It 's quite amazing to watch these pets trying to survive in the wilderness . We see Sassy taken by the river and she seems like a goner . The bear scene is exiting and funny . Chance has no chance with that big , hungry bear . And his meeting with the porcupine looks painful . This is some great fun for the whole family .  
0	  I am not a big fan of Rajnikant in the first place , but Baba was a huge disappointment . In between an awful storyline , the action and songs were only mediocre . The storyline becomes very preachy . Instead of running for office like NTR or MGR , Rajni almost appeared to be running as Tamil Nadu 's next big guru . My wife tells me that since this film came out , Rajni swore off doing any more movies ! We were lucky initially to have bought Babu ( an oldie by Sivajiganeshan ) online by accident when trying to buy this one .. that was a great film , which made up for having bought this dud .. except it makes Baba look even worse by comparison !

1	  I loved KOLCHAK : THE NIGHT STALKER since I saw it on the night it premiered on September 13 , 1974 . I loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by Gil Melle ( hey , where 's the soundtrack guys ? ) and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple , important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level . When Darren McGavin 's Carl Kolchak starts to discover odd situations , he reacts like most people would . He finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger , he is frightened , even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode . It 's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force . He 's usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works . Sometimes , he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are . In one episode , he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it , he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly , he must go back and defend himself . He 's heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn't do but that doesn't mean he probably wouldn't much rather someone else did it instead of him . He 's a regular guy , doing a job , trying to make a buck , not a monster-hunter . He just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural , which he has an interest in but he doesn't want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do . If his plan to defeat the creature didn't work , you will often see him running for his life to get away from it , which is of course what I would do in the situation . That 's why I was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid . Kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him . You were scared for him and for the other characters too . The producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit , scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it 's all for naught if you don't care about the characters . Darren McGavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a " monster of the week " show and he decided not to continue . I can tell you I mourned when this show was canceled when I was a kid but , as an adult , I can see why it couldn't go on in that formula for very long . I still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred McGavin as the bumbling , determined and brusk but good-hearted reporter for the INS , known as Carl Kolchak . I seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why I loved the show . It 's not the monsters , darkly-lit sets , creepy music or goofy guest stars , although they are all vital ingredients . The secret to it 's success is right there in the title - " Kolchak : The Night Stalker " . Without McGavin 's lovable , bumbling Carl Kolchak to root for and to care for , then it just ain't a Night Stalker .  
0	  Well I guess I know the answer to that question . For the MONEY ! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie . I admit , I thought the trailers looked bad , but I still had to give it a chance . Well I should have went with my instincts . It was a complete piece Hollywood trash . Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good , must be good . Aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long , it obviously started with a moth eaten script . It 's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor , and awful pastel sceneries . It jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction . This is then compounded with , .. yes I 'll say it , BAD ACTING ! I couldn't help but feel like I was watching " Coffee Talk " on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth . Was the Cat intended to be a middle aged Jewish woman ? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were no prize either , but Mr. Myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he 's ready to make another Austin Powers movie . F- , no stars , 0 on a scale of 1-10 . Save your money !  
0	  This movie is the biggest waste of nine dollars that I 've spent in a very , very long time . If you knew how often I went to the movies you 'd probably say , that 's hard to imagine , but never-the-less , it 's true ! After seeing the trailer for this movie , I knew that I had to see it ! If you 're a fan of horror , mystery , and suspense , why wouldn't you ? The trailer is nothing less than intriguing and exciting ; unfortunately , the movie is none of these . From the cinematography , to the script , to the acting , this movie is a complete flop . If you 're reading this , planning to go to the movie expecting some thrills , mystery , action , horror , or anything other than a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes I 'm afraid you are in for disappointment . " Why is it so bad , " you might be asking yourself . Let me tell you . The movie was neither mysterious nor suspenseful . Nothing about the movie made me the least bit " on edge , " frightened , or curious . The script was at best laughable . There were numerous times throughout the film where the dialogue was just so ridiculous I began to write it off as comic relief only to find out a few seconds later that it wasn't . The acting was absolutely dreadful . I like Nicholas Cage but this was a miss . Without exception , every performance in this movie was incredibly below average . The cinematography was awful with not one moment of suspense or mystique . Finally , the story is completely transparent . You can see the end of this movie coming a mile away . I am not usually a very harsh critic . Frankly , when I go to see a comedy I want to laugh and when I go to see a mystery / suspense / horror , I just want to be surprised . This movie was boring , poorly acted , poorly written , and an overwhelming disappointment . Do yourself a favor and go see something else .  
0	  I love watching Jerry as much as the rest of the world , but this poor excuse for a soft-core porno flick is needlessly offensive , lacks anything resembling wit , and serves merely as a vehicle of self-promotion for Springer . Even though it runs a quick 90 minutes , the film drags hideously , and I should have had the common sense to walk out . Simply atrocious .  
1	  Barbra Streisand 's first television special was simply fantastic ! From her skit as a child to her medley of songs in a high-fashion department store - everything was top-notch ! It was easy to understand how this special received awards . Not muddled down by guest appearances , the focus remained on Barbra thoughout the entire production .  
0	  Live Feed is set in some unnamed Chinese / Japanese Asian district somewhere as five American friends , Sarah ( Ashley Schappert ) , Emily ( Taayla Markell ) , Linda ( Caroline Chojnacki ) , Mike ( Lee Tichon ) & Darren ( Rob Scattergood ) are enjoying a night on the town & taking in the sights . After a scuffle in a bar with a Japanese Triad boss ( Stephen Chang ) they decide to check out a porno theatre , as you would . Inside they are separated & quickly find out that the place belongs to the Triad boss who uses it to torture & kill people for reasons which aren't made clear . Can local boy Miles ( Kevan Ohtsji ) save them ? This Canadian production was co-written , produced & directed by Ryan Nicholson who also gets a prosthetic effects designer credit as well , one has to say that Live Feed is another pretty poor low budget shot on a camcorder type horror film that seems to exist only to cash in on the notoriety & success of Hostel ( 2005 ) & the mini craze for ' torture porn ' as it 's become known . According the IMDb 's ' Trivia ' section for Live Feed writer & director Nicholson wrote it after hearing about certain activities taking place in live sex theatres , for my money I reckon he wrote it after watching Hostel ! The script is pretty poor , there is no basic reason given as to why this porno theatre has a big fat ugly freak dressed in bondage gear lurking around torturing & killing people , none . Was it for the Triads ? Was it for his pleasure ? Was it to make snuff films to sell ? Some sort of explanation would have been nice . Also why did he turn on the Triad boss at the end ? If your looking for a film with a coherent story then forget about Live Feed . It seemed to me to be some sort of uneasy misjudged mix of sex , S & M , horror , torture , gore & action films which doesn't come off . I mean just setting a horror film in a porn theatre isn't automatically going to make your film any good , there still needs to be a decent script & story , right ? The character 's were fairly poor clichés & some of their actions & motivations were more than a little bit questionable . It moves along at a reasonable pace , it 's fairly sleazy mixing gore , sex & nudity but it does look cheap which lessens the effect . Director Nicholson doesn't do anything special here , the editing is choppy & annoying , he seems to think lighting almost every scene with neon lights is a good idea & the film has a cheap look about it . Available in both ' R ' & ' Unrated ' versions I saw the shorter cut ' R ' version which really isn't that gory but I am prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the ' Unrated ' version & say that it might be much , much gorier but I can't say for sure . There 's a fair amount of nudity too if that 's your thing . I wouldn't say there 's much of an atmosphere or many scares here because there isn't & aren't respectively although it does have a sleazy tone in general which is something it has going for it I suppose . Technically Live Feed isn't terribly impressive , the blood looks a little too watery for my liking & entire scenes bathed in annoying neon lights sometimes makes it hard to tell whats happening , it to often looks like it was shot on a hand-held camcorder & the choppy editing at least on the ' R ' rated version is at times an annoying mess . Shot on location in an actual porn theatre somewhere in Vancouver in Canada . The acting is poor , sometimes I couldn't tell if the actresses in this were supposed to be crying or laughing .. Live Feed is not a film I would recommend anyone to rush out & buy or rent , I didn't think much of it with it 's very weak predictable storyline lacking exposition & which goes nowhere , poor acting & less than impressive gore ( at least in the ' R ' rated cut anyway ) . Watch either Hostel films again or instead as they are superior .  
0	  The Broadway musical , " A Chorus Line " is arguably the best musical in theatre . It 's about the experiences of people who live for dance ; the joys they experience , and the sacrifices they make . Each dancer is auditioning for parts in a Broadway chorus line , yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite . The film version , though , captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show , and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical , as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance , whatsoever . The biggest mistake was made in giving the director 's job to Sir Richard Attenborough , whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for " Gandhi . " Why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place ? Which brings us to the next problem . " A Chorus Line " takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes . It 's the least flashy of Broadway musicals , and its simplicity was its glory . However , that doesn't translate well to film , and no one really thought that it would . For that reason , the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers , and should have left the theatre and audition process . The singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet , jazz or tap class . Heck , they could have danced down Broadway in their lively imaginations . Yet , not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film , as Attenborough 's complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction . Many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director ( Michael Douglas ) whether he wants to hear them or not . Douglas ' character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear , and to whom he has no patience . While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play , some heretical changes were made . The very beautiful " Hello Twelve , Hello Thirteen , Hello Love " -a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence-was removed and replaced with the dreadful , " Surprise , " a song so bad that it was nominated for an Oscar . Adding insult to injury , " Surprise " simply retold the same story as " Hello , Love " but without the wit or pathos . There is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what NOT to do when transferring a Broadway show to film . If you want to see a film version of this show , the next closest thing is Bob Fosse 's brilliant " All That Jazz . " While Fosse 's daughter is in " A Chorus Line , " HE is the Fosse who should have been involved , as director . He would have known what to do with this material , which deserved far greater respect than this sad effort .  
0	  Man To Man tries hard to be a good movie : it has its heart at the right place , it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate . But there lies also some of the problems of this picture . It strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged . So it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic - Man To Man doesn't let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head . Joseph Fiennes exemplifies this in his role : he does his best to look concerned , genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer . Add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that Man To Man is not worth watching . But there are enough points to defend it : it is entertaining , has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing Kristin Scott Thomas . Of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like The Elephant Man ( David Lynch ) but you 'll be leaving the theatre satisfied . It tries to grab your heart ( even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious ) and succeeds most of the time .  
1	  La Coda Dello Scorpione ( a . k . a . Case of the Scorpion 's Tail ) was director Sergio Martino 's follow-up to the wonderful giallo Strano vizio della Signora Wardh . This is the quintessential giallo , featuring all the aspects fans of the genre have come to know and love . Twisty plot , beautiful girls , black gloves , sharp blades , and a bit of gore all come together to make one heck of a piece of Italian exploitation . A group of gialli favorites , both in front of and behind the camera , work to make this one of the best non-Argento gialli around . There 's the aforementioned Martino adding his touches as director , giallo great Ernesto Gastaldi as the writer , Bruno Nicolai creating the music , and a host of giallo stars and starlets , such as George Hilton , character actor Luigi Pistilli , and the fetching Anita Strindberg . With all this talent behind it , does Scorpione deliver ? You bet . The film works on many different levels . It 's a thrilling murder mystery , a tense and violent horror film , and a suspenseful thriller . All in all one of the best gialli around . Martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to gialli . At some points in the film , he almost seems to be channeling Argento in his approach . For example , there is a direct rip-off of the scene in Bird With the Crystal Plumage where the killer tries to break through the door , that actually outdoes Argento 's flick . Are there any problems with the flick ? Hmm .. only minor ones . First , any scenes that aren't following the murders or the budding romance between the two leads begin to bore . But just before you fall asleep , the killer will pop out of nowhere and you 'll be right back in the swing of things . Also , towards the end , the twists get a little too bizarre . I mean , what purpose did the scorpion pins really serve ? If you don't play close attention to the dialogue , you could easily become lost with the twisting , weaving storyline . But these minor quibbles aside , La Coda Dello Scorpione is a tense , suspenseful , classy and all around entertaining film for giallo fans . Seek it out !  
0	  I bought this movie because this was Shah rukh khans Debut . And i also liked to see how would he do . I must say he is excellent in his role . Divya Bharathi is superb in this movie . Rishi does a wonderful job . Susham Seth supported well . Alok nath was good in his role . Amrish and Mohnish did their parts well too . Dalip also was good in his small role . Actors shine in a Mediocre movie . The direction is average . The editing is poor . The story is boring . It tells us about Ravi a famous pop singer . He has a lot of female fans . One of them is Kaajal . Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and get married . Ravi gets killed by his cousins . Kaajal becoems a widow .. To escape from Ravis cousins . They go to Bombay . She comes across Raja . She falls in love with him and gets married . Ravi returns . The story is predictable . The climax is predictable . The first half bores . It also drags a lot . But it is saved by the actors and music . The second half entertains . The music is catchy with some nice songs . The cinematography looks outdated in the first half but it looks unimaginative . The song picturisations are dull except for " Sochenge Tumhe Pyar " and one rain song . The costumes are outdated . Any way watch this just for the actors and music Rating-4/10  
0	  Comedy Central has had success with original programming using professional comics . The Chapelle Show , Mind of Mencia , The Daily Show and the hugely popular Colbert Report all star professional comics and all are , or in the case of Chapelle Show , were , solid shows . Given that Sarah Silverman is one of the best female comics in the business , I was expecting good stuff when I tuned in . I was so disappointed . There were some mildly funny sequences , but given that the star is the caliber of Silverman , the show could have been much better . It was just the pilot , and hopefully next week 's show will be better . If not , get her some help in the form of better writers for the show .  
0	  Back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a mercurial , hot-tempered , high-powered Hollywood couple they filmed this ( nearly ) scene-for-scene remake of the 1972 Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw action-thriller about a fugitive twosome . It almost worked the first time because McQueen was such a vital presence on the screen-even stone silent and weary , you could sense his clock ticking , his cagey magnetism . Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen 's league , but he has his charms and is probably a more versatile actor-if so , this is not a showcase for his attributes . Basinger does well and certainly looks good , but James Woods is artificially hammy in a silly mob-magnet role . A sub-plot involving another couple taken hostage by Baldwin 's ex-partner was unbearable in the ' 72 film and plays even worse here . As for the action scenes , they 're pretty old hat , which causes one to wonder : why even remake the original ? * from *  
1	  there should be a sub-genre in the Western called ' the Robert Mitchum Western ' . Mitchum 's brilliant , idiosyncratic , usually undervalued Westerns import his film noir persona to etch some compellingly dark character sketches , and bring an elegiac world-weariness more familiar from the films of Sam Peckinpah . ' Man with the gun ' is one of his best . Directed by Orson Welles protege Richard Wilson , it is a stark , monochrome beauty , full of chilling silhouettes and terrifying outbursts of savage violence , as Mitchum comes to tame a town terrorised by a monopolist with a private army . Mitchum 's regression from soft-spoken stranger to deranged murderer , with a host of dark emotions in between , is a marvel of expressive , physical acting .  
1	  I saw this movie with my friend and we couldnt stop laughing ! i mean there was nothing scary about this movie ! It was funny all the lines Freddy said were hilarious ! I think they shoudln't have even made a new nightmare and just gone to Freddy Vs . jason . Although some parts were gross ( like the head blowing up ) . and any elm street film from 1- 5 sucked . this was the best besides Number 1 . I wouldnt recomend this movie if you want a good horror . But if you have nothing else to do rent this and you 'll laugh alot . I want to see the texas chainsaw massacre I think it would be scary . Freddy 's Dead The Final Nightmare overall grade : B-  
1	  Many neglect that this isn't just a classic due to the fact that it 's the first 3D game , or even the first shoot-'em-up . It 's also one of the first stealth games , one of the only ( and definitely the first ) truly claustrophobic games , and just a pretty well-rounded gaming experience in general . With graphics that are terribly dated today , the game thrusts you into the role of B.J. ( don't even * think * I 'm going to attempt spelling his last name ! ) , an American P.O.W. caught in an underground bunker . You fight and search your way through tunnels in order to achieve different objectives for the six episodes ( but , let 's face it , most of them are just an excuse to hand you a weapon , surround you with Nazis and send you out to waste one of the Nazi leaders ) . The graphics are , as I mentioned before , quite dated and very simple . The least detailed of basically any 3D game released by a professional team of creators . If you can get over that , however ( and some would suggest that this simplicity only adds to the effect the game has on you ) , then you 've got one heck of a good shooter / sneaking game . The game play consists of searching for keys , health and ammo , blasting enemies ( aforementioned Nazis , and a " boss enemy " per chapter ) of varying difficulty ( which , of course , grows as you move further in the game ) , unlocking doors and looking for secret rooms . There is a bonus count after each level is beaten .. it goes by how fast you were ( basically , if you beat the ' par time ' , which is the time it took a tester to go through the same level ; this can be quite fun to try and beat , and with how difficult the levels are to find your way in , they are even challenging after many play-throughs ) , how much Nazi gold ( treasure ) you collected and how many bad guys you killed . Basically , if you got 100 % of any of aforementioned , you get a bonus , helping you reach the coveted high score placings . The game ( mostly , but not always ) allows for two contrastingly different methods of playing .. stealthily or gunning down anything and everything you see . You can either run or walk , and amongst your weapons is also a knife .. running is heard instantly the moment you enter the same room as the guard , as is gunshots . Many guards are found standing with their backs turned to you , meaning that you can walk up behind them and stab them .. nearly silently . In your inventory , you can get no less than four weapons and two keys .. more about the weapons later . The keys unlock certain doors . Most doors in the game aren't locked .. only two kinds need keys , and these keys are only introduced in later levels ( you restart in levels , resetting weaponry , health , score and lives in each chapter ) . Much of the later game is spent looking for them . Now , as I just alluded to , this game , like many of the period ( late 80 's , early 90 's ) , is based on collecting extra lives .. personally , I think it 's completely and utterly useless ( it was mercifully dropped from here on end .. I think ( ? ) , from the next 3D shooter and onwards ) , since you can save anytime you want and ' using a life ' resets weaponry , health and ammo , like starting on a new chapter ( which is a real pain in later levels , where you * need * heavier artillery ) . Now , I shall beat around the bush no longer .. moving on to the guns ! You start with aforementioned knife ( which is silent but only effective up close ) and a pistol .. nothing special , but good for conserving ammo , unlike the next two bad boys . Your third weapon is a German SMG .. a sub-machine-gun . It 's faster and automatic , and some later enemies use it . And the last one .. is nothing short of a Gatling gun ! Oh yeah ! Think T2 . Think Predator . Think about unloading massive amounts of lead into Nazi fiends with such a gun . It 's every bit as entertaining as it sounds . Most of the boss enemies use this , though , so be prepared . I won't reveal the identities of these boss enemies , however .. that 's for each player to discover for him ( or her ) self . The sound is excellent .. very crisp and realistic . As you hear the tear of a machine-gun firing , the deafening metallic clank of a door slamming shut behind you or a Nazi yelling surprised or a warning in German , you truly feel like you are there , trapped in these dark and depressing bunker systems . That segues me nicely into the level design .. as you run through seemingly countless , nearly identical hallways towards the next elevator leading you further , you are grasped by the claustrophobic mood . I almost got motion sickness more than once ( though that might also have something to do with little sleep , lots of humidity and unusual warmth .. ) from playing . Though the level of detail isn't terribly high , what there is is great . Remains of victims , guards ' quarters and countless Nazi symbols .. the list goes on . The game also features quite a bit of gore .. for it 's limited graphics engine , John Romero and crew certainly put in all the blood and guts that they could for the game . What is there left to say .. the first of its kind , and it 's no wonder this spawned countless others 3D shooters . Sure , weapon bobbing and different height levels ( stairs and such ) didn't come around until the next entry into the genre .. Doom .. and it was Duke Nukem 3D that introduced the feature of switching your view ( so it goes beyond simply left and right , adding vertical dimensions to it ) , and jumping didn't come around until a third , later title ( the first Quake , possibly ? Fellow gamers , help me out here ) .. but all of those games , as well as the rest of the genre , owe their existence to this one . So load up the Luger , open the door to enter the bunker and step into B.J. 's shoes .. he deserves the recognition , even ( or maybe even especially ? ) nearly fifteen years after he first appeared . I recommended this to all fans of 3D games . 8/10  
1	  Pinjar is a genuinely good film , with great acting , good narrative , good presentation , touching emotions , etc . It seems to me that the quality of films that Bollywood is producing is quite improving these days , and this film is one evidence . No Bollywood movie that I can remember of made such an impact on me - I was literally thinking about the movie for hours - marvelling at the various emotional situations that test the human in a human . The film rests on the great acting of Urmilla Matondkar , and also some from Manoj Bajpai . Urmilla plays a girl in North India in the background of the partition , and all troubles seem sweet if compared with the problems she happens to face . A must-see film . A technically superior Bollywood product , which I feel is comparable to the best movies coming out of other countries in the world .  
1	  I have found this movie available for streaming on Netflix and thought I 'd give it a try . The plot revolves around Ryan and Theo Taylor ( Colm Feore and David Cubitt ) who have finally seen each other after their father has passed away . Ryan and Theo at first argue about who did what . But later , Theo finds out that his brother Ryan is not only gay but he is dying of a terminal illness . So , Ryan and Theo spend their time patching up their differences . This is such an incredible film . I have only seen Colm Feore in Season 7 of 24 but he was phenomenal in this . David Cubitt , an actor I have NEVER heard of before did a phenomenal job as well . I would recommend this to those who are interested in the Gay and Lesbian genre . This is one movie you don't want to miss . I give this film 10 stars out of 10 . Excellent film !  
0	  Okay like most Steven Seagal fans I know I not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but I do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget . The main problem with the copy I watched was the terrible over dubbing I know that in some films this has to be done and I accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away . Also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it . I was truly disappointed with this film and only hope Stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying / renting . The story of this film had me wondering if I was watching a sci-fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on I found it very confusing .  
0	  Leave it to geniuses like Ventura Pons , the Spanish director , to convince the higher ups in his country to subsidize this misguided attempt of a film . The sad state of the film industry in that country is a product of trying to make a film out of such thin material . Most of the pictures that are made in Spain fall under two categories : those about the Spanish Civil War , that love to present past history as the writers deem fit . The other type of films show the viewer with a lot of gratuitous sex because the ' creators ' don't have anything interest to say . As the film opens we get to watch Pere 's penis as he attempts to cut it off and place it in one of the platters at a party . Later on , Sandra will show all she has been given for the audience to admire . The story of Pere 's attraction to Sandra , a married woman that seems to be happily married , is false from the start . Our only interest in watching the film centered on an earlier , better made picture by Mr. Pons , " Amic / Amat " , but alas , it has nothing to do with the mess we are punished to watch in this venture . As far as the comments submitted in IMDb , all the negative votes come from Spanish viewers , which speaks volumes coming from them !  
0	  I watched this movie with some friends a couple months ago , I still laugh today thinking about some of the utter stupidity . The first few scenes alone were hilarious . I won't spoil anything for those who wish to see it , I wouldn't want to ruin the laughs . Needless to say the entire time I watched this movie I was trying to figure out exactly what the point of anything the characters in this movie were doing . Towards the end we all got bored however , as the initial hilarity and shock of a movie being this random wore off . There is no plot and not a trace of decent acting . The characters are about as well developed as those in a kindergarten " Learn to Read " book . They even managed to make a lesbian sex scene uninteresting .  
0	  I just have to add , in case anyone actually reads this and hasn't completely gotten the point yet . These other reviewers aren't joking around , this really IS the worst colour movie you 're likely to ever see . When the movie started I couldn't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see . They 're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie . It really does . Like the " director " took the family hi8 camcorder ( before DV cameras and computer non-linear editing ) , no other equipment ( lights , sound gear , etc ) , grabbed some decent-looking acting students , and went out to shoot a movie . No script , just making it up as he went along . When I watched it , it was on my mono TV , so I only have one channel of audio ( left of right speaker ) . At first I thought I 'd hooked it up wrong . The movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in . I got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog . They recorded the sound on different bloody channels ! I mean , there 's movies that can be funny to watch , so bad they 're good , kind of thing . I 'm not sure this is one of those . I mean , I 'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker . And seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and PROVE you can do it better , you know . But watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it . As bad as they were , the actors are the only good thing about this . I thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene . A bit of T and A from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4 . But alas , no . If you want to make a movie but it 's turning out crap , throw in some gratuitous nudity . Worked for Roger Corman .  
0	  This is a re-imagining of Tarzan in the era of the Soloflex and Apocalypse Now . There 's nothing inherently wrong with using films eased moral constraints to portray an erotic side to the Tarzan legend . There 's nothing inherently wrong with the premise that Tarzan doesn't speak . There 's plenty wrong with suggesting a woman who could get herself to an African jungle in 1910 , could be this offensively stupid and plastic . Bo has as few lines as possible when bodies are explored because this movie is merely a video-centerfold , as neutral as possible so that you can project yourself and your lecherous fantasies into the project . If it succeeds anywhere it 's in the implication that National Geographic has influenced the way the imagery of a Tarzan movie might be constructed . It would be ridiculous to argue that movies shouldn't employ the sexual tease as ONE of many tools to draw in viewers . Some really great film moments incorporate it . But this move is at the opposite end of the spectrum - the tease is the only thing going on here ; at the time of its release and now . You sit through awful , dumb scenes that offer no interest , and miles of footage of bad acting to drool over the next peek at either of two bodies . Yes .. Bo Derek and Miles O'Keeffe are beautiful ( um , congratulations on having a working libido . ) but if that 's your excuse for giving this schlock a good rating you really should visit a porn store and stock up . There 's only a hairs-breadth difference between the two formats and ( I 'm just guessing here ) a horny viewer would probably really enjoy the latter . The question is whether a mainstream movie is the best venue in the marketplace for viewers to seek out products that satisfy lust alone . As a showman , John Derek successfully capitalized on the sexual mystique developed over wife Bo in the movie " 10 " ; and created a media event out of a shallow project whose only merit was the hotness of the two leads . The movie itself was beside the point . He was about 20 years ahead of his time in thinking audiences would applaud him for making an insipid , shallow movie that was only about showcasing superficiality . As a director , John Derek appears to require only that Mrs. Derek look pleasant , empty and hump-able in every scene . It 's hideously shot . The camera placement is annoying . In terms of editing , the entire ' wipe ' catalog is exhausted . The credit sequence is garish . And it 's a toss-up as to who commits the worse screen offense ; Bo Derek who 's such a bimbo that she can't even figure out how to play a bimbo , or Richard Harris who shouts every line ( as he likes to do ) until you want to shoot him . At least with Bo you can imagine her blaming some horny writer for shortchanging her .  
0	  A chemical spill is turning people into zombies . It 's up to two doctor 's to survive the epidemic . It 's an Andreas Schnaas film so you know what the par for the course will be . Bad acting , horribly awful special effects , and no budget to speak of . The dubbing is ridiculous with a capital R and the saddest thing is that I feel compelled to write one word about this piece of excrement , much less the ten lines mandatory because of the guidelines placed on me by IMDb . My original review of merely one word : Crap wouldn't fly so I have to revise it and go more in to how bad it is . But I don't know if I can , so .. wait I think I may have enough words , or lines rather to make this review pass . Which is cool , I guess . So in summation : This movie sucks balls , don't watch it . My Grade : F  
0	  There will be a time where kids will have grown up without ever seeing the one and only Bugs Bunny kiss ( technically ) another man on the lips . There will be a time where it won't be Duck or Rabbit season . There will be a time where the Tazmanian Devil will be dubbed politically incorrect . But so help me now is not that time . Nobody really wants an ' EXTREME ' version of our beloved Loony characters . Whoever it is in marketing who comes up with " Corn Nuts : Corn gone wrong " and " Extreme Doritos " and evidently this festering turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or whatever doesn't mean they know jack about kids . I think that they 're doing a disservice to children , depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time . This show disgusts me , and it 's not just the dated artwork or terrible dialogue . They misuse good voice talent , like Phil Lamarr , Michael Clarke Duncan , Candi Milo , and so many others . It lacks style , humor , character development , and most importantly , heart . The show , like it 's repackaged characters ( Slam Tasmanian , Rev Runner , Ace Bunny ) is but a shadow of it 's former , timeless and beautiful self .  
1	  I absolutely LOVE this movie and would really like to have it someday . It 's just a fascinating legend about an eagle who wears a Turquoise necklace , I loved it and would like to see it again ! I don't remember too much about it , but that a Native American boy lives in a nice village with his family , and I don't remember what happens , but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone . His sister packs him some food and he goes . While he 's out there , some other Indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him , and he turns into an eagle . The legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace , it is the boy . I was always fascinated with legends , particularly Native American legends and I would love to see this released someday to a DVD , PLEASE RELEASE IT , whoever 's concerned !  
0	  Ursula Andress ' naked body is one of those things that make you believe in God . The other two women ( especially the one who plays the maid ) have great bodies as well . Then why is the higher grade that I can give to a film with such quality and quantity of nudity only 3 out of 10 ? Because , to get to Ursula 's unbelievable body , we have to sit through a movie that is otherwise unfunny and boring ( keep in mind that I watched the full 101-minute version , not the 78-minute American one which probably cuts out a lot of the extraneous material ) . In typical Italian-comedy tradition , most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures ( the army freak , the " latin lover " , the constant drunk , the naive maid ) that are not funny , simply overacted . Final word : watch this , but keep your finger on the fast-forward button , you 're gonna need it . ( *)  
0	  Yikes did this movie blow . The characters were weak , the plot weaker . I figured this couldn't be too bad because it has Christoper Walken , oops . He must have done this because he was bored and needed the money . The characters were supposed to be Irish but noone had an Irish accent . I am desperately trying to find something nice about this , I can't except Walken did a fine job with a wooden character . Find something to read , or watch discovery , don't ever see this movie .  
0	  Undeveloped / unbelievable story line , ( by the time I sort of figured out where it was going , I no longer cared ) bad casting . ( come on .. William Macy as a hit man ? ) bad directing , ( have you ever seen Tracey Ullman perform SO badly ? ) ( Was I supposed to care what happened to the unethical incompetent , uncaring John Ritter character ? ) bad script .. ( Really , I 'm not looking for a formula script but this was really awful ) the only Really good thing in it was the kid . Ten lines ? It 's not OK if your comment is less than ten lines ? COme on - whose rules are those ? Why can't I say what I have to say in less than 10 lines ? Isn't that kind of arbitrary ? Why isn't it OK to have less than 10 lines of comment ?  
1	  A hilarious Action comedy in which Damian Szifron takes into the lives of Díaz , a cop whose wife has cheated on him . He is living in a hotel feeling guilty about his wife 's unfaithfulness , falling into depression he stops caring , running red lights just for fun , feeling sorry for himself . And Silberman , a Jewish shrink on probation , a leftist liberal who does not trust cops at all . He is told to accompany Díaz in his daily duties , unable to refuse due to the terms of his probation . Soon the situation reverts when Silberman himself finds out his wife is cheating on him , and ends up being comforted by the very person he was supposed to help , a person he did not trust at all in the beginning . A nuclear conspiracy , car thieves , international spies , a hysterical wife . Weird characters in a delightful comedy about friendship and heroism .  
1	  Helena Bonham Carter is the center of this movie . She plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity . Kenneth Branagh was tolerable . The movie itself was good not exceptional . If you are a Helena Bonham Carter fan it is worth seeing .  
1	  If you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating . But you just have to realize this movie was not made to please everyone , just people with a sense of humor . For those people the movie is great ! It plays on old Science fiction movies and radio shows long gone , most of witch where B-rated themselves . Along the lines of Spaceballs and Airplane 2 , you may need to stretch your imagination a little bit to get the jokes , but it is well worth it .  
0	  One would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role , to be a funny movie . This is not the case here . I laughed out loud once throughout the whole movie , and that wasn't even during the final comedy-scene ( which one would also expect to be the funniest ) . This is one you can watch when it comes to TV , don't spend any other money renting it .  
0	  I read somewhere that when Kay Francis refused to take a cut in pay , Warner Bros . retaliated by casting her in inferior projects for the remainder of her contract . She decided to take the money . But her career suffered accordingly . That might explain what she was doing in " Comet Over Broadway . " ( Though it doesn't explain why Donald Crisp and Ian Hunter are in it , too . ) " Ludicrous " is the word that others have used for the plot of this film , and that 's right on target . The murder trial . Her seedy vaudeville career . Her success in London . Her final scene with her daughter . No part logically leads to the next part . Also , the sets and costumes looked like B-movie stuff . And her hair ! Turner is showing lots and lots of her movies this month . Watch any OTHER one and you 'll be doing yourself a favor .  
0	  Having read the other comments on this film , I would like to share my own view that this is one tough movie to see unless you are a total Brooksophile . I am not . When looked at by a purely objective observer , the film is an unbalanced narrative that presents us with more undistilled neuroses than are capable of being absorbed in one sitting . It is quite difficult to watch . The Brooks character ( Robert Cole ) is so unsympathetic and unpleasant that it is hard to relate to him-let alone root for him as he stumbles from one dysfunctional self-absorbed situation to the next . And he should NEVER do a topless scene and expect to be taken seriously in a romantic context . No man could have that much exposed foliage and be supposed to turn on a babe like Kathryn Harrold-unless , of course , he is Albert Brooks in an Albert Brooks-controlled production . " Modern Romance " has its amusing moments-but they are fragmentary and infrequent . More often than not , I felt as if I were on a confined journey with a thoroughly dislikable person and wishing that it would end already . It confirms the problems that can develop when too much control of a film is placed in only one person-someone who lacks the self-discipline to be able to step back from it and see what is clearly happening . As most people probably know , James L. Brooks , who played the director in this film , is in fact what he portrayed . Six years later , he cast Albert Brooks in the very successful " Broadcast News . " James showed us how Albert can shape a credible and entertaining comic performance . Albert allowed us to see James ( generally not cast as an actor ) do a rare comic turn in a surprisingly effective manner . Fans of " Modern Romance " will by now have moved on to the next laudatory comment about it . To you I say-there is enough pain in the world without having to find it in a film intended as an entertainment .  
1	  Disney , the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages , has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse . Such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years . Films like " Tarzan " and " The Emperor 's New Groove " have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of Disney 's past and into new , uncharted territory . " Atlantis " is the boldest step yet , but we have to remember : This is STILL Disney . The first ever serious film to come out of Disney 's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it 's so serious it makes it into PG territory . Perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer . But despite the more mature subject matter , this is still a film that Disney wanted to draw in the families with , not just mature audiences , so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand , but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of " The Little Mermaid " et al. So what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot , unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie . Ultimately , this is an action film about Atlantis , not about the exposition preceding it , so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency . Suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point A to point B so quickly , you 're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of Hollywood ! If you want epic levels of detail in the plot , turn to James Cameron 's " Titanic " . Both films feature a boat in some manner . And let 's talk about love , shall we ? Yes , as with a lot of films , the lead male ( one Milo Thatch , a bumbling archaeologist ) and lead female ( Kida , the clichéd Atlantian princess ) are set to fall in love with each other . But what I found was not as clichéd as I was expecting . By film 's end , for once , the characters touching / feeling / kissing sequence was far more subdued . There 's various points in the film where the attraction grows , but it 's just not in the ballpark of , say , " The Little Mermaid " ( A good thing ) . You may have grasped that this is a rather clichéd film . Correct . You have your leading hero and heroine , backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition , all being given their moments during the film . Numerous other characters appear , take up the few minutes of screentime , then disappear . It doesn't take a genius to do the maths  a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals , and with a considerable cast , has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent . So what does it rely on ? Clichés , and lots of them . Every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before . You have the bumbling scientist , the attractive princess , the square-jawed colonel , the rich eccentric , the maniacal sleazebag , the Russian femme fatale  need I go on ? I don't know why this got to anyone  I found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing . Alright , this is meant to be a serious flick , but do you really expect Disney to give up every single trait of their history ? At least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue , and sometimes it even is a little inspired . But in the end it 's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake . The CGI animation is truly amazing in places , and doesn't dwarf the characters , which was a flaw that let the recent " Titan A.E. " down . Speaking of characters , Disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs , bringing an anime style to the film . Infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime , much more so than any previous Disney outing . This resulted in a conflict with fans of the Japanese anime , " Nadia " , for the film 's overall similarities with said cartoon series . Having not seen this anime , I can't comment . With picture , there is sound . Gary Rydstrom heads up the sound team , and what a soundtrack ! From the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat . James Newton Howard treats us to a dynamic musical score , which compliments the film in every way , never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it . Perhaps I missed the point of what the creators intended . To me , the film conveys that it 's an adventure thrill ride , albeit with a more serious tone than any Disney film before it . If you don't like the clichéd tongue-in-cheek attitude , then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight . Heck , at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other Disney efforts ( * cough * Hercules * cough *) . This is a positive , 10 out of 10 review , from someone who was blown away by this film . I always suspend my disbelief with any animated film  after all , the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium . So sit back , enjoy the ride , and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film .  
0	  Ahh this film had so much potential ! A good cast of quality B actors , the thighs of Jessica Simpson and .. that is about it ! I believe some guy in some unnamed marketing department had an idea . Basically , lets do a kind of Legally Blond film , but do it in New York . That big bright city of chances , power and money and where everyone is a heartless , power / money hungry person . Let 's add to this Jessica Simpson , small town bimbo , that brother of Owen Wilson and for some no apparent reason Andy Dick ( only because of him you should ignore this film ) . Basic story line : Boy leaves girl for NY , girl follows , boy cheats , girl stays in NY with cousin , gets a job under false pretenses , mucks up , is courted by other boy ( Brother Wilson ) and together save the day and kiss . a few words come to mind when reflecting upon this film , i.e. dire , awful , unbearable , intolerable and xenophobic Just don't watch this film , you will be happier . One reviewer referred to Guantanamo and i definitely agree with him . This film induces shock . And I know what you are thinking .. at least at some point will I see Simpson naked or close too . It 's not gonna happen , spare yourself the time and YouTube her . You will have better sexy time ! The films editing is flimsy , the acting is unbearable , and why do they use blue screens ? In conclusion ; this is cinematic treason which should be punished to the maximum Another question why does Willie Nelson always play a kind of father figure in almost every Jessica Simpson flick and why are there no black , Latin , Asian or European people in this movie ?  
0	  " Valentine " is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list ( think " Halloween " , " Friday the 13th " , " Scream " , and " I Know What You Did Last Summer " ) . It certainly isn't as good as those movies that I have listed about , but it 's better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first " Friday the 13th " film . One of those films was the 1981 Canadian made " My Bloody Valentine " , which I hated alot . " Valentine " is a better film than that one , but it 's not saying much . The plot : a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film . Then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up , then they 're picked off one-by-one . The killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge . But is it him ? Or could it be somebody else ? " Valentine " has an attractive cast which includes Denise Richards , David Boreanaz , Marley Shelton , Jessica Capshaw , and Katherine Heigl . They do what they can with the material they 've got , but a lackluster script doesn't really do them any justice . There are some scary moments throughout , however . * ( out of four )  
0	  This movie was not very entertaining , certainly NO WHERE as original or as good as A Christmas Story . The characters ( except the youngest ) try to emulate the preceding actors , and they fail . The hillbilly neighbors come out of nowhere as they weren't a part of the first movie . This really sucked , might have been good with the original cast , then again maybe not because the story is so weak . Skip it .  
1	  Geniuses William Cameron Menzies and Herbert George Wells craft this extraordinary anticipation film , with ambition and scope hard to find today . They predict World War II and the way Great Britain was attacked , and also the fact that the war would be followed by a space race . They change the timing ; in the film the war and the space exploration are much longer , but there are so many qualitatively correct things that it 's amazing . We even see an helicopter ( the film is older than them ) . Unforgettable giant planes and a futuristic meritocracy of scientists that seem Romans with bubble-helmets : if you can see through those funny costumes you may appreciate the state of the art architecture by masters from the 30s , Well 's vision of a rationalistic society , interesting reflections on the nature of power , and John Cabal as archetype of the adventurous and inventive human being , the one that chooses to shape reality and not to be shaped by it . 9 1/2 out of 10 . Inspiring like that final monologue by John Cabal .  
0	  Back ( again ) in Scotland , Lassie is ( again ) on trial for her life . Because the faithful dog sleeps on her master 's grave , she must be put to death , according to law . Oddly , it is also explained that Lassie had no " legal " owner , which is , apparently , also against an old Scottish law . If , after three days , no owner is located , dogs must be destroyed . Edmund Gwenn ( as John Traill ) pleads Lassie 's case , which leads to an extended flashback , showing Lassie 's adoption by Donald Crisp ( as John " Jock " Gray ) . Although it 's based on an interesting , original story ( " Greyfriars Bobby " ) , " Challenge to Lassie " revisits several earlier Lassie situations ; and , it does not improve upon them . Comparatively speaking , this one is sloppy and unexciting ; and , it 's a disappointing follow-up to " The Sun Comes Up " ( 1949 ) * . Geraldine Brooks ( as Susan Brown ) and several of the other performers may be charming , but can't elevate this one . Little Jimmy Hawkins ( from " It 's a Wonderful life " ) is among the notable children supporting Lassie ; much later , he will grow up to marry " Dark Shadows " ' bewitching " Angelique " ( Lara Parker ) .  
0	  If there was ever a call to make a bad film that reflected how stupid humanity could become , this one would take the prize . The plot centers around bible prophecies that lie in hidden messages of the scriptures that prompt a group of power-seeking thugs to attempt total control of the world . Just how stupid does this writer believe people to actually be ? The acting was bad at best . Casper Van Dien wasted his talent doing this film . Michael York 's work was a fair match for the role , since he was the center of the film , and did a good job . This plot was sickening and very disturbing . No tender or immature minds should see this film . This is how a basic good vs . evil plot can go astray . There must be a lot of mental disease floating around the film circles , who look for ways to market this type of junk . There must have been something censored out to get a PG-13 rating , but it was still awful .  
1	  When I first saw this movie I was with my dad . He encouraged me to watch this movie because it was one of his favorites . After watching the movie it instantly became one of my favorites . A River Runs Through It is about two brothers who each take a different path in life . Norman Maclean ( Craig Sheffer ) is the older of the two brothers and he is set on the path of education . Paul Maclean ( Brad Pitt ) is the rebellious younger brother who travels on a path full of obstacles . The movie follows these characters as the each follow their own path . There is no downside to this movie . You will be entertained the whole way through . The acting , directing , and script is all perfect . The two things that are exceptional are the cinematography and the score . Both of which entrap you in the world Robert Redford creates for you . This is an all around great movie that is destined to be a classic . It sure is in my book . If you haven't seen this movie definitely watch it as soon as you can because it will stay with you forever .  
0	  I was browsing through Netflix and stumbled upon this movie . Having fond memories of the book as a child , I decided to check this out . This is a movie that you should really pass on . It is just not worth seeing . It is very boring and uninteresting . I feel that it would even be that way to small children . It has no magic that the book contains . This movie is not horrible , but you will just find yourself not caring ten minutes into it . There are moments that just come off as weird . The witch character is not very good . The family acts like it is no big deal that these odd things are happening . I know this is a kids movie , so as an older audience we must not look too deeply in things , but the whole movie just feels like it was written and produced by people who have never had any movie making experience before . The DVD that I had began skipping in the final moments of the film , and instead of trying to fix it I just turned it off and sent it back to Netflix . I really didn't care how it finished . Skip this film and read the book instead .  
1	  After playing a nymphomaniac in WRITTEN ON THE WIND , Dorothy Malone finally said good-bye to her sweet sister / wife roles and demonstrated an ability to play mantraps with the best of them . She and Gloria Grahame played the same sort of tramps-and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role , Malone won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar . The film she 's in is not quite up to Oscar standards , but it is a strong enough melodrama under Douglas Sirk 's capable hands . There 's an almost noirish look to the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story that has ROCK HUDSON , LAUREN BACALL , ROBERT STACK and DOROTHY MALONE as its headliners . Domestic squabbles among the inhabitants of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama , with the accent on the strong supporting players , Stack and Malone . Both of them seize the opportunity with both hands and Stack , too , should have been awarded for his sterling job as the weak , alcoholic brother driven to desperation by his own wild motives . The nominal stars have less impressive work to do , but do it with their usual skill and conviction-Hudson and Bacall . They play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding . The use of color is particularly striking ( as it usually is in a Sirk film ) and yet it doesn't preclude me from thinking of the film as a Technicolor film noir in the vein of LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN . Well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast .  
1	  Words can hardly describe it , so I 'll be brief . " The Thief of Bagdad " was my favorite movie as a child , and it has never ceased to astound or enchant me . I loved this film from the first moment I saw it , when I was a boy of six who had started reading " The Arabian Nights . " I remember walking into the TV room in the middle of Sabu 's battle with the giant spider and being instantly beguiled . Rarely has so much beauty , magic , and wonder been captured on film . Sabu and John Justin are superb as the dashing heros , Conrad Veidt is throughly delightful as the wicked villain Jaffar , and Rex Ingram is a joy to watch as the sardonic genie . Georges Perinal 's photography is some of the best use of Technicolor . One of the three credited directors is Michael Powell , a filmmaker who has been rightfully heralded by the critics but is often overlooked by audiences for his remarkable films , including " A Matter of Life and Death " ( aka " Stairway to Heaven " ) and " The Red Shoes . " He is one of the true masters of the camera , right up there with David Lean , Akira Kurosawa , and Orson Welles . As with all great works of art , the beauty of " The Thief of Bagdad " lies in the detail . Every frame has its own magical charm . The story never lags , and the characters and their actions are always involving . Here is a film that will never grow old .  
1	  Recently , a friend and I were discussing educational and ethical influences when we were growing up in the 1950 's versus today . She mentioned Samuel Taylor Coleridge , who , in 1798 , wrote The Rime of The Ancient Mariner . Both of us had been required to recite parts of the epic poem in high school and in English Literature courses in college . My friend said , " Its messages even might be called metaphysical within today 's context . " We tried reciting it and only remembered bits and pieces . ( I have problems remembering Dr. Seuss . ) I said I 'd get two copies of the poem so each could read it . That was easy enough , but I was extremely surprised to find it had been made into a film . We looked forward to watching the film to see how it had been interpreted . After all , The Rime of the Ancient Mariner isn't exactly light reading . After each had read the poem , we watched the film together . We considered the film a remarkable achievement , especially considering it was made in the 1970 's , before computers , before the so-called " Ken Burns effect , " and before special effects too often began compensating for a lack of substance . Particularly noteworthy are the 19th and 20th century illustrations culled from " lesser known artists , " such as Willy Pogany , the early Hollywood designer . The film is narrated by Sir Michael Redgrave , whom had taught the poem when he was a schoolmaster , adding a tone of authority and credibility in remaining true to the poem . Its mastery is in the layers of subtle messages , conveyed without " instructing , " or becoming an oppressive and obvious morality tale . We found it such a refreshing change from today 's ' in your face ' and ' clobber them over the head ' mentality . Most of today 's morality messages in film are two-dimensional : extreme violence , murder and mayhem mark the bad . The bad are really , really , bad , and good are super heroes . It is as if human character lacked any nuance . The Rime of The Ancient Mariner is a celebration of the individual , of character , of an appreciation for celebrating all the richness life has to offer , within the larger context of humanity , i.e. , man 's capacity to give to others . Proud of ourselves for having found this " unknown " gem , we then learned it had won the top award in its category five out of six times at " name " international film festivals . Another surprise was learning the film 's director , Raul daSilva , is a recognized authority on early animation , and authored six award winning books about film . This film 's message is just as relevant today , if not more so , than when Coleridge penned the original epic poem and when Raul daSilva translated it to film . If I still was teaching high school , which I did for five years , I 'd grab this one and show it to all my students . There 's a level of richness here that naturally leads to discussion about the big and important issues all of us face , whether in 1798 , 1978 , or today-in fact , as long as humanity has a spiritual component . Highly recommended .  
1	  Colman 's performance is aided by the brilliantly written script . The gargantuan Hollywood studios in the 30 's and 40 's were able to copy some of the German expressionistic film elements and incorporate them into Hollywood films . very good use of shadows and light and silhouette . i really liked the scene where colman turns off the light in his dressing room near the beginning of the film , and he starts reciting Othello while his face becomes instantly dark and evil . already the viewer sees the text and the drama of Shakespeare getting a hold of " Tony " and off he goes on his journey of doom . i also enjoyed the dramatic death scene within the play , when he becomes overwrought with emotion and accidentally strangles his costar a little too hard for her to bear . her pleadings " tony stop you 're hurting me " are chilling and suspenseful . you just don't know if he is going to go over the top and kill her at any moment . the cat and mouse chase to reveal the killer was nicely added 2/3rds of the way through the film to add some faster pacing and to also add to the narrative element of the film . Masterful work from George Cukor . He 's such as skillful director . Excellent film . Too bad they don't make ' em like they used to ..  
0	  Drew Barrymore plays young Holly Gooding , who moves in with aspiring hack screenwriter Patrick Highsmith ( George Newbern ) and completely disrupts his life by claiming that her " doppelganger " , or evil twin , is out to kill her and her family . This silly horror film is kind of hard to take seriously , even if the film-makers and actors themselves seem to be dead serious . " Doppelganger " is muddled , with some unpleasantly dumb dialog . Some viewers will note that Drew 's character 's name is drawn from Audrey Hepburn 's role in " Breakfast at Tiffany 's " , and that Newbern 's character 's name is a play on the name of famed author Patricia Highsmith ( he is actually trying to re-write " Breakfast " as a horror film , believe it or not ! ) . I suppose that it deserves some credit for not being quite your typical horror film - I mean , writer / director Avi Nesher seems to genuinely care for his characters , and gives his film more plot than standard slasher fare . After a silly villain explains everything to the audience confrontation , the film goes on to submit a hideous , out-there climax that has to be seen to be believed . This film certainly does not skimp on the gore . But hey ! Drew kills her mother in this one . No , I 'm not joking . Jaid Barrymore shows up near the beginning only to get violently slaughtered . Drew is always very watchable , and very sexy in this one . Newbern comes off as a likable-enough , " nice " sort of guy . But the highpoint of the film has to be the scene with Sally Kellerman , an attractive veteran who 's very professional in her one scene as a former nun who 's started a phone sex business ( ! ) . The film is basically junk but fairly amusing on a sleazy , sordid little level . 4/10  
1	  I loved this movie for two reasons : 1 ) Jeff Combs is absolutely wonderful in it . Plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt . ( And is absolutely adorable . ) 2 ) The movie helped to inspire a role-playing game I thoroughly enjoy , Mage : The Awakening . I 've shown it at various LARP after-parties , and it 's always a big hit . D & D love and Jeff-squeeing aside , it 's not exactly a masterpiece , but it 's well-done and thoroughly enjoyable . The plot is fast-moving and engaging in its simplicity , the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget , and the script , while nothing stellar , was not too badly done , and cheesy in all the right places . A good way to spend an evening .  
1	  Most people miss Hollywood 's point of concept . If a hero can stimulate heroic deeds to the mind of a child , within the confines of the law then I , approve of the lessons being taught by Doc Savage . In all times of conflict or war , the public and government look for heroes to decorate . The motion picture industry brings heroes to the screen for people to identify with - such as Doc Savage , James Bond , Superman , Batman , Spiderman and others . Doc Savage is remembered by more than one generation as being the ' best of the best ' before James Bond , Superman or any of the others . All others that follow Doc Savage are only a part of the character , not the ' Man of Bronze ' .  
0	  What an incomprehensible mess of a movie . Something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom ( and from the size of the jar he 's been shot about fifty times by now ) and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into Mexico . Whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear . And you 'll never hear another screenplay feature the word " butthorn " either . Gary Busey tries out the Mel Gibson role from " Lethal Weapon " and while Busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity . William Smith does another turn as a Russian soldier , the same character he played in " Red Dawn " a few years earlier . After playing biker heavies for most of the 70s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing Communist heavies . Sadly he 'll probably always be remembered best as the guy who Clint Eastwood whupped in " Every Which Way You Can . "  
0	  Expectations were somewhat high for me when I went to see this movie , after all I thought Steve Carell could do no wrong coming off of great movies like Anchorman , The 40 Year-Old Virgin , and Little Miss Sunshine . Boy , was I wrong . I 'll start with what is right with this movie : at certain points Steve Carell is allowed to be Steve Carell . There are a handful of moments in the film that made me laugh , and it 's due almost entirely to him being given the wiggle-room to do his thing . He 's an undoubtedly talented individual , and it 's a shame that he signed on to what turned out to be , in my opinion , a total train-wreck . With that out of the way , I 'll discuss what went horrifyingly wrong . The film begins with Dan Burns , a widower with three girls who is being considered for a nationally syndicated advice column . He prepares his girls for a family reunion , where his extended relatives gather for some time with each other . The family is high atop the list of things that make this an awful movie . No family behaves like this . It 's almost as if they 've been transported from Pleasantville or Leave it to Beaver . They are a caricature of what we think a family is when we 're 7 . It reaches the point where they become obnoxious and simply frustrating . Touch football , crossword puzzle competitions , family bowling , and talent shows ARE NOT HOW ACTUAL PEOPLE BEHAVE . It 's almost sickening . Another big flaw is the woman Carell is supposed to be falling for . Observing her in her first scene with Steve Carell is like watching a stroke victim trying to be rehabilitated . What I imagine is supposed to be unique and original in this woman comes off as mildly retarded . It makes me think that this movie is taking place on another planet . I left the theater wondering what I just saw . After thinking further , I don't think it was much .  
1	  I am normally not compelled to write a review for a film , but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair , so I feel it necessary to share my point of view . " Krisana " ( or as it was titled at the theater I saw it , " Fallen " ) follows Matiss , a lonely Latvian archivist , as he tries to learn about a woman whom he didn't try to stop from jumping off a bridge , as well as her reasons for doing so . That 's the plot in a nutshell , but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act . As a detective who investigates the incident tells him , we usually don't bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they die . Comparisons to Michaelango Antonioni and his " Blowup " will most likely abound in any review you read about " Krisana . " The influence of Antonioni 's philosophical and austere style and the story of " Blowup " are clear and , in fact , writer / director Fred Kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which Matiss attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge , or at least who he thinks did . The only other person to share his or her views on the film detracts the " college film class " look and sound of the film . He or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints that an existentialist Latvian film most likely faces , but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and ambient sound succeeds at an artistic level to depict the solitude of Matiss . The background sound of wind and street noises lend an ominous aura and reminds one of a Fellini film , whether or not that was Kelemen 's intention . The filmmakers undoubtedly had little money , but this constraint is used to the film 's advantage . " Krisana " succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self-serious . It could have easily fell into the trappings of a mystery story , but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt . If you are more concerned with plot , this film and its ending may frustrate you . Otherwise , take the time to be engaged by it . It is well-worth seeking out .  
1	  It 's a good show , and I find it funny . Finally the bad Latin stereo types are over ! ¡Gracias , Señor Lopez ! I love this show , and I just started watching it about three months ago . The whole concept about a Latin family TV show really amazed me . I am surprised that finally Latinos have a good shot to be on TV . This show is probably one the best I 've seen , it 's funny , heartwarming , touchy , and nice .  
1	  Filmed by MGM on the same sets as the English version , but in German , Garbo 's second portrayal of " Anna Christie " benefited from practice and her apparent ease with German dialog . Garbo appears more relaxed and natural under Jacques Feyder 's direction than under Clarence Brown 's , and her silent movie mannerisms have all but disappeared , which made her transition to sound complete . The strength she brought to the character remains here , although it has been softened , and Garbo reveals more of Anna 's vulnerability . The entire cast , with the exception of Garbo , is different from the previous version of the film , and Garbo benefits from not having to compete with Marie Dressler , who stole every scene she was in during the English-language version . In Feyder 's film , Garbo holds the center of attention throughout , although the three supporting players , particularly the father , gave excellent performances . Feyder 's direction was more assured than Clarence Brown 's , and his use of the camera and editing techniques did not seem as constrained by the new sound process as did those of Brown . The film moves with more fluidity than the English language adaptation , and the static nature of the first film has been replaced with a flow that maintains viewer interest . Even William Daniels cinematography seems improved over his filming of the Brown version . He captured Garbo 's luminescence and the atmospherics of the docks with style . Also , the screenplay adaptation for the European audience made Anna 's profession quite clear from the start , and the explicitness clarifies for viewers who were unfamiliar with the play as to what was only implied in the Brown filming . However , the film was made before the Production Code was introduced , which made the censorship puzzling . Garbo 's Oscar nomination for " Anna Christie " was always somewhat mystifying , and I suspected that the nod was given more in recognition of her relatively smooth transition to sound films than for her performance . However , some of the Academy voters may have seen the German-language version of the film , and they realized , as will contemporary viewers , that her " Anna Christie " under Feyder 's direction was definitely Oscar worthy .  
0	  " Nacho Libre " ( 2006 ) Directed By : Jared Hess Starring : Jack Black , Ana de la Reguera , Héctor Jiménez , & Darius Rose MPAA Rating : " PG-13 " ( for some rough action , and crude humor including dialog ) Say what you will about it ( I know some people who despise it to no end ) , but I have always thought that " Napoleon Dynamite " was a funny movie-not the brightest brick on the wall , but a funny movie , nonetheless . Jack Black is also a very funny man-irritating at times , yes , and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him , but funny . There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some degree . So , I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess , the writer and director of " Napoleon Dynamite " , and Jack Black would be teaming up for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage . My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin . Unfortunately , my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie . This plot , had it been done as a skit on some such show as " Saturday Night Live " or possibly even " Mad TV " , would have worked flawlessly . Unfortunately , the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy falls flat . Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord . Feeling shunned by the entire monastery , Nacho ( Black ) , now the monastery 's cook , decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler . As the monastery 's finances hit an all-time low , Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery 's orphanage . This plot sounds so sweet and caring . It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black . Look what he did with " School of Rock " after all . Well , to my displeasure , this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie . It is again Hollywood 's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorof course , for all I know , maybe that is the general thought of teenagers , as many seemed to enjoy this movie . Watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh , but don't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie . A seven-year-old could make up the same joke . The performances in " Nacho Libre " are actually good . Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic , worthless lines in ever put on paper comical . Unfortunately , this movie just wasn't enough for him . It didn't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him . I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before , but now I can say that , not only is she quite talented , but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight . She just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well . Héctor Jiménez , who plays Nacho 's bumbling partner , Esqueleto , kept me laughing continuously . He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Black 's . Darius Rose , who plays an orphan named Chancho , didn't have many lines , but , what can I say , I just enjoyed him . He was adorable . The rest of the cast did their job . It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie . " Nacho Libre " just does not work . Its plot is stretched far too thin . The heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don't work . I very rarely laughed and , if I did , it was because of Jack Black or another member of the cast . And that leads me to the bright side of " Nacho Libre " : yes , the cast . This cast was justwell , for lack of a better word , they were on . They all clicked , had excellent chemistry together , and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script . After Jared Hess 's " Napoleon Dynamite " kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie , I was surprised to find myself so often bored with " Nacho Libre " . Something was lost here and I have yet to understand what it was . All I know is that " Nacho Libre " is not a good movie and yet , because of its cast , it is completely worthless . There is a small reason to watch , if only to watch Jack Black work . But , if you are not a fan of Jack Black , then avoid this movie like the plague . I like Black , but I am done with this movie and with this review . Final Thought : Yikes ! This is Jared Hess 's surprisingly disappointing follow-up to his hysterical " Napoleon Dynamite " . Overall Rating : 4/10 ( C + )  
0	  This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it . It 's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen - each one with no apparent connection to the next . I rented this movie because I 'm a David Bowie fan , and I really appreciate musicals . In finality , Bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired . The moral of the story was really befuddling . I couldn't tell if it was about racial issues in London in the 1950s or about not selling out . For the first half of the movie I was chuckling at how cheesy it was but I liked the campiness of the " no selling out " message . When blacks started being murdered I thought my tape had gotten messed up . Maybe I rented half of two different movies ? Nope , there was a " Keep Britain White " song and dance sequence . I 'm sorry , but WWII is not something you can write a musical about . At least not a musical that could conceivably be described as " campy " as I have several times in this review . Overall I 'd say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors . ( And put David Bowie in it for longer goddammit ! ) My grade : C-  
0	  Quote : theurgist : Anyone with an I.Q. over 50 would have seen this film what it is , an intelligent well acted prequel to a modern day classic , yes it doesn't have a blockbuster cast or a huge budget BUT it is still very well done and had me hooked for the full duration . An I.Q. over 50 you say .. that most mean you have an I.Q. lower than 50 .. its name is CARLITOS WAY : Rise to power ! meaning it should have something whit the first one to do .. all and all its a OK movie if .. YOU CHANGE THE TITLE AND NO CHARACTERS NAMED CARLITO BRIGANTE ! P. s don't comment on a movie if you don't know anything about movies . but i guess an I.Q. under 50 , you wont know what the hell i am yelling about .. Peace out !  
0	  I just watched this movie on Starz . Let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved ; the acting , writing , directing , special effects , camera crew , sound , and lighting . It also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie . Apparently back in 2007 , when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $ 75 million . Now-a-days those things cost about $ 3 billion and they cant go invisible . Apparently you can fly from the US to the middle east in an hour . There was a completely random lesbian scene , which I didn't mind , but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it . The camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes . Oh yeah , since its a Steven Segal movie , its predictable as hell . All in all I rank it right up there with Snakes on a Plane .  
0	  Now I had the best intentions when watching this one . I like some of Tony Scott 's work , also a friend of mine told me it was a great movie , even though I heard otherwise from other people . But this was simply hopeless . In my humble opinion , Tony Scott was trying too hard . It was all just too much . Allow me to elaborate . Miss Knightley was overacting , and not in a good way . The people who did perform well , were Mickey Rourke , Edgar Ramirez , and Christopher Walken , but their screen time just wasn't able to save the movie . There were a few scenes that jumped out in their originality , yet somehow it felt like they were written by someone other than the main writer . A certain tune was used around 4 times , which really started to bug after the second time . I 'm a firm believer of not using the same tune more than once . Also , the editing really went out on this one , as the cutting rate is rather high . Oh , and the repetitive echoing of some of Keira 's lines simply sounded cheesy after hearing it for the second , third , fourth time , and so on . Basically , my opinion is that if you want to see an action-flick that is high-paced and " somewhat " funny , and you don't care about everything I mentioned above , you might like it . ( On a side note : I 'm not a Keira Knightley fan . )  
0	  If there was a God , he would have made sure this movie stayed in the toilet were it was crapped up . This is BY FAR the worst vampire movie I have ever seen . I may never watch a vampire film again because of this movie . It makes Zombie Lake look like The Sound of Music .  
1	  I rented this movie from blockbuster on a whim .. i like alan arkin and the cover was catching .. i read the back and knew right away it was going to either be the best or the worst movie i have ever seen .. i guess i got lucky .. i laughed from beginning to end .. alan arkin brings a great character to this movie . i have since bought a used rental copy for my own collection and watch it all the time .. i have recommeded this movie to loads of people and they all enjoyed it as much as i did .. i see complaints about the menus and dvd functions .. but it doesn't take away from the movie .. the disk was authored for Blockbuster exculsivley which is why they didn't allow you to skip past the previews .. aside from that you shouldn't let the functions of the DVD to deterr you from watching the excellent film .  
1	  I must confess to not having read the original M R James story although I have read many of his other supernatural tales . I 've also seen most of the previous BBC Christmas Ghost Stories and this one , in my opinion , surpasses most of them , only equalling The Signalman . I can't really fault A View From a Hill - the direction and ' mood ' is perfect , as is the acting , lighting and , of course , the story and writing . I thoroughly enjoyed this and can only hope for more of this quality from the same director and production team . I understand that the BBC plan to make some more ( not necessarily based on M R James stories ) so that 's promising . 10/10  
1	  City Hall takes on the politics of a city rather than country , state or any sort of major political table . Granted it shines on New York City which is a huge political arena , especially nowadays , but it still goes for a smaller scale and puts the microscope on a few key players in a city wide scandal stumbled on by the mayor 's right hand . Director Harold Becker is a director very familiar with elements of the thriller having done Mercury Rising , Malice , and Domestic Disturbance and I think in many ways he incorporates so many of the formulaic thriller genre that its almost to a fault . I mean City Hall is meant to be a political drama , not a thriller but instead when all is said and done and once you get to the meat and potatoes of the film it feels and looks like a thriller but a decent one at that with very important part of the recipe that immediately makes it stand out .. what else .. or rather who else .. Al Pacino . The film begins by giving you a really good look at life in the mayoral office and the inner workings of the city . As the film continues it broadens its political spectrum to include a democratic boss , and his connections and then we are introduced to some of the goings on within the city . As events unfold a mystery begins and the political aspect is kind of left in the background but it still has a brilliant set up . I absolutely hate talking about Al Pacino . I mean even if ONCE he didn't give a good performance how could I ever say it ? The man is acting royalty . There is just something brilliant about his entire demeanor . In City Hall Pacino plays the New York City mayor . He has a sense of duty and honor and immediately appears to be a very upstanding politician . He also delivers one of the most powerful and outright engaging speeches I 've ever seen at the ' James Bone ' Funeral . I re-watched that speech four times and the first time I watched Pacino give it , my mouth gaped open and I almost wanted to stand up and applaud . Its brilliantly written and brilliantly delivered by Pacino . John Cusack , who I really do enjoy as an actor , turns in a mediocre and overdone performance as the deputy Mayor Kevin Calhoun . He is kind of the focus of the film and him and Pacino have good chemistry together when they are on screen but there is just something in this performance .. he seems like he 's trying too hard . His accent is just bizarre , and although he is supposed to be cutthroat and intimidating he doesn't get seem to pull it off . Maybe he was having an off film . Bridget Fonda , on her way out of her high point stardom does an okay job as attorney for police widows Marybeth Cogan . Her performance is very similar to Cusack 's in that she just doesn't seem to find her groove with this character . Danny Aiello is terrific although his character is a little under explored as democratic boss with ties to the mafia Frank Anselmo . Martin Landau makes a decent cameo as Judge under scrutiny Walter Stern . The problem with City Hall is evident in my review of the characters and actors . Everyone is .. okay . There is a lot of back story that they try to bring out without actually showing it and it unfortunately leaves you just a little bit confused about the whole conspiracy . And of course you have Al Pacino in a rather small supporting role but he 's absolutely brilliant at it and outshines and overshadows every other actor in the film . It almost feels like maybe they are intimidated by him being on screen with them . So City Hall could have been this huge political epic drama / thriller but it felt cut and toned down to an average run of the mill one BUT it still has to be seen for Pacino and a different spin on the inner working of politics . If you just won't see this movie than find Pacino 's speech at James Bone funeral because the word electrifying doesn't seem to give it justice but you can see what makes Al Pacino so incredible because in a mediocre film he pulls out this wallop of a speech and makes you feel it . If you 're a John Cusack fan which I am .. he 's definitely done better but he is the main character and all in all he does get his justice . A decent movie but unfortunately potential loss . 7.5/10  
0	  Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again . If he does he should be arrested on the spot .. at the very least for petty larceny . Anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated . This was innocently my first viewing of his " work " .. and it will my last . Ed Wood looks awfully good to me right now . When I return this piece of crap to the video store , I will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf . An active supporter of gay cinema , I am incensed and angered that this warped , exceedingly untalented man-child be allowed to distribute and package something like this , with a coltish pretty boy on the cover ( Jamie Brett Gabel , who , thankfully , has no other acting credits in IMDb ) and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait , and then market it as a " movie " rental . Trust me , this has no place being on any rack anywhere ; it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word . Offensive , irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema ( hell , gay rights in general ! ) For those tempting to rent this out because of the cover , you WILL be disappointed . Gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover , and he appears once or twice without a shirt - that 's it . Instead , the homely Mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting , sorry-looking dough-boy nakedness . This " thing " he " assembled " is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich . Both he and his friend Michael Habousch ( who , I understand , puts out similar sleazy garbage ) are terrible in this . Mraovich is purposely posing as a complete no-talent ( in all fields ) , desperate to grab onto any " loser " attention he can for himself . He is to be pitied .  
1	  I love this show . Period . I haven't been watching very long , probably only about six months or so , actually , but it is now my favorite show and probably will be for quite a while . I love all of the characters , except I don't really care for Donna . I 'm not completely sure why . I just .. don't find her funny , and I don't think Laura Prepon is a very good actress . Other than her , I find the rest of the cast pretty good . Kurtwood Smith and Debra Joe Rupp , who played Erics parents , were extremely funny . Topher Grace is also a great actor . Unlike a lot of fans , I did not completely hate the 8th season . I still watch it , and it does make me laugh . But , if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons , its .. not good . Randy is horrible . The finale was decent , nothing amazing , but good . =] I do think it would have been better to cancel the show after Ashton and Topher decided to leave , but oh well . I have the fourth season on DVD , and someday I hope to have all eight seasons on DVD . Some of its most hilarious episodes , in my opinion , were ' Dine & Dash ' , ' Grandmas Dead ' , ' Red & Stacey ' , and ' Streaking ' , but I love every episode I 've seen so far , which is most of them , I think . =] 9/10 stars , I would definitely recommend it . =]  
0	  Now , i hired this movie because Brad Dourif was in it . He is an excellent actor , BRILLIANT in everything .. except this movie . And i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was , and didn't bother with a good performance . This movie is a unintentional-comedy . Some of the lines just crack me up . And them there are some lines that make no sense , and it seems like Tobe Hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot . Oh ! BTW the plot is BAD ! But it one of those films that is TAHT BAD that its actually PAINFUL to watch . I recommend this only for BIG Brad Dourif fans , or fans of any of the other actors , because the plot is pathetic .  
1	  Add Paulie the parrot to beloved movie animal characters . This movie is a love story - bird and Gena Rowlands , Bird and beloved Marie , Michael and Marie . A Russian janitor helps a talking and thinking parrot find his rightful owner many years after Marie 's parents sell him to a pawn shop . Before the heart warming ending we learn all the misadventures of Paulie . Cheech Marin and his dancing parrots are marvelous . Beautiful photography throughout . Great little movie , word of mouth will make it a cult favorite .  
1	  STAR RATING : * Unmissable * Very Good * Okay * You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All Costs Stuck-up career bitch Kate ( Franka Potente ) heads to the London underground to catch a train to take her to meet George Clooney . However , after a hectic working day , she dozes off and awakens to find herself alone in a deserted platform . As she races off on a situation taking her from one daunting encounter to the next , however , she learns of something far more malign and evil waiting for her out there . In a lot of ways , the British Film Industry is really becoming one on it 's own , especially in the horror thriller department , with films such as Creep and the successful 28 Days Later ( which this has strong echoes of in parts . ) In terms of succeeding in what it set out to do , Creep does cleverly create ( especially at the beginning ) a scary sense of isolation and tense fear . At it 's clever running time , it also ( though inadvertently , I suspect ) manages to pay homage to some of those pioneer high-concept horror films from the 70s that rely on shocks and fear through-out without really focusing too much on character development and such . Of it 's weaknesses , some scenes are a little predictable , but these don't really succeed in making it less scary or effective in any way . I 'm not sure if the ending was meant to make it come off as some sort of morality play and it 's not exactly perfect , but it 's certainly very effective and serves it 's basic function very well . *  
1	  I went into this expecting not to like it ; I figured it would be terribly worthy and earnest , and rather plodding and dull . It 's actually far better than that , and I found myself really enjoying it . I don't know too much about Queen Victoria beyond what most know - married to Albert , who died young , and she mourned him ever after . Seeing the circumstances she grew up under was fascinating ; in fact I found myself wishing I 'd seen more of the story , and I imagine we may see a sequel at some point . Visually the film is stunning . The sets and costumes are incredibly lavish without being too gaudy and over the top . The acting is top notch from everybody involved . In a word , it was great !  
0	  I was not expecting much going in to this , but still came away disappointed . This was my least favorite Halestorm production I have seen . I thought it was supposed to be a comedy , but I only snickered at 3 or 4 jokes . Is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over ? What was up with the janitor in Heaven scene ? Fred Willard has been hilarious with some of his Christopher Guest collaborations , but this did not work . They must have spent all the budget on getting " known " actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget . It looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark . Does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket , as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket ? I try not to be too critical of low budget comedies , but if you want to see something funny go to a real Church basketball game instead of this movie .  
1	  A somewhat typical bit of filmmaking from this era . Obviously , It was first conceived into this world for the stage , but nonetheless a very good film from beginning to end . Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to do their stage performance act for the silver screen and both do it effectively . There is very little in the way of story and anyone not familiar with this type of off beat character study may be a little put off by it . All in all , though , A good film in which Peter O'Toole and Susannah York get to overact .  
1	  I enjoyed this movie . Haven't seen Andy Griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly . I 've associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he 's versatile . I wasn't troubled that Dotty 's " anxiety disorder " may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook . There are zillions of whatever-phobias and neuroses , and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms . She is clearly a sensitive with extra-sensory powers as was understood by the local Indians but not by any Anglos . It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric . Although this is taken to be a light " family movie " , it is actually more sophisticated than it seems . Also , Hiram 's twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle . It 's fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance .  
0	  A surprising misfire from the usually reliable Larry Cohen ( God Told Me Too , Q , etc . ) , Full Moon High tries so hard to be funny and fails miserably , even with decent turns by Ed McMahon ( ! ) and Kenneth Mars . Alan Arkin looks embarrassed throughout his performance and son Adam simply looks numb . This makes Teen Wolf look like a comedy classic .  
0	  Hard to describe this one - if you were a fan of Russ Meyer films back in the day , you will surely be pleased to see that Haji is still looking really hot , though Forry Ackerman has not fared so well ( what is he doing still making these movies anyway ? If I go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie ? ) . It was a pretty fun premise - a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon - but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length , and the jokes were on a level with your average Joe E. Brown comedy ( or , Abbott and Costello if that 's your thing ) - basically just bad puns . Still , I found this movie fascinating to watch , and for more than 2 reasons . Good job , but still a fundamentally flimsy production .  
1	  This excellent series , narrated by Laurence Olivier , brilliantly , it should be said , charts the beginning to the end of World War 2 . The origins are not entirely examined fully from Germany 's fall at the hands of the Versailles treaty which helped propel Hitler 's demonic rise , but as one reviewer says , that must be hard to do , in a 26-part series with so much to cram in . Apart from the expected combat photography / action , there are plenty of personal , emotional and human tragedies that are told giving the viewer an amazing insight , especially if you 're not necessarily a World War 2 buff / fan . Episodes showing ' testimonies ' and what life was like on the home front of the main allies / adversary , Britain , Germany , Japan , Russia and the U.S.A. were quite eye-opening . Showing the extreme savagery of the war on the frontline and of course the sufferings of civilians , the death camps etc . , were very well handled and exposed . I 'd fully recommend this in any history class for the younger generation ( Of which it could be said I am one at 47 ! ) . Certain things are quite strangely left out , like the advent of the new jet era beginning , with Frank Whittle 's experimental Gloster jet and the Gloster Meteor 's combat debut as well as that of the German Messerschmitt Me 262 - especially as the V-1 was seen making its debut and there was surprisingly smaller mention of the V2 . This is probably a small oversight , not referring to the more sensational secret and fantastic weapons which WW2 brought forward from a more barren old science . But a great series that made its mark and has done so ever since when thankfully repeated . A series to own as a box set in history terms , on DVD for anyone especially who happens to be a military fan . Jeremy Isaacs and Thames TV should be well proud .  
1	  I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed this most thoughtfully delivered drama , which owing to its rather unimpressive 6.6 rating , I nearly missed ; as I rarely give the time of day to any movie rated below 7/10 . Having said that , I 'm so glad I gave Stone Angel the viewing it so very much deserved . And so should you , if you are one of the increasingly rare sensitive , soulful and thoughtful sorts of person left on this earth in living form . I must say that in many ways ( though not all ) , viz . its themes , execution , style , production etc . , Stone Angel very much reminded me of the much praised " The Notebook " . I am so surprised that other commentators didn't pick up on the many similarities which repeatedly struck me throughout this movie , so I can only assume that those who 've written comments have yet to see the Notebook . They may not share any Alzheimer 's theme , yet I can confidently say that if you very much enjoyed " The Notebook " you will certainly find much to engage your time most fruitfully with " The Stone Angel " . But even If you 've not seen The Notebook , nor read the book on which this move is based , ( which , incidentally , I haven't either ) you should definitely find much to hold your attention firmly - as long as your favourite genres don't include fast paced action thrillers . This is a movie for thinkers and those who like to reminisce about time 's passing , how life changes as the years pass , and what might have happened in one 's life as one gazes back through the years . This bizarrely underrated yet great movie really deserves a rating of approximately 8/10 . I can only blame its current lowish rating of 6.6/10 on the 11 % of idiots who gave it 1/10 . After all it has attracted less than 300 votes at the time of my writing this comment . Nonetheless , if those 11 % who gave it the lowest ranking possible were really expecting car chases and explosions why didn't they look .. for even a few seconds at the movie 's premise and promotional lines ? Oh dear .. Whatever the world is coming to , don't miss this most underrated gem of a movie - but only * if * you have a brain ( i.e. , your top ten doesn't include Transformers , Fight Club nor The Terminator ) .  
1	  A charming romantic comedy . The plot is a little too complicated-I tried to summarize it three times and I can't . Suffice to say it 's worth seeing . The movie is funny , beautiful-the plot is totally unrealistic but it works . Everybody in the movie is so nice and everything looks so great-it creates a sweet , romantic feel through the entire film . The acting is great-Robert Downey Jr. and Cybill Shepherd are in top form and enjoying every second of it . Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson are just OK but fine . If you 're a sucker for good , sweet sentimental films ( like me ) , catch this one . Also Downey looks great in his underwear ! Extra bonuses-the title song sung by Johnny Mathis and another great song " After All " sung by Cher and Peter Cetera .  
1	  I had watched as much of the series as I could manage to watch on television , but unfortunately , started a job that got me working evenings . I managed to catch some recordings of it , at least .. and , of course , purchased the recently released DVD of the complete series . Watching the DVD , you can see that the animation was a bit more crude at first , but they ironed out a fair number of the flaws after the pilot was done . The voices are well suited to the characters , and the writing is excellent . It 's rather refreshing to see animation getting back to it 's roots by reintroducing adult themes . Thing is , with the way society has come in the last century , you need to be a bit more blatant about it by today 's standards in order to be recognised as an adult-oriented show . The characters have very realistic personalities and are placed in situations that parallel what we often face in real life . It 's your typical sitcom in that regard , but the humor is more like what you 'd expect from late night television like a talk show skit or Saturday Night Live .. back when SNL was actually funny . Good job , Dreamworks . Perhaps you need to work with one of the more liberal networks to keep this series going .. and also improve the marketing of merchandise for the series to help defray it 's high costs . It 's a challenge to do this for a cartoon of a mature nature though . Hmm ..  
1	  The 1986 TV movie of The Spirit was a pilot for a possible series . However , Spirit creator Will Eisner did not like the film and thus no series was produced . I thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit ( sorry ) of the comic with a modern twist . I 'm sorry it didn't materialize into a series . Sam ( Flash Gordon ) Jones was a perfect Spirit . Nana Visitor was a nice Ellen Dolan and of course would later go on to Star Trek : Deep Space Nine years later . Maybe with the release of Frank Miller 's big-screen version of The Spirit , more people will be able to see this rare gem of Spirit history . It seems that when Hollywood makes a film from an already established character or idea , someone will inevitably seek out previous versions of the property and release it to video in order to make a few dollars . When Antonio Banderas donned the mask of Zorro , we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on DVD , such as the great Alain Delon version of the 1970s ( although all copies I ever saw were badly edited ) . Heres hoping someone will release the TV adventure of The Spirit to DVD soon .  
0	  The movie starts out with some scrolling text which takes nearly five minutes . It gives the basic summary of what is going on . This could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a scrolling text effect . Soon after you are bombarded with characters that you learn a little about , keep in mind this is ALL you will learn about them . The plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie . Not only does the plot change , but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie . I have never played the video game , but know people who have . From my understanding whether you 've played the game or not this movie does not get any better . Save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters .  
1	  There 's some very clever humour in this film , which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors . However , after a while it just seems an exercise in style ( notwithstanding great gags such as Balasko continuing the part of Dussolier , and very good acting by all involved ) and I was wondering why Blier made this film . All is revealed in the ending , when Blier , directing Claude Brasseur , gets a phone call from his dad ( Bernard Blier ) - from heaven , and gets the chance to say how much he misses him . An effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt . But there isn't really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout it 's entire running time . Some really nice scenes and sequences , however , and anyone who likes these ' mosntres sacrés ' of the French cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film .  
1	  I have to admit that Purple Rain is one of my deepest guilty pleasures . Purple Rain not only broke boundaries , it set a decade , the costumes , the music , the behavior , and the dancing ! To this day , my friends and I still jam to the Purple Rain soundtrack and pretend to be Prince and the Revolution . Now the movie itself , I just meant what I said in the title , because for the most part , this movie itself is made by the music . The acting ? Please don't let me judge on that since this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures , because I know that it was not Oscar worthy by any means . But I think the duo that took this movie was Morris and Jarome , their speech about passwords was just beyond hilarious . I just want to rate this movie on the concert sequences because I felt that it was what made the movie . Prince is a musical genius and created beautiful music . While the movie and acting is pretty bad , this movie is still a fun one to watch at night and even dance too . This movie defined the 80 's , so just have fun with it . Prince would want it that way , just to party on down ! Oh , boy , that sounded lame . 9/10  
1	  Anyone who does not find this movie funny , does not understand simple comedy . This movie is not a complex comedy , it is full of one liners , and sight gags , and will make anyone who wants to laugh , laugh .. The alien who is doing a Nicholson impression will crack you up !  
1	  This movie is really nerve racking Cliffhangin movie ! Stallone was good as always ! Michael Rooker put on a surprising performance and John Lithgow play a excellent villain ! The music is fantastic especially the theme ! The movie is action packed and never dull ! If you are a Stallone fan then watch Cliffhanger , you won't be disappointed !  
1	  Having read some of the other comments here I was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised . REALITY CHECK : The original series wasn't that good . I think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and Daisy Duke 's legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted . The Duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks , the shrunken Boss Hog was too cretinous to be evil and Rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment . It 's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series . Back to the movie . If you watch this film in it 's own right , not as a direct comparison to however you remember the TV series , then it 's not bad at all . The real star is of course the General Lee . The car chases and stunts are excellent and that 's really what D.O.H. is all about . Johnny Knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with Seann William Scott as Cousin Bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious Dumb-And-Dumber sort of way the TV series never achieved . The lovely Jessica Simpson is a natch as Miss Daisy , Burt Reynolds makes a much improved Boss Hog and M.C. Gainey makes a believably nasty Rosco P. Coltrane , the way he always should have been . If you don't like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn't be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect . Otherwise if you want an entertaining car-action movie with a few good laughs that 's not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind .  
1	  Not really a big box office draw , but I was pleasently surprised with this movie . James " I did some things to Farrah Fawcett " Orr co-wrote and directed this movie about an ordinary , average guy named Larry Burrows who thinks his life would have been incredibly different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball game when he was 15 . But thanks to mysterious and magical bartender Mike , Larry gets his wish , yet soon realizes that his new life isn't exactly as he hoped it would be . I must say , this movie really impressed me . Critics have given it mixed , and I must say the concept is really interesting and pulled off well . Yes , it is a little standard , but packs enough funny moments , drama and excellent acting to make it really good . James Belushi ( I think ) was Oscar worthy for his role . Jon Lovitz is perfect , and Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo shine in their roles . Michael Caine is perfect as the bartender . It 's just a good movie with a good lesson . If you 've never seen , I highly recommend you check  
0	  I can not believe such slanted , jingoistic material is getting passed off to Americans as art house material . Early on , from such telling lines like " we want to make sure they are playing for the right team " and manipulative framing and lighting , A Love Divided shows it 's true face . The crass manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic , the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden , is as poor a representation of history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians . The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the Irish Catholics in the story ; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves ! It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it 's obvious intent , so far from attempting art . This film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library .  
1	  I saw this movie when I was about 8-years-old and I liked it but it wasn't until I watched it again at the age of 13 that I really understood it for what it is ; a cartoon about a criminal dog with a real heart of gold " adopts " a little girl in order to exploit her for her talents to talk to animals . The dog star , Charlie B. Barkin , is murdered by his formal business partner , Carface , ( who is absolutely diabolical by the way ) . His soul then goes to where else but Heaven only to find a golden watch that is really his life 's time , which Charlie , being the sneaky but lovable cad that he is steals and rewinds , sending him back to Earth . Once back on Earth , Charlie goes about seeking revenge on the evil Carface . This is how he comes upon young Anne-Marie , the lonely little orphan that can talk to animals whom Charlie plans to scam for her talents in order to get back at his enemy Carface . But scoundrel Charlie actually comes to care for young Anne-Marie and his plans unfoil as he must make up his mind to do what is right after Anne-Marie discovers what her " best friend " Charlie has really been using her to make money for a new and better dog casino . Now he must rescue her from the dreaded Carface . I still love this movie even at the age of 22 . The idea and plot really are quite different and original from that of many other animated films . I especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of the villain for once . Carface was even better than he was in the All Dogs go to Heaven sequel . In that picture he appeared quite dubious to his role of villain .  
1	  After reading some quite negative views for this movie , I was not sure whether I should fork out some money to rent it . However , it was a pleasant surprise . I haven't seen the original movie , but if its better than this , I 'd be in heaven . Tom Cruise gives a strong performance as the seemingly unstable David , convincing me that he is more than a smile on legs ( for only the third time in his career - the other examples were Magnolia and Born on the Fourth of July ) . Penelope Cruz is slightly lightweight but fills the demands for her role , as does Diaz . The only disappointment is the slightly bland Kurt Russell . In the movie , however , it is not the acting that really impresses - its the filmmaking . Cameron Crowe excels in the director 's role , providing himself with a welcome change of pace from his usual schtick . The increasing insanity of the movie is perfectly executed by Crowe ( the brief sequence where Cruise walks through an empty Time Square is incredibly effective ) . The soundtrack ( a distinguishing feature of a Crowe movie ) is also sublime . You will be shocked and challenged as a viewer . The plot does seem a little contrived but the issues explored behind it are endlessly discussable . The movie isn't perfect , but its a welcome change of pace for Cruise and Crowe and for those raised on a diet of Hollywood gloss , should be a revelation .  
1	  Welcome back Kiefer Sutherland . it 's been too long since you 've appeared in a movie , and what a movie this was , was it 24 no , but very intriguing , especially with a pro like Michael Douglas in the lead as the embattled Secret Service Agent . Kiefer 's character is the one chasing Michael Douglas the whole movie , Kiefer 's partner , is Eva Longoria , the Desperate houswife . wow she can actually act besides flirt all day and look good , i wish though that Kim Bassinger had a bigger role , but other than that , i really think the whole movie was a blast from start to finish . This movie is what i consider to b e a political thriller , everybody played their part to the hilt . nothing was revealed to soon in the movie , so as to keep you guessing at all times . and i really think that Kiefer did one heck of a job here in this movie , but in my opinion Michael Douglas had the besxt performance of the day , thumbs up .  
1	  Without being one of my favorites , this is good for being a change of pace .. even if only for a few minutes . It all starts with a big fight between Tom , Jerry and Spike ( who is renamed " Butch " here ) . They 're all beating each other , but suddenly Spike makes a heroic and admirable decision : he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends . So , all of them sign a peace treaty and become friends .. which isn't going to last for long . Meanwhile , the three become affectionate , patient and kind to each other . They even save each other when one of them is in danger of life . The relationship goes nothing but excellent , until a very big steak appears and they all become greedy . The three are guilty to return to their usual fights and rivalries . But still .. to see Tom , Jerry and Spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience , even if only for a while . Oh , by the way , as a curious fact , two songs from " The Wizard of Oz " are played here in instrumental versions : " We 're off to see the Wizard " and " Somewhere over the rainbow " .  
0	  After Highlander 2 ( which I am still in denial about ) , I thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad . I was wrong . I loved the original Wargames , however , this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie . The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked . Whoever wrote this movie knew NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS except how to use a word processor . I doubt he or she even watched the original movie . The acting isn't even convincing . Please save yourselves , under no circumstances watch this movie . I don't care if the channel is stuck on the TV and you can't turn the TV off . THIS MOVIE WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE .  
1	  I first saw this movie 3 years ago , and it was introduced by then Disney chief Eisner and the real Jim Morris . About a month ago , it came back on TV , and this time I taped it . Since then I must 've watched it at least three times . This is a wonderful , inspirational , feel good movie that is intelligently written and believably acted by everyone concerned . It resists going for every sentimental trick in the book , as well as all of the other clichés . It is refreshing to see a movie where the kids aren't jerks and have a whole slew of behavioral issues , and the jocks aren't portrayed as testosterone driven muscleheads . These are just normal people who have dreams like you and I. In my opinion , Hollywood as gone the other extreme to what they term " gritty realism " , making movies where everyone curses , and has problems with aggression . This movie is about a man who has a dream , and is encouraged by friends and family to pursue that dream . The people in Big Lake TX seem so personable that I want to move there . As I said b4 , the film doesn't try to go overboard with sentimentality . Dennis Quaid , as usual , never disappoints . I 've watched him from the late 70 's , and he is so underrated . But this movie has excellent performances from EVERYONE concerned , and kudos to the writers . A gem in the movie is near the end when Jim is practicing in the dugout before the big game , and his wife calls out to him from the stands . He rushes over and reaches out to his family . The look on the faces of the three other pitchers sitting on the bench in the dugout is priceless . If you 're looking for a change of pace , then pick this movie up .  
1	  This is one of my favourite kung-fu films and is regarded as one the most popular Shaw Brothers from the late 70 's . The plot is interesting and twisty , the characters are cool each with their own style - toad , snake , lizard etc . The action is limited in comparison with other Chang Cheh / Venoms films but what is there is interesting with different kung-fu styles on display from the various characters . I recommend this film to those who think all Shaw Brothers especially Chang Cheh 's films are the same , most of his films usually focus on the 10 tigers and Shaolin vs Manchu conflicts . This film is breath of fresh air in comparison .  
0	  Ever watched a movie that lost the plot ? Well , this didn't even really have one to begin with . Where to begin ? The achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms ( that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing ) ? The house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away ( ? ) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable ? Or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20 + killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house ? Or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction . Add a lead actress who can't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty , but not in the way you hope . Given a following simply for being banned in the UK in the 80 's ( mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder ) it offers nothing but curiosity value - and one classic ' daft ' murder ( don't worry-its telegraphed at least ten minutes before ) . After a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up . Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe . What do they do ? Slide down and run like the rest of us ? No , of course not - they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon . It really IS only a movie as they say ..  
0	  I like musicals but as a Dickens fan I HATE this one . * MILD SPOILERS * Starving boys who have enough energy to sing and dance in the workhouse ? The poor of London coming out to sing ? Fagin and Dodger walking off into the sunset ? Not exactly faithful to the novel . As I recall , Dodger was publicly hanged and Fagin went crazy in prison . * END OF SPOILERS * Oliver Reed is very weak as Sykes , doing little more than growling to indicate his evil . Worst however , is Mark Lester as Oliver , who often comes across so awkward and passive you wonder if he 's really the main character . His portrayal is in no way helped by the fact that the best they could do when he sings is dub in the voice of a girl . Guess they didn't realize that boy trebles can be found in almost every church in England . Self-respecting Dickens fans : stick to David Lean 's amazing 1948 film or the BBC 6-hour adaptation from the mid-80 's . Avoid this bloated whitewash of a musical .  
0	  A model named Laura is working in South America when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a gang and taken into the jungle . They demand a huge ransom for her release . Peter is hired to get her home safe and there is a bonus in it for him if he can bring back the money as well as the girl . Peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend Jack . They try to give the kidnappers fake money in return for Laura but the plan goes horribly wrong and they have to bail out in the helicopter . The helicopter is shot and they also have to bail from that ( not going well so far ) . Also roaming the jungles is a devil of sorts . In reality its just a naked black guy with weirdly big eyes and a breathing problem . He starts to kill a few of the kidnappers and Laura escapes only to be captured by some primitives . The rest of the film is a bit of a blur really . Now I 'm not a massive Jess Franco fan , in fact to date this is only the second film of his I have seen , but even I can tell that this really isn't one of his best efforts . The films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening . The whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute TV show . There are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out . Devil Hunter is poorly lit ( Infact I don't think it was lit at all ) , badly dubbed , poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it didn't bore me . I think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it . For example a scene where Laura is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting . Another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed , hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes . Then for no reason at all the man in the trees head just falls of and hits the guy under him . It has to be seen to be believed . Then of course there is the actual devil . It is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes , he has very blurry vision . The film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80 's here in the UK and was banned . Now why it was I have no idea . There is very little gore at all and it 's hardly a shocking film . Minus the nudity I would have said that it could get away with a PG almost . The only thing I can think of is that it was never actually watched and was added to the original list because of word of mouth . There is not much reason to watch this film really unless you are a massive Jess Franco fan . There is plenty of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them but other wise I would say just pay for a ticket to South America and get lost in a jungle . It would probably be more fun . 3/10  
0	  Drawing Restraint 9 . dir : Matthew Barney . How do you know when you 're in the middle of a pretentious art film ? Is it that there is only 8 lines of dialogue in 140 minutes of film ? Is it when Bjork is wearing what looks like a giant furry pita on her head in a pseudo-Asian ritual ? Maybe when mammoth turds and spinal columns are used in a whale blubber experiment . Or , when you 're about ready to kill the composer for making a minimal , and still annoying , version of a Philip Glass score ? In any case , Drawing Restraint 9 is among the most pretentious of the modern art movies . At 135 minutes , it adds to its pretension by being boring to boot . I would call the use of color stunning , and the opening sequence interesting , but the rest of the movie looked like it was filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary . That is until it looks like they were trying to film their version of P-ss Christ , but that will be coming up later . Actually , the documentary-esquire portions were the best parts of it . The surface plot is about a whaling ship , and then there is a ritual about making whale fat . Then , there are the guests in the form of Bjork and Matthew Barney who are welcomed on the ship by being put through a ritual of humiliation which includes passed-out head shaving ( think frat boy pranks ) , nicotine patches , and giant furry pita hats . Then there is mutual evisceration , cannibalism , and lets not forget the giant turd . Matthew Barney has written that this is about " the relationship between self-imposed resistance and creativity . " That 's almost like saying , " if you don't get it , then you 're not creative in your interpretation , so sod off because I 'm an artist . " Oh , wait , that 's the POST-modern interpretation of that sentence and what the movie would be about if it was POST-modern . But , its supposed to be Modern art . Which is about the art itself . So , let 's start this whole interpretation bit , shall we ? The following lines are only 3/4 serious and should not be taken as any realistic attempt to interpret the movie . The first half-hour concerns pearl divers and the construction of a giant ramp . Obviously , the ramp is symbolic of the need for self-elevation to whatever standards you hold dear , and the pearl divers are looking for pearls of wisdom . Then , on a whaling ship , they build a crate that looks like it is in the crude shape of a whale . Obviously a crude element of foreshadowing . On the ship , they make whale fat inside the shape of the whale , and take out the fins portion . They replace this with a spinal column and later a giant turd . These are supposed to be the states of the movie itself . When its fat , its entertaining but bad for you . When it is the spinal column , its the " important " parts of the movie , or the backbone so to speak . Then , the giant turd is the bowels of the movie , or when the movie is crap . Bjork and Matthew Barney the arrive on separate ships , are put into strange humiliating outfits which AREN'T EVEN WELL MADE OR SYMMETRICAL , one suspects that they ran out of money and Barney was trying to quit smoking . SO , they put patches on his head . They go through a ritual and learn about the ship from a Japanese wise man , who tells them that the ship is scarred from when another ship hit it ; a crash or intersection , if you will . This inspires Bjork and Barney , who are different on the outside , to start cutting each other 's legs off and eat them so they could turn into whales themselves and be the same person . They intersect . Oh , did I forget to mention that this has been done in a Robbie Williams video ? Then , the pearl divers come back with their mouths full of pearls of knowledge which they let fall to make a stupid Venn Diagram . Barney made it through 8th grade geometry , obviously . Or , maybe at least some social studies . Oh , and did I forget Bjork 's ear-gouging I want to kill her score ? At times it is hypnotic , but at others you just want to assassinate her . Art film is one thing , but when you just throw up all sorts of symbolism in the hopes of getting a reaction out of people , it becomes a self-destructive joke . When do you cross the line between becoming a joke in terms of art ? Dali and Bunuel frequently made surreal pieces of nonsense but were more coherent and / or entertaining than this piece of trash . Un Chien Andalou had the sensibility to cram as much symbolism as it could into less than half an hour . So , can I recommend this ? Only if you like dull HIGH ART films with lots of symbolism and flat imagery . D +  
1	  I liked this movie because it told a very interesting story about living in a totally different world at the south pole . Susan Sarandon is such a good actor , that she made an interesting , strong character out of mediocre writing . The true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome .  
0	  This short spoof can be found on Elite 's Millennium Edition DVD of " Night of the Living Dead " . Good thing to as I would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it . Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper . In execution , it 's a different matter . This short didn't even elicit a chuckle from me . I really never thought I 'd say this , but " Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil , Mutant , Alien , Flesh Eating , Hellbound , Zombified Living Dead Part 2 : In Shocking 2-D " was a VERY better parody and not nearly as lame or boring . My Grade : F  
0	  The premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake I expected a lot sincerely . The sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept . The situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is truly awful . This time there aren't likable characters or violins unlike the remake . Also , the gore is not that abundant and when it happens it 's truly bad . The violence is minimal and it 's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that there 's room for heavy violence . I mean , there 's a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants . You surely expect something different ! When I watched it on the movies I wanted my money back . Anyways this is a clear example of how rushed out movies turn out to be a mess and demonstrate poor quality on all aspects . A mess that let down the fans of the remake like me . That 's why sequels are never welcomed ; at least this movie isn't as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original .  
0	  This was not the worst movie I 've ever seen , but that 's about as much as can be said about it . It starts off with some good atmosphere ; the hospital is suitably sterile and alienating , the mood is set to " eerie " . And then .. nothing . Well , somethings . Just somethings that clearly don't fit in .. and no effort is made to clarify the connection between the bizarre and yet not particularly intimidating critters , and the hospital they 've taken over . I mean , come on , biker duds ? Some band watched a bit too much Gwar . My personal favorite was the head demon , who looks rather a lot like a middle-aged trucker desperately attempting menace , while simultaneously looking like he 'd really like prefer to sag down on an afghan-covered couch , undo his belt , pop a can of cheap beer ( probably Schlitz ) , and watch the game . Honestly , I 've seen far scarier truckers . At truckstops . Drinking coffee . WWwoohHHoo ! Scary ! The other monsters are even more cartoonish , and even less scary . At least , on the DVD , the videos give some explanation of their presence in the hospital .. they apparently just randomly pop up in places , play some bippy " metal " , and cause people to be dead a bit . Barring a few good special effects , and acting that is not entirely terrible given a lack of decent writing , there 's just nothing here . It 's a background-noise movie only .  
0	  Patrick Channing ( Jeff Kober ) is a disciple of Satan / serial killer who possesses the " First Power " : even after being captured by detective Russell Logan ( Lou Diamond Phillips ) and executed in the gas chamber , he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder at will . With the help of attractive psychic Tess Seaton ( Tracy Griffith , Melanie G. ' s half-sister ) he attempts to stop Channing . This concept probably had some possibilities , I think , but ultimately " The First Power " suffers from routine scripting and film-making . This is nothing we haven't seen before , sometimes done better . There is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers . More to the point , it 's not very thrilling and it certainly isn't scary . Phillips is a hard sell as a tough-as-nails , cynical cop stereotype , and Griffith doesn't seem to be trying very hard ; best cast member is probably the distinctively featured Kober , doing his best to be supremely creepy . The climax is rather silly and the ending very weak . Not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind , therefore : 4/10  
1	  This is one of the shallowest episodes in that the plot really seemed like an excuse to just have fun . BUT , I appreciated this light-hearted approach and this is truly one of the best episodes to see on a purely fun level . Think about it-the crew members have encounters with the white rabbit and Alice from Wonderland , a Bengal tiger , a samurai warrior , a knight on horseback who kills McCoy , and a host of other seemingly bizarre events that just don't make any sense at all until the very end . Despite all the danger , you just can't take everything very seriously-it 's just too fun and the whole episode seems very surreal . So , on a purely non-aesthetic level , it 's great stuff .  
1	  When I watch a low budget film I know what to expect . I expect the acting not to be as good ( budget reasons ) , I expect the lighting not to be as good ( budget reasons ) I expect the sound not to be as good ( budget again ) . Stop judging these low budget movies like a big budget film ! I 'm a filmmaker myself so I understand the budget constraints on a low budget film . Stealing locations , shots etc .. the list goes on and on . I don't want to say all the acting was bad . Jose Rosete , Chris Angelo , Victor Zaragoza are good . Raul Martinez is a natural . Not sold on Carl Washington yet . He has to understand that every line is not important , some are throw away lines . I say if a film makes you want to see what happens next , it 's a good film . I liked this movie . I gave it an 8 . I wanted to see what was gonna happen next . Great job Quiroz brothers !  
0	  Don't even waste your time , let alone pay rental for this piece of dreck ! How it got made is beyond me . ( I don't know why there 's a minimum of 10 lines .. I 've already summarized this trashy movie , but , oh well .. ) The acting was awful , like they all needed lessons . The plot was weak , the ending .. Feh ! I think the cinematography was the only thing that didn't totally suck .. well , maybe the sound was minimalistically OK . The one good thing is , if they could make this movie , even make some money with it , there may be hope for any screenwriter with a REAL idea . So , you-all take heart ! I guess the same holds true of actors .. if these people actually got paid , then you can , too !  
0	  A reasonable effort is summary for this film . A good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement . Maggie Smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given , other actors were just dreadful ! A terrible portrayal . It wasn't very funny and so it didn't really achieve its genres as it wasn't particularly funny and it wasn't dramatic . The only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance . Target Audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages . A very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film wasn't as good and who the target audiences were etc . However Maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capability . 4 .  
0	  From the first time I saw the box cover of the movie and the stretched out photography I thought this guy , this friend of the ' Scwarz ' must be like 6 foot or 6ft 2in . Not 5 feet tall . Not that , it 's his fault . At any rating , I turned on the movie one cool night in Tucson , out on the second story-deck with a good cigar and let it roll . At that time my wife was having an affair and things were going down hill for me , so I needed a good diversion . But , as bad as the movie was .. I totally enjoyed it , with a bottle of Merlot too , I might admit . Truly , I have watched this movie many times . It always makes me feel good ! It 's not that it ' tries too hard ' to be cool or that ' It 's so close ' to hitting the mark for an action film .. It 's frantic . And then truly clueless . Then frantic again . It 's the best of the best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene . Wow ! I never felt safer in my life . Warm and happy too . I was thankful that they conserved on the gasoline during the chase , due to less production in the summer months .. anywho The direction was ' uninspired ' the action and fight sequences needed to be choreographed , or re-choreographed and tightened up , the sound was off the delivery didn't hit you , it just kept on going , the other way . The ' locals ' of that village that they were in , the town rather , were ' Off cue ' they also did not seem to follow what was happening very well , the would look and even ' stare ' into the camera lens . Like a deer in the head lights kind of thing only some of them with a smile , a smiling deer . I feel bad because ' Columbu ' I just bet has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in America as well as for his own countrymen . However " Baretta 's Island " is very lethargic and unbelievable . Even still I like it a lot . My now x-wife hates it , but I love it ! The funny thing is , I am pretty discriminating when it comes to movies I like or even ' love ' . All in all , I like Franco . So there it is . As a movie adding addendum to this if you like killing a few hours with truly fun to watch , straight to video-B movies or ' bad ' movies for your little library collection then , if you can find it , check out ' The Big Sweat ' ( 1991 ) with Robert Z ' Dar .. you know the big guy from ' TANGO & CASH ' . ' The Big Sweat ' , a bomb of a cop story with no real plot discovery and acting that is so lame , it might as well be ' on crutches ' and at the end of ' The Big Sweat ' I think they ran out of money , because they had a picture of the cast and just set it on fire and let it burn during the credits . - Good fun . But all in all , not as good as Baretta 's Island ' , I gave it a ' 1 ' and an overall rating of ' awful ' for awful-good B ' movie . I 'm waiting for the sequel , maybe like ' Baretta 's revenge on Montazuma ' ( Franco takes a Mexican vacation and gets sick on the water then , declares war on the water co . ) or ' Baretta 's powder war ' where as he would stake out a large drug lord in his country and chemically gene-splice and create a hybrid super bug ( insect ) that would be bred and dropped into the cocaine fields and eat the coke and upon passing it through the bug , it forms a chemical reaction that turns the coke to pure powdered sugar . Then another sequel he would have to get the young people rescued from excessive sugar addiction and so on . He could get a major tooth paste company to endorse and partially fund the project with careful product placement in the feature . Right ? ( *)  
1	  This film is outstanding and wonderfully scored . Prince 's Oscar for music was richly deserved ( many people don't know he won one ) . I think this is one of the best films to watch as a couple late at night on DVD . A great surprise : Prince does a fine job acting , and is pretty good at conveying pain on camera . Morris Day , Wendy , and Lisa are good in their supporting roles . Very cool landmark film .  
0	  Wow . I thought this might be insipid but it was even worse than I imagined ! Sometimes I like to watch a good " car-crash " movie : those that are so bad that you can't look away because you want to see how bad they can possibly get . This is really the only reason I could leave the television on - morbid fascination . It wasn't so much the acting , which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast , but the premise and the plot which never should have seen the light of day . The script , too , is groan-inducing . As for cinematography , did anyone else notice that they used a " curtains drawing " segue device , like in an old 50 's TV show .. but without irony ? At first I thought they must be kidding but the movie takes itself too seriously to have used this in a tongue-in-cheek manner . Don't even ask me about the score .. the only high point is the final song , by Morcheeba . I guess they wanted to leave people with something for their $ 8 .. glad I saw it on TV ! Just silly ! I wonder if this is why Timothy Hutton has had trouble finding much work recently ? I guess if you don't expect much , and want to watch a mindless thriller , it would be better than spending an evening clipping your toenails , which is why it merits a 2 .  
0	  A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell , two respected and talented actors , sounds like a great idea . An independent film sounds even better . The studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativity . But then why is this movie so bland ? Ask the dust . This film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters . No one is given a proper back story , so we don't ever know why the characters act the way they do . Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination , if you still have one left at the end of this movie . I told a friend that I went to see this film , and that I thought it was awful . Her question : " Not even Colin Farrell could save it ? " My response : " Not even Colin Farrell 's ass could save it . "  
1	  Having never seen the original Dirty Harry , I judged this movie on a clean slate . And I must say , I quite enjoyed it . Sure , some of the acting by Sondre Locke made me a little squeemish - but hey , it was the 80 's . But even if you can't get past her ( and I almost couldn't ) or her revenge killings ( which seemed a little .. overdone ; P ) , it 's worth it just for Dirty Harry . Or at the very least , the bull dog he affectionately names ' MeatHead ' :P 7/10 .  
0	  THE ZOMBIE CHRONICLES Aspect ratio : 1.33:1 ( Nu-View 3-D ) Sound format : Mono Whilst searching for a ( literal ) ghost town in the middle of nowhere , a young reporter ( Emmy Smith ) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker ( Joseph Haggerty ) who tells her two stories involving flesh-eating zombies reputed to haunt the area . An ABSOLUTE waste of time , hobbled from the outset by Haggerty 's painfully amateurish performance in a key role . Worse still , the two stories which make up the bulk of the running time are utterly routine , made worse by indifferent performances and lackluster direction by Brad Sykes , previously responsible for the likes of CAMP BLOOD ( 1999 ) . This isn't a ' fun ' movie in the sense that Ed Wood 's movies are ' fun ' ( he , at least , believed in what he was doing and was sincere in his efforts , despite a lack of talent ) ; Sykes ' home-made movies are , in fact , aggravating , boring and almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue , and most viewers will feel justifiably angry and cheated by such unimaginative , badly-conceived junk . The 3-D format is utterly wasted here .  
1	  This Film was really eye-opening . I have seen this film several times . First , when I was four and I actually remembered it and then when I was 12 . The whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday lives or just Plain going the extra mile to insult him . A great Movie for Non-believers and Believers alike !  
1	  Jackie Chan 's classic directorial feature POLICE STORY ( 1985 ) is among the most influential and over-the-top modern day police actioners ever to come out from Hong Kong . Jackie wanted simply to make a movie which would include the usual kung fu and also fierce gun play and other " urban " action which would later become very popular and typical among HK directors like John Woo and Ringo Lam . POLICE STORY mixes these two action elements and styles and the result is as wild as it sounds . Jackie plays Chan Ka-Kui , a police who gets to protect an important witness ( Brigitte Lin ) who would soon testify against a powerful gangster boss and his ring of criminal activity . Jackie 's girlfriend is played by young and sweet Maggie Cheung , who isn't as wild here as she would be in her subsequent roles like Heroic Trio ( and the sequel ) by Johnnie To , Savior of the Soul by Corey Yuen and David Lai and many many others . The plot in POLICE STORY is very simple but it is the action why this film was made in the first place . Jackie did of course all the stunts of his character by himself and also hurt himself pretty badly in couple of scenes , some of which are also in the completed movie like at the end in which Jackie hits his head ( near the eye ) through a very nasty looking sharp piece of glass . Also Jackie 's stunt team members almost got themselves killed during filming of this film . The scene in which a bus stops right before Jackie , spitting the kidnappers through the windshield , went really bad as the bus stopped too early and the stuntmen didn't fly as they were supposed to . They were supposed to fly on the car parked in the front of the bus but their flight was too short and they hit through the asphalt with hospital level injuries . During the end credits , there is a behind the scenes imagery and images of these injured actors and it all looks really bad and almost tasteless , but fortunately no one got killed or injured too severely . The action is more than plentiful and imaginative as can be expected by ( action ) director Chan . The now legendary bus scene and shopping mall scene at then end are most likely among the wildest scenes any action film has been able to deliver . Jackie always tells how important editing is ( which is true ) and it really shows in his action scenes and their timing which is perfect and makes the films look so ultra kinetic when compared to Hollywood efforts , for instance . There 's hardly any slow moments here and also those moments are interesting and the film never becomes boring or hard to watch . But there is again one negative point which I cannot stand in HK action comedies , which is this comedy itself . The comedy isn't funny especially when the errors and amateurish elements in the screenplay aren't there by accident but because of the writer wanted to add them there , without necessarily understanding that they are signs of bad script and stupid dialogue . I mean those scenes like the stabbing murder attempt at the beginning when the murderer just shouts and screams and makes faces and acts like a drunken clown from some slapstick nightmare , and he is there to " murder " that girl . This kind of acting is stupid and inept and I wouldn't like to see it in a film which is otherwise very great in its own genre . Characters also speak their thoughts which is also a sign of bad script because those " loud thoughts " are there just to make things clear even for the stupidest viewer and thus making things way too simple and " light . " Even if the film is comic and not so serious , these kind of stupidities should not be there and they cannot be forgiven too easily . POLICE STORY is a fast speed , full impact , balls to the walls action adventure miracle from Hong Kong and from the time when Jackie was very sad because of the bad result he got with the US produced The Protector as he didn't have the same thoughts about the film as director James Glickenhaus had and thus the result didn't please audiences and Jackie and he returned to Hong Kong to make more personal and inventive film . That he definitely did and the result is as wild today as it was back then in the 80 's . This is among the most insane action films ever , and it would be somewhat perfect without the flaws I mentioned . 7/10  
0	  Really it 's a dreadful cheat of a film . Its 70-minute running time is very well padded with stock footage . The rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes . The plot exposition is very poorly rendered . They are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together . There is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors . Please don't ask . The plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth . It 's a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built H-bomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour . Nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much passé by then . What saves this film , somewhat uniquely , IS the stock footage . I 've never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film . This is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft I managed to see . There 's a brief interception by a pilot flying , in alternate shots , an F-89 Scorpion and an F-86 . First to scramble interceptors is the Royal Canadian Air Force in Hawker Hunters and F-86 Sabre Jets ( or Canadian built CF-13s ) and even a pair of CF-100 Clunks . Then for some reason there are B-52s , B-47s and even B36s are seen taking off . More padding . " These Canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles an hour " . I don't think so since one of them appears to be a WW2 era Gloster Meteor , the rest F-80s . The Meteors press the attack and one turns into a late F-84F with a flight of early straight wing F-84s attacking in formation . There 's a strange tandem cockpit version of the F-80 that doesn't seem to be the T-33 training type but some sort of interim all-weather interceptor variant with radar in the nose . These are scrambled in a snowstorm . An angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about 500 meters . It launches F-8U Crusaders , F-11F Tigers , A-5 Vigilantes and A-3 Skywarriors . The Air Force scrambles F-86s and F-84s and more F-89s then you 've ever seen in your life as well as F-100 Super Sabres and F-102 Delta Daggers . The F-100s press their attack with soo much padding . The F-89 's unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo . The F-86s fire , an F-102 lets loose a Falcon , even some F-80s ( F-94s ? ) with mid-wing rocket pods let loose . There is a very strange shot of a late model F-84 ( prototype ? ) with a straight wing early model F-85 above it in a turn , obviously a manufacturer 's ( Republic Aviation ) advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the F-84 ThunderJet . How it strayed into here is anybodies guess . There is other great stock footage of Ottawa in the old days when the capital of Canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of New York City 's Times Square during one of the Civil Defense Drills in the early 50s . I think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in Canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the Pacific seems to be in the background . The use of a Jowett Jupiter is somewhat mind-boggling and there is a nice TR 3 to be seen also . Canada must have been cheap and it is rather gratuitously used a lot in the background . As far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who Ellen Parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture . And she most definitely is flipping someone off . Could it be , R as in Robert Loggia ? The director who dies before this film was released ? Her career as this was her last credit ? Its like the newspaper the gift came wrapped in was more valuable than the gift .  
0	  Every movie from the thirties is dated , but if you were to watch only John Ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others . i.e. Grand Hotel is comparatively modern melodrama . With Ford , there 's always the hard-sell of someone 's nobility ( Abe , The Joads ) . Always the over-emphasis of some heavy 's badness . Always the poorly crafted , awkward and obvious scripts . This is no exception . It 's just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment . And sentiment is all this has going for it . What Ford does here doesn't make me appreciative of Lincoln , it just makes me wonder how the States were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here . Ford went on to make decent movies . This is too dated to be anything but bad . It feels entirely false . Henry Fonda with a fake nose is bizarre . And no one from Illinois would pronounce the trailing ' S , ' or say " Shonuff ! "  
1	  This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time in my opinion , its thought provoking , funny and sad with amazing performances all around ! . All the characters are wonderful , and the story is just brilliant ! , plus Jodie Foster and Cherie Currie are simply amazing in this ! . The Ending is very powerful , however I won't spoil it for you , and I thought the character development was top notch ! , plus you can really relate to all of the characters , especially Jeanie and Annie , as you will be rooting for them ! , plus I loved how it moved slowly , and giving you a chance to get to know all the characters and what there about . I can't believe this only has a 5.9 rating on here as it should be much higher in my opinion , and it was funny seeing Randy Quaid in this type of role , plus this is extremely well written and made as well ! . One scene that really got to me was when Madge ( Marilyn Kagan ) , is totally embarrassed by her mother for having the party , and the film has many surprising moments as well ! , plus the dialog is especially excellent . This is one of the most underrated masterpieces of all time ( In my opinion ) , its thought provoking , funny and sad with amazing performances all around , and i say Go see it immediately ! , your bound to love it ! . The Direction is fantastic ! . Adrian Lyne does a fantastic job here , with awesome camera work , and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace ! . The Acting is amazing ! . Jodie Foster is really cute , and is amazing as always ! , she was extremely likable , caring , had a lovable character , was intense in some scenes , was focused , and she and Cherie Currie were the heart of the film as Jeanie and Annie ! ( Foster Rules ! ) . Cherie Currie is way hot , and is amazing here , i really felt sorry for her character , as she had a very likable character that just needed help , she gives a powerful performance , and created a very memorable character she was amazing ! . Scott Baio is great as Brad he was really likable , and did his job well i liked him . Randy Quaid is great in his serious role surprisingly i liked him . Sally Kellerman is great as the mother i liked her a lot . Marilyn Kagan and Kandice Stroh are both very good as Madge and Deirdre , and did what they had to do well as the other two friends . Laura Dern has a very early role here , as it was cool to see her , not much of a part though . Rest of the cast do fine . Overall go see it immediately , it 's an underrated masterpiece ! . * out of 5  
0	  I can't even believe that this show lasted as long as it did . I guess it 's all part of the dumbing down of America . Personally , like David Spade said , I liked this show better when it went by its original title - " Seinfeld " . What bothers me the most about this show , aside from the obvious , base sense of " humor " , and general smuttiness , is the pretentious way the episodes are titled . Truly great shows are still funny after many , repeated viewings , like , " the one where Rob gets accidentally hypnotized " , on the " Dick Van Dyke Show " , or " the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory . " In other words , it 's an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers . That the writers and producers of " Friends " would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes , themselves , in such a fashion , before anyone 's even had a chance to even see it a second time , speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers , but , also , of the stultified minds of their viewers . You read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card-like Neverland , full of greeting card sentiment . The true meaning of friendship ? I want to be a friend ? I want to live in Manhattan ? Wake Up . These people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors , but they somehow manage to live in $ 4000 / mo . apartments ? Get real . All I have to say to those amongst us that want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas , good luck with all of that . That New York doesn't exist for anyone making less than a serious six-figure income . But , good luck with all of that , anyway . Now , shut-up and pass the Soma .  
0	  Bad actors , terrible script , totally unbelievable ending - this film had it all . After seeing films like this , you wonder why the makers bothered at all . This film has absolutely nothing to say , all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror films . A total waste of time .  
0	  The film is almost laughable with Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters teaming up as the mothers of convicted murderers . With the horrible notoriety after the trial , the two women team up and leave N.Y. for California in order to open and song and dance studio for Shirley Temple-like girls . From the beginning , it becomes apparent that Reynolds has made a mistake in taking Winters with her to California . Winters plays a deeply religious woman who increasingly seems to be going off her rocker . To make matters worse , the women who live together , are receiving menacing phone calls . Reynolds , who puts on a blond wig , is soon romanced by the wealthy father of one of her students , nicely played by Dennis Weaver . Agnes Moorehead , in one of her last films , briefly is seen as Sister Alma , who Winters is a faithful listener of . The film really belongs to Shelley Winters . She is heavy here and heaviness seemed to make her acting even better . Winters always did well in roles testing her nerves . The ending is of the macabre and who can forget Winters at the piano banging away with that totally insane look ?  
1	  On an overnight flight from Los Angeles to Miami , Lisa Reisert ( Rachel McAdams ) meets a charming man who turns out to be a hired killer who demands her help killing a businessman or else her own father will die . Red Eye is a terrific thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats . The premise is similar to Cellular and Phone Booth but Red Eye is better than both of those films . Almost everything about Red Eye is above average including the suspense , the acting and the direction . Most of the film does take place on a plane but that doesn't slow down the movie . The film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots . Wes Craven does a really good job behind the camera . Instead of focusing on the thrills , he focuses on the story and the characters . The movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that 's not what the film is really about . I also like the way Wes Craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on . Red Eye really shows his skills at storytelling . Red Eye also works well because of its young and talented cast . Rachel McAdams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate . You may even end up cheering for her out loud . Cillian Murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain . The way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive . The supporting actors are also pretty good which include Brain Cox and Jayma Mays . The movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it . The setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape . Overall , the tone of the film is consistently creepy . The screenplay isn't as strong as everything else though . There are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer . Most of them didn't bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head . Also , the ending is disappointing . It isn't a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better . Since the movie focuses on the characters , there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps . If you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed . In the end , Red Eye is an engaging thriller and it 's one of the best movies of the summer . Rating 8/10  
1	  Even in the 21st century , child-bearing is dangerous : women have miscarriages , and give birth prematurely . Seventy-five years ago , it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth . That is the theme of " Life Begins " : a look at the " difficult cases " ward of a maternity hospital . Loretta Young plays the lead , a woman brought here from prison ( what crime she committed is not germane to the plot ) to give birth ; she 's conflicted about the fact she 's going to have to give her baby up after birth . She 's in a ward with several other women , who share their joys and pain with each other . Although Loretta Young is the lead , the outstanding performance , as usual , is put in by Glenda Farrell . Farrell was one of Warner 's " B " women in the 1930s , showing up quite a bit in supporting roles , and sometimes getting the lead in B movies ( Farrell played Torchy Blane in several installments of the " Torchy " B-movie series . ) Here , Farrell plays an expectant mother who doesn't want her children , since they 'll only get in the way . She does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses , including smuggling liquor into the ward ( this of course during the Prohibition days ) , and drinking like a fish - apparently they 'd never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s . Interestingly , unlike most movie of the early 1930s , it 's not the women being bumbling idiots getting in the way of the heroic men - that situation is reversed , with the expectant fathers being quivering mounds of jelly . ( Watch for veteran character actor Frank McHugh as one of the expectant fathers . ) " Life Begins " , being an early talkie , treats the subject with a fair dollop of melodrama , to be sure , but it 's quite a charming little movie . Turner Classic show it , albeit infrequently ; I 've only seen it show up on a few days honoring Loretta Young . But it 's highly recommended viewing when it does show up .  
0	  This is a very bland and inert production of one of Shakespeare 's most vibrant plays . I can only guess that the intent was to make the play as accessible and understandable as possible to an audience that has not been exposed to Shakespeare before . By doing this , though - by making every line clear and every intent obvious - they have drained the play of life and turned it into a flat caricature . Somehow , it is actually boring - a very hard feat given such wonderful material . The acting is forgettable at best - Sam Waterston as Benedick and Douglas Watson as Don Pedro . Others , however , do not fare so well . April Shawnham 's Hero is a pouty , breathless airhead that frequently provokes winces . Jerry Mayer 's Don John is a nonsensical cartoon character on the level of Snidely Whiplash ( though Snidley was much more enjoyable ) . F. Murray Abraham ( you know , the guy who killed Mozart ? ) is not in this version , unless he was in disguise and had his name removed from the credits . Given that the producer , Joseph Papp , is basically a theater god , this production is not only disappointing but head-scratching as well . Don't bother with this . Watch Branagh 's Much Ado instead - his version is overflowing with vitality and humor , to say nothing of wonderful performances .  
1	  If you 're looking for a Hollywood action packed kid-flick with the common bad language and violence this may not be the film to sit down for . If you 're on the other hand interested in watching a film with youre children that has actually some values like showing the importance of friendship and truth this is the film to watch . Looking at the program guide this is obviously what millions of other viewers have found . Not many low-budget independent films have ever been aired as much as Mr. Atlas . The film is actually very funny as well as warm hearted and shows some beautiful locations masterfully captured by the sharp eye of the obvious brilliant cinematographer Suki Medencevic . Also if you 're interested in looking at a muscular fellow with good looks the ladies can get an eye full . Let 's support those who make good childrens film buy buying their videos and watching their products on TV . Enjoy  
0	  This is one of the worst movies I 've seen in a long time . The story was boring , the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy . I 'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project , but it certainly played like one . It is not even particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take . The whooshing horizontal camera pans are a cheap and unoriginal way of hiding cuts .  
0	  SPOILERS AHEAD This is one of the worst movies ever made - it 's that simple . There is not one redeeming quality about this movie . The first 10 minutes are quite tricky - they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat . Instead , you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization . The lake was ridiculous , looked like an aquarium , and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed . Characters show their advanced teleportation powers , for example Alex Thomas who falls into the lake ( drunk ) , and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position . Angie Harmon put up a pitiful performance as Kate , made worse by the space-time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader . An example of this would be when she said , " Flashlight ! " in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half . Finally , the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that I have ever seen . It was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists . An example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on Alex 's car . I would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie . The ending was absolutely pathetic . The writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say , " oh yeah ! " Instead , we 're left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line . Unfortunately , there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap . I give this a . 5 out of 10 , the . 5 being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book .  
0	  MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is one of those rare films that established its place in film history immediately . Praise for the film was absolutely nonexistent , even from the people involved in making it . This film was loathed from day one . While every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds ( aggressive feminism or the courage to tackle the issue of transgenderism ) , the film has not developed a cult following like some notorious flops do . It 's not hailed as a misunderstood masterpiece like SCARFACE , or trotted out to be ridiculed as a camp classic like SHOWGIRLS . Undoubtedly the reason is that the film , though outrageously awful , is not lovable , or even likable . MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is just plain mean . As a Hollywood satire it is cold-blooded and mean-spirited , but in a hollow pointless way . MYRA takes for granted that Hollywood is a corrupt town , but goes further to attack such beloved icons as Laurel and Hardy , Shirley Temple , Judy Garland and Gary Cooper . The film seems to imply that everything about Hollywood is by its very nature vile . It seems to think that there is something inherently courageous about mocking sacred cows , but doesn't supply a rationale for doing the mocking in the first place . The film is also viscously anti-American and anti-establishment and anti-this and anti-that , but all in a superficial , late-1960 's , trendy way . Like CASINO ROYALE ; SKI-DOO ; I LOVE YOU , ALICE B. TOKLAS and other would-be hip epics , MYRA is a middle-aged vision of the hippy-dippy youth culture . It tries to embrace the very attitude that it belittles . But instead of being cheerfully self-mocking , MYRA makes no attempt to conceal its contempt for everything that comes within its grasp . MYRA BRECKINRIDGE has the humor of a bully ; there 's not a single moment of innocence in it . Its intentions aren't honorable . TIME magazine aptly described it as being " about as funny as a child molester , " but it 's not nearly as sympathetic . For instance , poor Mae West bore the brunt of so much of the criticism aimed at the film , being described as looking like everything from an aging drag queen to a reanimated walking corpse . The octogenarian star obviously didn't know just how ridiculous she looked playing a lecherous talent agent lusting after men young enough to be her grandsons or even her great-grandsons . But , director Michael Sarne had to know , but he used her anyway . Why ? Because , she apparently was the joke . Just like John Huston , John Carradine , Grady Sutton , Andy Devine and other veteran performers in the film , they are there only so the film can mock their age and use them to trash their film images . They are cast as smarmy self-parodies , as is Rex Reed , the arrogant , fey film critic , who is cast as just that in the film . But the real Reed , the celebrity hound , jet-setting , talk show gossip , can be charming in an obnoxiously funny way ; but as Myron , Myra 's alter ego , he is just obnoxious . Again , apparently for Sarne , Reed is the joke . You watch MYRA BRECKINRIDGE and you don't see actors , you see victims . None more so than Raquel Welch . No one will ever accuse Welch of being a great actress , but it is a testament to her tenacity and her appeal that she survived this film and her career prospered . Being in almost every scene , Welch was front and center as a target for abuse aimed at the film , but to her credit , she gives a remarkably nuanced performance . Though , of course , centered between the scenery chewing Huston and the almost catatonic West , Welch doesn't have to do much to strike a good balance . Even so , she renders her horribly unfunny dialogue with a deadpan smirk , with just the hint of self-righteous glee that would do any James Bond villain proud . Legend has it that Welch was snubbed by a condescending West and subjected to repeated verbal abuse on the set by bumbling director Sarne , not to mention being featured in one degrading scene after another , making it all the more remarkable that she was able to give such a cool and collected performance . The film 's only intriguing element is trying to figure out just what the film 's agenda is . The whole story is a fantasy fable , which should indicate that it has a moral to deliver , but what that might be is anybody 's guess . With all of its talk about destroying " the last vestigial traces of traditional manhood from the race , " it would seem to have a feminist axe to grind . But as a feminist , Myra is a monstrous figure , a sexual predator . Besides , Myra isn't a woman , rather she is a delusion of Myron , who presumably is a gay male . That might explain the male rape scene as well as the character 's love / hate attitude toward the macho , seemingly straight , deadhead Rusty , but it doesn't explain his / her obsession for and the supposedly lesbian tryst with Farrah Fawcett 's Mary Ann . The film is obsessed with sex , but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution ; all the sex is treated as being , if not dirty , than at least perverse and degrading . Turning to Gore Vidal 's original novel isn't of any help , because it is as confused and pointless as the movie . And this is a rare movie that actually seems to hate movies . Not just movies as a business , but movies as part of the culture as well . The film itself is wall-to-wall arcane references to old movies , all of which director-screenwriter Sarne approaches with a seething disdain . He has raided the film vaults of 20th Century-Fox and peppered the film with snippets of old films , not as an homage or to provide a social commentary , but to mock the innocence of old Hollywood . How can an artist - if you generously want to call Sarne that - make a work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in ? The very effort is totally self-defeating . MYRA BRECKINRIDGE doesn't seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty . It hates Hollywood , it hates America , it hates sex , it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and Laurel and Hardy and , well , you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it . In a very sad and sorry way , MYRA BRECKINRIDGE may be the first punk manifesto , a celebration of pop culture nihilism .  
1	  But the opposite , sorry bud , i completely understand how you can be dragged into a film because you relate to the subject ( and you have ) . This film is terrible , the main character would give any charlie brown subtitler a run for his money he just constantly mumbles which is always a laugh , most scenes just feel awkward with characters more often than not gazing across to another with a look of .. its your line now , then i will react . Best British comedy ? Please buddy , have a strong word with your bad bad self .. at the end of the day .. the sun goes down .. and this film is Awful . I mean well done to the people involved .. they have made a film .. and maybe motorbike enthusiasts may be into it but people that still live here on earth with an actual sense of humour will struggle with this more than smiling at the Christmas present they 're nan bought them .. was that overly harsh ? i do apologise ..  
1	  There is a bit of trivia which should be pointed out about a scene early in the movie where Homer watches the attempt of December 6 , 1957 ( at least that was the video used on the TV he was watching ) which showed the Vangard launch attempt , which failed . He is next shown reading or dictating a letter to Dr. Von Braun offering condolences about the failure . Von Braun was at Marshall space flight center in Huntsville working for the Army . The Vanguard project was by the early Nasa team which was at what soon became Goddard Space flight center . The army rushed the Jupiter-C , which was essentially a US made V2 technology , but worked to launch a satellite in response to Russia 's success with Sputnik . This error may have actually been made by Homer , because of the notoriety of Von Braun , but his team didn't have their attempt fail . In fact the underlying Redstone was flying from 52 and was the first US man rated booster , used for Shepard 's sub orbital flight , as well as Grissom 's . This is why this sort of movie is so good , as it hopefully will inspire people to read up and spot these bits of trivia , and in the process see what has been done , and be inspired to do more .  
0	  I am a huge horror / splatter fan , I even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid . I also like gore . The more the merrier as long as it has a point . After reading the other people 's reviews on the site I was sure this film was going to be a little gem . But much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films I 've ever watched . The acting was terrible , the dialogs were stupid , the plot was pointless , the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past 2 years . Usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie . But not in this case . I waisted 11 EUR to get this DVD . Unless you actually enjoy pointless gore ( for example the " violent sh * t " films ) avoid at any cost !  
1	  It is written in stone that Disney animations simply ~ must ~ be musicals . Right ? Where ? Show me . Because I found this attempt to be much more enjoyable for ~ not ~ containing the hokey made for five year old standard Disney musical fare . While the story was not as enthralling as it could have been , it was still quite good , enjoyable , and adventurous . I had hoped for a bit more , yes , considering the subject matter , but this movie is ~ not ~ the bitter disappointment or utter failure it has been billed to be . The animation quality is average , but the dialog is quite compelling , as is the story line , plot , sub-plot , and amazing creativity I found within this production . I will refrain from outlining the plot , as it has been done and done , but this movie is well worth a view if you are a fan of fantasy . This is , in my opinion , THE BEST Disney Animated Feature Length Film . It rates a 9.4/10 from .. the Fiend : .  
0	  This film is probably the worst film that I have ever seen . I 'm studying french at college and thus understood all the dialog , so the language barrier wasn't an issue . I must say it is really hard to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the movie . There is only one professional actor in the cast and I 'm guessing no professional directors or writers . Although I have rated it 1 out of 10 it probably doesn't merit such a poor rating . This is merely a futile effort of lowering its current overall rating of 7.3 to something more realistic . Perhaps 4.3 would be a more accurate rating because the film is a true non-event 100 minutes or so in length that you will never get back . The real shame is that I am sure some college student is busting his nut making a film twice as good and half the length . However if you want to join the bandwagon which seems to be rolling around IMDb you might as well go ahead give " Lost in Translation " a 10 as well .  
0	  John Carradine , John Ireland , and Faith Domergue who as players all saw better days in better films got together for this Grade G horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion . For Carradine it was in those last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory it was better to keep working no matter what you did and get those paychecks coming in . With that magnificent sonorous voice of his , Carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not discriminate in the least in what he appeared in . He plays the caretaker of an old Gothic mansion who movie director John Ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film . It 's even got a graveyard , but with a missing occupant . Faith Domergue is Ireland 's aging star and Carole Wells is the young ingenue . In the last twenty minutes or so most of the cast winds up dead that aren't dead already . The script is so incoherent I 'm still trying to figure out the point . I won't waste any more gray matter on it .  
0	  After reading the book , which had a lot of meaning for me , the movie didn't give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed . This makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else . Either that or he is simply bad . Most importantly where is the lightness ? ! From the very first scene , music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling , and this continues right through the movie . I think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie , this would make the story feel light - however they have completely failed here . Instead the music manages to give everything that ' movie feel ' , in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them , so that everything actually feels heavy . Another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic . In the movie we see Franz passing Tomas on the street , who is on his way to see Sabina . The introduction of this chance meeting / passing , which im sure didn't happen in the book , gives Tomas ' story more significance than it does make it light . There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed , imo for the worst , however this might have been done because the book simply doesn't convert well into a movie , such is Kundera 's style . This makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book AND movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film . A film which is as long as it is uncompelling . For those who haven't read the book yet I recommend just reading that . For those who have , I have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay-clear warnings .  
0	  Having searched for this movie high and low , I actually found it when I least expected , playing on the Sundance Channel very early in the morning one day . Why I searched endlessly for a small vanity project that Chuck Barris that was made during the last waning years of the TV show , I haven't a clue . The film is simply put horrible . The scripted part that deals with a week that is . Of course the highlight of the film is seeing the real performers that were " too hot for TV " or rejected for some reason or other . That part is still horrid , but campy bad which was enjoyable in it 's own way . Now that I saw what I sought after for so long will I watch it again in my lifetime ? Resoundingly NO ! Do yourself a favor and just watch the MUCH MUCH better " Confessions of a Dangerous Mind " or find old copies of the actual show . The girl act where there just lick popsicles provocatively was fun , but having to endure seeing Jay P. Morgon flash the audience has in all likelihood made me sterile . In hindsight , I 'm so very happy that this was massive flop , for if it was a massive hit , there could have been a " The $ 1.98 Beauty Show Movie " and THAT my friends would surely have brought upon the Apocalypse . My Grade : D  
0	  My one line summary should explain it all , but I 'll have a go at it . From the get-go , this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera , and that 's about all I can comment on . There were a few interesting scenes , such as the " Big one " that hit during the middle of the movie , but , wait , what 's that ? The earthquake * gasp * , wait a minute ! That 's Dante 's Peak ! Well , parts of it butchered and slapped in . I can't believe how poorly this movie was done , " borrowing " scenes from other , much better films . One wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown LA , ala Dante 's Peak . My advise , forget the Bond Wanna-be , Nash , in this film and go for the real thing ( again , someone from Dante 's Peak coincidentally . )  
1	  Samuel Fuller brings his customary playful and stylish direction to this seedy , pulpy story and manages to create one of the undiscovered gems of 1950s cinema . Richard Widmark plays a petty thief tough guy ( a role he perfected over the course of many movies ) , who snatches a young lady 's ( Jean Peters ) wallet on a New York subway and with it a piece of much-wanted microfilm . This is 1953 , so of course the microfilm is property of Commie spies who will stop at nothing to get it back . When the girl shows up at Widmark 's waterfront shack , sent by an abusive boyfriend to reclaim the film , Widmark senses the opportunity to shake her and her " comrades " down for big money . The plot thickens , people start dying , and Widmark and Peters fall in love . Fuller handles the love story clumsily , but more from a sense of indifference than bad writing or direction . It 's as if he included a love story under duress , and so made it intentionally unbelievable , as love stories so frequently were and still are in Hollywood films . Peters gives a remarkable performance as a tough New Yawk cookie , part gangster moll and part damsel in distress . When violence occurs against her , we genuinely care about her well being , and it 's typical of Fuller 's renegade , ahead of his time style that a happy ending is not necessarily a foregone conclusion . But the ultimate success of " Pickup on South Street " rests squarely on the world-weary shoulders of Thelma Ritter , who plays Moe , a feisty lady who makes money any way she can , whether that be selling neckties or acting as a police informant . Ritter gives the performance of her career ; in a breathtaking monologue , she conveys without ever directly addressing it the entire sad trajectory of her character 's life , and the hopelessness she feels waking up every morning to a world of struggle , crime and hardship . It 's as if every character Ritter ever played converges for one brief instant to give vent to all of the emotions they weren't given a chance to vent in those other movies . The scene is the highlight of Fuller 's film , and a highlight of 50s cinema , period . Grade : A +  
0	  Lord Alan Cunningham ( Antonio De Teffè ) is a nutjob { seen early on trying to escape an insane asylum } , with this castle slowly succumbing to ruin , likes to kill various hookers who resemble his deceased wife Evelyn , a woman who betrayed him for another man , with those red locks . This nutcase is quite wealthy and his bachelor status can be quite alluring . He , however , is overrun by his obsession with his late wife 's memory ( specifically her adultery .. he saw her naked with the lover ) . While the memory of Evelyn is almost devouring his whole existence , Alan tries his best to find true love and believes he has with Gladys ( Marina Malfatti , who spends most of the film naked .. that 's probably her lone attribute since she isn't a very good actress ) , who agrees to marry him after a very short courtship which should probably throw up flags right away { there 's a key moment of dialogue where she knows exactly to the very amount what he is worth } . The only real person Alan can confide in is his doctor from the hospital , Dr. Richard Timberlane ( Giacomo Rossi-Stuart ) . There are other key characters in this film that revolve around Alan . Alan 's cousin , George ( Rod Murdock ) , seems to be quite a good friend who often supplies him victims .. I mean dates , while holding onto hope of getting his lord 's estate some day . Albert ( Roberto Maldera ) , Evelyn 's brother , is a witness to Alan 's slaughter and , instead of turning him into the police , squeezes him for cash . Aunt Agatha ( Joan C Davis ) , wheelchair bound , lives at the castle estate and is often seen snooping around behind cracked doors . We later find that she is having a love affair with Albert . All that is described above services the rest of the story which shows what appears to be the ghost of Evelyn haunting Alan , someone is killing off members of the cast family that revolve around Alan , and the body of Evelyn is indeed missing . The ultimate question is who is committing the crimes after Alan and Gladys are married , where is Evelyn 's body , and will Alan go over the edge ? I have to be honest and say I just didn't really care much for this film . It 's badly uneven and the pacing is all over the place . It looks great on the new DVD and the " rising from the grave sequence " is cool , but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable . You really have a hard time caring for Alan because he is a psychotic who is skating on thin ice in regards to holding his sanity . He can be quite volatile . Who commits the crime really isn't that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off , there aren't but a choice few who could be doing it . What happens to Alan doesn't really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument he 's just getting what he deserves . Those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to Alan , as I pointed out before , aren't that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstances ( .. or advantages they 'd have ) that would benefit them with the collapse of Alan 's sanity , then everything just comes off less than stellar . I thought the editing was choppy and unexciting , but the acting from the entire cast is really below par . Some stylistics help and there is a sniff of Gothic atmosphere in the graveyard sequences to help it some .  
1	  It does seem like this film is polarizing us . You either love it or hate it . I loved it . I agree with the comment ( s ) that said , you just gotta " feel " this one . Also , early in the film , Tom Cruise shows his girlfriend a painting done by Monet-an impressionist painter . Monet 's style is to paint in little dabs so up close the painting looks like a mess , but from a distance , you can tell what the subject is . Cruise mentions that the painting has a " vanilla sky " . I believe this is a hint to the moviegoer . This movie is like that impressionist painting . It 's impressionist filmmaking ! And it 's no coincidence that the title of the movie refers to that painting . This is not your typical linear plot . It requires more thought . There is symbolism and there are scenes that jump around and no , you 're not always going to be sure what 's going on . But at the end , all is explained . You will need to concentrate on this movie but I think people are making the mistake of concentrating way too hard on it . After it ends is when you should think about it . If you try to figure it out as it 's unfolding , you will overwhelm yourself . Just let it happen .. " go " with it .. keep an open mind . Remember what you see and save the analysis for later . I found all the performances top notch and thought it to be tremendously unique , wildly creative , and spellbinding . But I will not critize the intelligence of those of you who didn't enjoy it . It appeals to a certain taste . If you like existential , psychedelic , philosophical , thought-provoking , challenging , spiritual movies , then see it . If you prefer something a little lighter , then skip it . But if you DO like what I described , then you will surely enjoy it .  
0	  When I rented " Unhinged " , I was expecting a gore movie . The box even claimed that the movie had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical release ( I now have serious doubts about this being released in the theater ) . After finishing the movie , I wondered how it could even receive a video release . The plot is as follows : A group of three young women on a car trip crash their car into a tree . These women somehow manage to make their way to a mansion , which contains an extremely sexist woman . Beyond this point , the movie is mainly composed of useless scenes that are intended to make the movie long enough for release . One of the things that makes this movie awful is the acting . Lisa Munson , who plays the main character , looks as though she is reading her lines off cue cards . The others acting is bad , but not nearly as bad as hers . Another thing that makes this movie bad is the camera technique . Many shots are taken by cameras attached to the ceiling . This gets very annoying as the movie progresses . On top of all that , there is very little gore , which makes the box very misleading . Don't waste your time on this one . My rating : 1 out of 10  
0	  After a day at work , I sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels . The movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so I tuned in just before it started . The first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested , but the lack of acting ability in Jamie Foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie . If there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to David Morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting . All in all , don't plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night .  
1	  This is real character and story driven drama at a level that shames most of what we see on TV at the mo . I was impressed right from the start . Don't be put off if your not a sci fi nut ( like me .. ) This could be happening on earth , the fact that its in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting . there are no space ships or laser guns ( None yet anyway ) So far I 've seen up to s01 e04 and I 'm gripped and wondering whats going to happen next as there are so many possibilities . The cast play there roles with pasion . Eric stoltz is especially strong . This show really stands alone well , it doesn't matter if you watched BSG or not , in fact they are quite different . I 've read some negative reviews from sci fi geeks who expected less drama and more aliens and ray guns etc but I would say ignore them . This is a really positive start to a show . Lets hope they don't cann it after 1 or 2 seasons like they normally do with good shows these days .  
1	  Highly memorable , intelligent and suspenseful movie from one of French movies ' true geniuses , the formidably able Henri Verneuil . The plot is an exact parallel of the JFK assassination , and takes place in a non-descript , fictional country . The film , visually as well as plot-wise , is razor-sharp . Shot with meticulous precision , it follows Henry Volnay , the Procuror who takes on himself to unravel the coup . In many ways , it 's a very disturbing movie , not the least for the cold and analytical precision of its comment on a so-called modern state 's inner workings . The atmosphere and characters are all utterly believable , and Verneuil left nothing to chance in its tight plotting . On another level , this relatively little-known movie just had a 15 years head-start on Oliver Stone , who was acclaimed for the " JFK " movie , a inferior film in many areas , the least of which not being credibility .. It 's a masterpiece , any cinema lover should see it , preferably in its original French version with subs .  
1	  It might not be the best movie of 2006 but it was a just a movie to excite and to think about . The Sentinel is a good political thriller movie which seems similar to or even borrows some elements from other political thriller movies such as In the Line of Fire and The Manchurian Candidate . The basic plot of this movie is similar to other movies like this : A plot to kill the President of the United States . Michael Douglas stars as Secret Service Agent Pete Garrison who spearheads the operation only to find out later that he has been framed . Kiefer Sutherland co-stars as a sort of rival by the name of David Breckinridge and Eva Longoria as Jill Marin who is a rookie agent going under the guidance of Agent Breckinridge and Academy Award winner Kim Basinger as First Lady Sarah Ballentine . One improvement for this movie could have been more action as it is by some sources considered just as much an Action film as is a Thriller film but a good thing about this movie is instead of just an assassination plot to kill the US President , it also concerns a mole ( traitor ) in the Secret Service who is leading the President in the wrong direction .  
0	  It 's hard to praise this film much . The CGI for the dragon was well done , but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow . Also , the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious . I was amazed to see " Marcus Aurelius " in the acting credits , wondering what an ex-Emperor of the Roman Empire was doing acting in this film ! Like " Whoopie Goldberg " it must be an alias , and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker . The story might been interesting , but the acting is flat , and direction is tedious . If you MUST watch this film , go around to your friend 's house and get drunk while doing so - then it 'll be enjoyable .  
0	  You ever sit through a movie and after it 's all over it 's like one big " wtf ! ? " . Welcome to Decoy . Another straight to video action fodder flick you can immediately forget about having watched or better yet don't watch it at all . Peter Weller and Robert Patrick star and are quickly wasted in this going nowheres fast mercenaries-for-hire action dud where the story is pretty darn bad and the action sucks and what 's the point of watching an action flick if the action blows ? Robert Patrick in particular hits a new low in an action sequence that has him firing a machine gun while standing on the hood of a moving school bus . Co-stars the ambient Charlotte Lewis and Canada 's own Scott Hylands ( of TV 's Night Heat fame ) .  
0	  So this is what actress Kim Basinger has succumbed to ? Mmm to tell the truth the film 's title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic , but simplicity can have its strengths . Anyhow by the end of ' While She Was Out ' I was left feeling rather indifferent . Not the worse ( despite being engulfed by negatives ) , but there 's easily way better in what is an causally lukewarm , but compact and unbalanced late-night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid , when she provoked an ugly exchange with some punks in a shopping car park . The problem here falls on the misguidedly erratic and foreseeable material ( taken from a short story ) , along with the very variable performances . The flimsy script was poorly thought-out ( which isn't so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off ) , so many wretched inclusions and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events . As for the bunch of stereotypical goons ( led by an unconvincing Lukas Hass as a loose canon ) terrorizing Basinger , well they were less than threatening , but hopelessly clueless . Watching Basinger scrounging around in the dank wilderness with a red tool box in her hand ( don't ask me why ? ) knocking off these wannabe punks one by one became ridiculous because it didn't elicit tension or emotion but instead clumsy jolts that were absurdly daft because of the stupidity of the lead up . Basinger 's performance is stout-like , but doesn't craft much empathy . Craig Sheffer shows up as her hot-headed husband . Strangely I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen thinking to myself that red toolbox is hypnotic ( why would she be constantly carrying it ) and what tool was she going to use to dispatch the next thug her choices were quite disappointing . Watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty , due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead . Susan Montford 's soberly slick direction lacks cohesion and energy , as it pretty much chugs along . I liked the opening credits though , with its hauntingly sullen score ( which is the most effective thing throughout the feature ) and polished photography . No great shakes . Doesn't ask much of your time , but I wouldn't care to see it again . However with the inclusion of a Joy Division song , it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen .  
0	  The one reason I remember this is that it was shown the week after Nigel Kneale ` s brilliant QUATERMASS serial was broadcast . The trailers made heavy emphasis that the main character had a mutilated arm which had me hoping he ` d be like Victor Caroon from THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT stalking the streets of London . No such luck because THE RACING GAME is just a rather drab thriller with the gimmick of having a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the bottom of investigations of corrupt horse racing . I suppose if you ` re a fan of Dick Francis you might enjoy it but setting it in the context of the late 70s when THE SWEENEY had just finished and THE PROFESSIONALS was still being produced , there ` s something lacking about THE RACING GAME . One trailer featured a car over taking another on a motor way , if it ` d been a trailer for THE SWEENEY you ` d see Jack Regan over taking a car and beating a confession out of the slags who ` d done a blag while THE PROFESSIONALS would have over taken a car and blown away the terrorists inside . I think that sums up what ` s wrong with this series  
0	  I completely agree with the other comment someone should do a What 's up tiger Lily with this film . It has to be one of the worst french films I 've seen in a long time ( actually along with Brotherwood of the Wolves , 2 horrendous films in a much too short period of time ) . It 's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun . Antoine DeCaunes in particular and Jean Rochefort being among my darlings , I was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor film . Lou Doyon is quite bad , as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they don't necessarily give you talent . avoid this film , if you want to laugh watch an Alain Chabat instead or some nice period piece full of fun like LA FILLE DE D'ARTAGNAN .  
1	  I have yet to see a film with Nolte in it that I did not like . However , this being said , he 's made a lot of films and I 've seen just a few . In my minds eye I am keeping the images of his performance here and the one in " The Thin Red Line " . Nolte has a a full range of acting talents . When it 's necessary to shout he roars like a wounded lion . His best moments are the ones I treasure in actors : when he just emotes through facial , hand and body gestures , without saying anything . Having come to the conclusion that our present generation of actors , by and large , have no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking , having no conscious appreciation of the mastery of Keaton and Chaplin , this generation of actors relies far too much on the mechanical wizardry of computers . Of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in . Had Chaplin lived in our times .. who knows , he just might as well have become an aficionado of CGI tools . I have not read the Vonnegut novel from which this film comes to the screen . However , the plot is not so far fetched or convoluted that we cannot follow the path laid , even with all its surprises . Of course on the outset it appears preposterous . However , it is also not impossible . Consider these for starters : A Spy at the Heart of the Third Reich : He Extraordinary Life of Fritz Kolbe , America 's Most Important Spy in World War II by Delattre and Prichard ( look at Amazon for more details ) . Consider : History Undercover : Piercing the Reich : American Spies Inside Nazi Germany DVD ( I saw this here : $U$ seems to be a History Channel production . So , is the story ridiculous ? Far fetched yes , impossible , no . Back to the plot . Nolte 's character is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts . Was it a type of passivity , that he got sucked into this role as it says because it was the best story he had ever written and he got to play the part ? That 's a hard thing to imagine any of us would grasp . But , it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things . The acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out Alan Arkin , always fantastic , is very good in a small role . I was really shocked by the ending of the film ( no - I won't spoil it ) and it made me feel terrible about the choice . Did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had spoken all that was necessary and that any more would be chapters added to a life already filled with many burnt pages ? Hard to say but it really jolts . Nolte gives one of the finest performances you can expect .. the premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things . It 's very entertaining and provoking . What great movies should be . A bit long but worth it . By the way , the movie music has selections from one of the best living composers : Arvo Part .  
0	  I don't like this film , but then I didn't think much of the book either which , although lauded by many as a " masterpiece " , I found lacking in character development and disjointed and illogical in plot , although it was far more readable than Fante 's dreadful first effort " Road to Los Angeles " not published until Fante became fashionable in the mid 80s . I was intrigued to see what sort of soup Towne would make with such meager ingredients . He has worked hard script-wise to repair the many shortcomings of the book but for my money didn't rescue it . There was never a movie in Ask the Dust while ever he tried to stay faithful to the book . I consider this film Towne 's folly . In a word : forgettable .  
0	  This is only the second time I 've felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film . The first time was for probably the best movie I 've ever seen and that was for Memento . Seeing Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento , as in the worst film I 've had the misfortune to see . Apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash-pile that it is . Let 's see , apalling effects , cliched script , bad acting and about 90 minutes too long . My wife and I laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad . Amazingly I watched it to the end , how I did that I don't know ! AVOID !  
1	  Apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties , Eugene Pallette as the gruff police detective , Jack La Rue as the " swarthy " Italian and of course , James Lee as " The Chinese Cook " , this film is THE great mystery of a murder in a locked room . For an early 1930 's film , this step by step " peeling of the veneer of the mystery " is similar to the COLUMBO series , except in this film , you don't have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance .  
0	  Welcome to a bad ghost story and someone 's nightmare . This horror tale finds a newly married husband ( John Hudson ) and wife ( Peggy Weber ) haunted by the memory of his previous wife and screaming skulls found throughout their empty mansion and lily pond . Is the husband really trying to drive his already anxious bride insane ? Or is it the learning challenged gardener Mickey ( Alex Nicol ) who has taken care of the mansion 's grounds since the death of the original mistress of the house ? This low budget horror flick has a story line that keeps you involved all the way the finale . Special effects are pretty bad even at 1958 standards . I swear at times the screaming skull sounds much like it should be in a Godzilla movie . Also in the cast as Reverend Snow is character actor Russ Conway . By the way .. the lurking gardener ( Nicol ) is the film 's director . You can catch this as part of AMC 's Monsterfest .  
1	  As much as I have enjoyed the Hanzo the Razor movies , three is definitely enough : ' Who 's Got The Gold ? ' , the final adventure for the Japanese lawman with the impressive package , is a fairly enjoyable piece of Pinku cinema , but offers little new in terms of ideas whilst taking a big step backwards as far as outrageousness is concerned . The film opens with the appearance of a female ghost , and looks as though it is going to explore supernatural territory , something which might have taken the series in an interesting new direction ; unfortunately , after the spook turns out to be nothing but a Scooby Doo-style ruse ( cooked up by a corrupt treasury official keen to keep people away from the lake where he is hiding stolen gold ) , director Yoshio Inoue is content to recycle familiar elements from the first two films , the result being a rather stale affair . Once again , Hanzo heads an investigation that requires him to interrogate women through the use of his mighty penis , slice up his enemies , and abuse his superiors . On the way , we get wild orgies , good-natured rape ( Hanzo forces himself on women who wind up appreciating his willfulness ) , and bloody sword-fights . If you 've already seen and appreciated the first two films , you might as well watch this instalment to complete the set , but be warned , this is probably the least satisfying one of them all . 6.5 out of 10 , rounded up to 7 for IMDb .  
1	  Even 15 years after the end of the Vietnam war " Jacknife " came not too late or was even superfluous . It 's one of the few that try to deal with the second sad side of the war : The time after . Different from movies like " Taxi driver " or " Rambo " which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the Vietnam vets . Their development is shown very precisely before and especially after the war . The problems are obvious but in all this tragic there is always the feeling of some hope on the basis of love and friendship . " Jacknife " might be the quietest Vietnam movie ever but after almost 15 years this is really plausible and therefor justified . Moreover , it can make us believe that the war has not finished , yet ; at least for some of us . The three main characters are amazing . De Niro has done one of his best jobs but Ed Harris is the star of this movie . Possibly , this was his best performance ever .  
0	  It 's like a bad 80s TV show got loose and tried to become a soft-core porn movie . Oh my god was it bad . The plots of each character had little relevance . The plot itself wasn't anything to speak of . Something about a stalker , I guess . In the end he shoots himself ? It 's not really clear , but somehow there 's a volleyball game involved . And the main character ( Randy ) sleeps around a lot . The only reason my friends rented this movie was because Casper Van Dien was in it , and they ended up wanting to fast forward to the scenes with him in it , which were barely watchable at that . Thank god I didn't spend any money on it , but I want that hour of my life back .  
0	  Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time ; Meet Me in St Louis , The Bad and the Beautiful . I awaited this movie with great interest . But what a disappointment . Some Came Running is scene after scene of go-nowhere fatalism . Sinatra is a sad sack , returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships , a disappointing floozy hanging on him , living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project . The movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens . The sequence is intended to be tension-filled but Minelli is no Hitchcock ; he gets so distracted by pretty colors , he doesn't notice the scene is a wheezing cliché and the characters are so thinly-drawn and poorly developed we don't particularly care that they get shot . ( especially MacClane ) But that 's the only real cinematography in the project . Otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars & living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours . Hell IS other people , apparently . There is nothing going on in this movie . The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after WW2 is handled more deftly in ' The Best Years of Our Lives . ' And either of two Inge products , ' Splendor in the Grass ' and ' Picnic ' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead-end town , with much more poignance .  
1	  In the rapid economic development of 1990 's in China , there is a resurgence of traditional Chinese culture , partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth , and more importantly , due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post Cultural-Revolutionary era . However , the resurgence of Chinese traditional culture , namely , the Confucianism , was not without disasters , because Chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part , and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example . Moreover , not only the part that should be discarded were inherited , the good part that was supposed to be inherited , such as the traditional opera , and its technique , such as changing face , was ignored in the resurgence , and facing extinction . The director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary China and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie .  
0	  W. Somerset Maugham 's Of Human Bondage is supposed to be a English language classic . If so , much must have been missing from the film version here . Phillip 's ( Leslie Howard ) attraction to Mildred ( Bette Davis ) is so utterly inexplicable as to make the scenario seem like the post-breakup retelling of a relationship from the man 's point of view . Being a family lawyer I 've heard many such accounts ; the man depicts himself as noble and always correct , and the woman is a hellion who has had no other objective than to exploit the man . Indeed , unless one is willing to laugh at the social assumptions of the film maker , this is an uncomfortable movie to watch . Phillip even indulges Mildred when she brings over a baby of indeterminate paternity , but the real high point comes when Phillip allows Mildred - enraged and now of dubious sanity - the free run of his flat , with predictable results . Bette Davis was attractive for about five years of her life , but that period didn't occur here . In fact , by the end of the movie she looks a lot like the Baby Jane character she would play thirty years later . I note how Howard 's character is always impeccably dressed and groomed . It tells me that Phillip craves middle class respectability . Someone like that could not run from a woman with a course Cockney accent fast enough . Phillip is , for most of the movie , a student ; such a person would have been more believable if he had been younger , and had the disheveled looks that bespeak the low income and the low self esteem that often accompanies student status - an English Raskolnikov , as it will . And balanced that by allowing Mildred a modicum of charm .  
1	  If you came into the film with expectations , throw them away now , because no amount of hype will do this film justice . To categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal . It 's a spy thriller , has elements of noir , bits and pieces of action , science fiction , and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative , mind-bending plot twists , and gorgeous cinematography . A lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative , both in good and bad ways , of other movies . But as they say , every story cribs from Shakespeare , so once you can get past that , you 're in for a hell of a ride . You will need to suspend your disbelief at some points , and while the set never becomes unbelievable , there are portions ( read : the elevator ) which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals . Don't misconstrue that to mean it 's on the same level as cheesy Sci-Fi channel movies , though , because this is on a much higher level . If you 're looking for action , you should turn away . This is pure psychology . But if you 're willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience , by all means , DO IT NOW ! Watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it !  
0	  I remember rather enjoying this a few years back but coming to it again , I wonder why . I guess it always looks good and the girls do rather well but the men do rather let the side down . Why oh why in so many English films about sex do we have to have such inept men along side the pretty girls ? What is more this begins predictably enough as a sex farce similar in vein to the Confessions films but about a third of the way through ( whilst we are beginning to enjoy the presence of the lovely Me Me Lai ) the film asks us to start taking it seriously . Not only that but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stilted . In short this is neither as innocently silly or as intelligently serious as it seems to intend . Richard O'Sullivan maybe , as such a central figure , could have helped but I reckon this to be one of his worst performances . Just worth it for the ladies .  
0	  So why does this show suck ? Unfortunately , that really is the only question , because there is no doubt that it does . For those unfamiliar with the premise of the show , the doomed to be shortlived series Cavemen focuses on a number of Neanderthals and their struggle to exist in modern day America and is based on the characters featured in a series of television ads for Geico Insurance . The concept is solid and there is every reason to think it could be executed successfully . I had to think about it for awhile , but then the tagline from the commercials - something to the effect of " We 're not that much different from you " provided me with the key to the show 's suckiness . Even though cavemen / Neanderthals are actually a different species than humanity , the title characters of this show , it turns out , are exactly the same as those of us who are boring jerks . Maybe its my background as a game writer - rather than a soulless , hack , committee-based writer from California - but this show had so much potential , and none of it has been realized . To start with , the producers should have focused on the fun things that would make cavemen different from us . What could conceivably be funny , for example , about giving them occupations like perpetual grad student and furniture store clerk , when they would have more compellingly been drawn to things like subterranean utility workers and guides at cave parks ? Why would they play prosaic games like squash , when a whole episode could be devoted to them trying get hunting licenses to go after game with spears ? A show like this could write itself , and it takes some willfully bad writing to make it quite so crappy and boring . Another tiresome aspect of this show is an attempt to portray the cavemen as being subjected to a number of stereotypes associated with various human minorities . Yawn ! This has been done so many times before , and never more drearily than this . And , as noted previously , Neanderthals really are a different species , so using them as a metaphor for racial stereotyping is both uncompelling and off the mark . Responses are welcome , including those from anyone who wants to tell me why I 'm wrong . I 'd like to enjoy this show and am just sorry that I have thus far been unable to . Michael J.

0	  The film looks super on paper . A romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross-breeding gold , especially with this excellent romcomic cast . I 'm afraid Lawrence Kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves . Adam Brooks ' script may well be to blame but you 'd expect better from the Kevin Kline of A Fish Called Wanda . Instead the two ping-pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around France . Jean Reno co-stars amiably as the cop with a heart and I guess wishes he was a star with a part . Mind you he went on to do those Pink Panther remake ( s ! ) so perhaps he was OK with this .. 3/10  
1	  Being from Canada , I cannot say whether this film is original in the context of Danish cinema - unfortunately , we , here , do not get to see many Danish films in a year ! I also cannot comment on Clausen 's acting in the context of his other roles - I personally found him quite believable - a touching monstrosity of a man , this Jorgen ! As for the actor who played Kenneth - why would his participation in a TV show rule him out as an actor - aren't we over such elitist attitudes ? International viewers unaware of his Big Brother participation will find him a fair actor . In spite of the movie 's faults ( the writing could have been subtler in some instances ) , I do subscribe to what one could call the ' message ' of the film - namely art 's essential role in everyday life , art as healing force . Art , as Nietzsche said , sanctifies the lie ( ' Kunst heiligt die Luege ' ) - it is a holy lie : the wedding scene is fabulous in this sense - a theatrical , not religious , wedding , celebrating love and life as play ..  
0	  I was so disgusted by this film , I felt obligated to warn off others . This film has no story , plot or hint of purpose . The film starts after the standard " lets be scary " movie intro , which by now every film watcher has become accustomed . So we can ignore the beginning completely . We are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static . ( Unless you have seen white noise - EEK ) Acting is a DISGRACE and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came . Having said that , even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able . Their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster . Senseless violence and what I can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up " eccentric " writer , who probably considers himself to be an artist , has resulted in a film which will test your patience . It was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said , " We have been watching this for 45 mins " did I realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag . Clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasn't the audience . Rather than suggest what the film is missing , let me tell you what it has : Dumb Blonde ( surprise surprise ) , Victims , bad monster guy thing , about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours , days , weeks , months .. and credits . Want a silver lining ? Well , the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes , but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film !  
1	  I revisited Grand Canyon earlier this year when I set out to devise a ten best list of the 1990 's . I first saw the film when I was 17 years old . How did I hear about it ? It was reviewed , and recommended highly , by Siskel & Ebert in 1991 , and I eventually caught it on video a year later . It 's a great film , a powerful film , a healing film , about the power of listening , truly listening to one another . I 've seen it six times now , and it entertains and inspires me with every subsequent viewing . But why the poor reviews for this movie ? Maltin 's movie guide gives it two out of four . Too melodramatic , too much coincidence , too sappy , are the expressions that I read the most . Yes , there is melodrama in this story , and yes , there is a lot of coincidence , too . But it delivers with an intensity and force that seems supple . For all of the " plot " that exists in Grand Canyon , such as drive-by shootings , a police chase , an earthquake , a love affair , a woman 's discovery of a baby in the bushes , another shooting , a near accident by a new driver , and worldly advice from a homeless man , this movie wins because of the smart performances by Kevin Kline , Steve Martin , Mary McDonnell , Alfre Woodard , Danny Glover , and Jeremy Sisto . It also succeeds because of Lawrence Kasdan 's skillful direction and writing . You know that this isn't just another movie when you consider a sequence at the beginning of the film that involves Kevin Kline being harassed by four black youths . Danny Glover plays a tow truck driver who assists the Kline character , but not before he gets harassed too , by the leader of the bunch . Listen to the dialogue as the kid suggests to Glover , " Are you afraid of me because of me , or because I have a gun ? " . Grand Canyon is filled with one perceptive scene after another . Steve Martin should have been nominated for best supporting actor as a movie producer who has a change of heart and then a subsequent change of mind . I think his character is a warning that " the good " can carry us forward , that idealism is a virtue , but one that we must fight for constantly rather than depend upon . I fear that Grand Canyon may be lost forever in the wilderness of non-new releases at the video store . But with the deals now on older releases as low as 99 cents , I plead with anyone who has read this far into a review from a reviewer that you will thank after having rented it , Grand Canyon is something special . If you loved Magnolia , another movie with a big ensemble about deep humanist themes , you 'll love Grand Canyon , too .  
1	  This story is told and retold and continues to be retold in every possibly way imagine . The immortal Charles Dicken 's story has been recreated in every possible way imagine . I admit I have not seen the classic Alistair Sim version and I 'm sure someday I will but I would be blown away if it touched even close to this amazing eighties version . I believe that if Dickens himself had created his story for film this would be it . The story is well known , I won't go into much detail because everyone has seen it in one form or another . A rich , stingy , mean , old man is visited by the Ghost of his former partner and warned about his mean ways . In order to straighten him out he is visited by three spirits , each which show him a different perspective of his life and the people he is involved with , past , present and future . Finally in seeing all this before him he realizes the error of his ways in a big way and attempts retribution for all the wrong he has done . George C. Scott is absolutely , undeniably perfect for this role . He takes hold of the Ebeneezer Scrooge role and makes it his own and creates an incredible character . He is not just a mean old man , but someone who has been effected by certain situations in his life that has made him bitter and angry at the world . There is compassion within him but he holds it below everything else and is very self involved . Scott delivers the role of perfection when it comes to Scrooge . Not only does the leading role make this film but everything else fits into place . This is a grand epic of Victorian England , Dickens England is recreated before our very eyes , the sights and the sounds and you can almost feel the breeze in your face and the smells of the market . Director Clive Donner brilliantly recreates this scene and leaves nothing to the imagination . I could watch this film on mute and be dazzled by the scenery . It 's not spectacular scenery per se but it 's real . The film takes us from the high class traders market to the very dismal pits of poverty and everything in between . The rest of the cast fits into their roles and brings their literary counterparts to life . Bob Cratchitt , played by David Warner and his entire family including and especially the young Tiny Tim played by Anthony Walters were wonderful . The Ghosts each had their own distinct personality and added to the dark mood of this story . A Christmas Carol is not a light story . Dickens wrote this story for a dark period in England 's life and it 's one of the few Christmas tales that is really dark , almost scary , and it has to be scary in order to scare a man who has been a miser for so many years into turning around . The dark feel to the story is captured in this film and is downright frightening and yet the end lifts your spirits and captures Christmas miracles . The score to this film is also something to be mentioned as it is epic and grand and beautiful to listen to whether it 's the actual score or the Christmas music , everything fits together . Apparently Christmas movies are my favorite because I insist everyone see this Christmas Carol above all others . 10/10  
1	  Made me wish my own happy birds could talk . Tisk tisk on the reviewer who dissed the movie . A sweet story that people of all ages will enjoy . Paulie is a lovable little treasure . He has quite a few clever lines that truly made me laugh . I especially loved the dance sequences during his showbiz stint . You can forgive the obvious clichés as you cheer him on in his quest to be reunited with Marie . A charming movie featuring two strong characters who genuinely befriend the little parrot separated from his young owner . Would have liked to have seen more of the woman who becomes blind and must abandon their mutual journey . I liked her artistic and poetic inspirations , a shame she could not share Paulie 's reunion . Bless Paulie in his new home , at last with Marie , perhaps joined by the nice young man who helped him defeat the antagonists to complete his journey .  
0	  This movie was supposed to have depicted a ' ladie 's man ' bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all . However , I did not care for his mission to settle down , because I didn't care for his character . I don't understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him . He had absolutely no class , or charisma . He should 've at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing , but to no avail . Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy . Not to mention , the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous . Does this man have any shame what-so-ever ? Had he tidied up , and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character , but alas , his character was bland and boring . Gina Gershon 's character was unnecessarily British . She could 've just as easily been an uptight out-of-towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor British accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie . The only two characters I cared for were the fish and frog . Now those two had chemistry ! Academy nominations for both STAT ! Plot holes , lack of character development , horrible acting , unnecessary drama , cliché moments .. What a mess of a movie .  
0	  A low budget effort from Texas that 's at least filmed well , but that is little consolation . Bad acting , or , should I say , bad over-acting , a pretty limp story line that 's nothing new , bad special effects , bad , bad , bad . Seems like a bunch of young folks are putting together a haunted house for Halloween , which is done every year , but this year things are different . Has a long extended lesbian theme that is not only annoying but definitely fills out the empty spots , of which there are a lot . Putrid , puerile , definitely avoidable , at all costs .  
0	  We are not in the fairy tale of the naked emperor . We may confess the truth of what we see , without being stupid , confess , that this show is in many aspects just incomprehensible and that it is clear , that much of it was created out of pure intuition without real concept . Well , obviously many people like such stuff . I don't . I prefer well thought and planed shows . And I also confess , that the show is much to serious for my taste and boring .. those love and drug stories .. There are so many exciting soaps with lot of suspense ( Dallas e.g. ) , but Twin Peaks can't catch my attention . I don't care about those people , except Cooper and Gordon Cole .  
0	  I am SURE there is some sort of IMDB cult that likes movies that MST3K made fun of . After seeing both this and " Werewolf " and reading dozens of comments about how underated they are , I became convinced that there is some conpiricy going on here . Alot of people are saying that people who hate it " are only scared by gore " , " Don't know good horror " or stuff like that . Well , I don't really care for gore , but I do want SOMETHING to happen in a movie ! Most of it is just the wife sitting and looking around ! Or walking around the house / garden ! A movie requires something to give it atmosphoere , you don't get it by just have pointless scenes were someone walks around and stares . Oh , and " Makes you think " ? Yeah , I was thinking " MOVE ! YOU @ # $ 0 & % ! " One of the worst horror movie I have ever scene ! P. s . For the record , I am a big fan of the old style of horror , Dracula , Frankenstein , That kind of stuff .  
0	  I am a huge Jane Austen fan and I ordered the movie from Amazon . UK just so I could see it without waiting forever for it to come to the U.S. I really should have saved my money . What is with Anne running after Wentworth ? The whole point of Anne Elliot 's character is that she was quiet and refined . She is not impulsive and vulgar . And Mary , was she suffering from a stroke or something ? Her speech wasn't normal , nor was her walking normal . There was no chemistry between the two main characters which made their whole " romance " completely unbelievable . In the final scene they even have Sally Hawkins wearing the same dress Amanda Root wore during the letter scene . The same clothes do not make it the same movie . In my opinion they didn't watch the 1995 version , which even though it had it 's flaws , it did stay pretty close to the book . The book , I don't even think they read it . This is kind of like a Cliff 's Notes movie of Persuasion . Hit on all the high points without explaining anything .  
1	  I 'm certainly glad that a film was made about Carl Brashear 's amazing life story . Coming as it did during the Civil Rights era , Brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups not willing to settle for a status expected . Brashear as played by Cuba Gooding , Jr. leads by example in the conduct of the life he has chosen . Very similar to Jackie Robinson who integrated baseball and made it stick by his character and conduct . As Brashear , Gooding knows that he does not want the sharecropper life that his father Carl Lumbly has and Lumbly makes it real clear to get more out of life than he 's gotten . But while Harry Truman integrated the Armed Services after World War II , the Navy still has its restrictions . A black man can only be a cook or an officer 's valet , the real fighting parts are denied him . That 's not good enough for Gooding who applies to become a Navy deep sea diver . Once at the diving school at Bayonne , New Jersey , Gooding gets it all thrown at him , mostly by the Master Chief Petty Officer in charge , Robert DeNiro . DeNiro may have some leftover prejudices , but he 's nevertheless a hero and one who can inspire if one can get passed racial divide . The best thing about Men Of Honor is the chemistry between DeNiro and Gooding . They certainly come from different places , but as they get to know each other , both turn out to be Men Of Honor . Other good performances to note are Charlize Theron as DeNiro 's wife and Hal Holbrook as the head of the diving school , a guy the Navy just wish would retire for reasons you 'll see . Men Of Honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change .  
0	  As interesting as a sheet of cardboard , this dispensable period piece has little going for it . It 's overly wordy and fails spectacularly to evoke the tension and fear that the real-life characters must have felt as they dodged the French Revolution 's fickle hand of justice . Eric Rohmer at 82 ? It shows .  
1	  Spirit is a unique and original look at western life from the point of view of a wild horse , and native Americans . The film focuses on the friendships and perils that a wild horse , Spirit , encounters during his life . Very well done in the presentation , using the technology available today to deliver stunning visuals that are breathtaking in their depth and realism . The music is fantastic , with songs by Bryan Adams , and music by Hans Zimmer , who also was responsible for the extremely popular music from the 1994 Disney hit , The Lion King . The story is not very deep but the fact that it isn't quite as in-depth as some movies doesn't in my opinion detract from the film as a whole . An excellent film which I enjoyed immensely , and that is suitable for all the family . Not one to be missed . ( 10/10 )  
0	  This is one of the worst films I 've ever seen . I looked into it mainly out of a morbid curiosity since I loved the novel , and I wish I hadn't . I turned it off after a little less than an hour , though I wanted to turn it off after five minutes . I wish I had . It disregards the novel a lot and changes all sorts of factors . Unless the film managed to redeem itself in the last 50 or so minutes ( which would be impossible ) I would in no way recommend this . Its an insult to one of the greatest writers of the 20th century . I don't think , as many people say that it is , that " The Bell Jar " is necessarily unfilmable , but this particular rendition could have been done without . I 'd almost like to see this one day in the hands of a director and screenwriter who can do it justice .  
0	  There are pretty landscape shots . Writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths . With lesser actors this show would be silly . ' Art must uplift humanity or it 's BS . ' Not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side . The lead character even says those who don't drink hide the shadow side . Wrong , he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes . There wasn't a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain . All the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes . The discussions between the characters was grade school , trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted . I tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here . I had to dig deep to see those i agreed with . I figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie . I was moved only once towards the end . The kid was way too passive . The scenery was nice and the music ridiculous . Just my opinion but nowhere show for me .  
1	  The movie wasn't all that great . The book is better . But the movie wasn't all that bad either . It was interesting to say the least . The plot had enough suspense to keep me watching although I wouldn't say I was actually interested in the movie itself . Janine Turner and Antonio Sabato Jr are both gorgeous enough to keep you watching :) They have a few cute scene 's that should appeal to the romantic 's . Overall I 'd give the movie a 7 or 8 . It wasn't bad , Just a little lacking plot wise .  
0	  This type of plot really does have a lot of potential , but it was butchered here . Honestly , I sensed the cheese element in the beginning , but I thought it would get better after the grotesque birthing . Whoa , I was wrong ! So mad scientist makes a monster , wants to brag to his old cronies before he kills them , but of course they escape . After that , it 's really bad . I should 've counted the times the rubber shark mask peeked out from behind some foliage , but I most likely would have lost count . Pan down to the blood dripping from severed leg to show us how the shark-man finds the folks . I hate being spoon-fed every aspect of a horror film . Oh , and after being nearly killed by a mutated shark-man and trudging around a jungle-esqe island , there 's nothing more cheerful than a middle-aged man reciting Shakespeare .. This is one where you 'll find yourself rooting for the monster .. if you can bear to watch this poor excuse for a flick .  
1	  I scooped up this title by accident with the Grindhouse Vol . 1 collection of pure Euro-trash movies . But this movie has a nice stamp of approval and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there . Stupednous it is not .. satisfying it is ! Watching this movie I couldn't help to wonder .. how come Sergio Martino didn't make this flick ? This has his signature all over it and punctuated by Edwedge Fenech ( alas not as well known as she should be but she did get a nice cameo in Hostel II ) . Double-crosses and triple-crosses underly and cement this film from beginning to end with Lee Van Cleef oozing coolness under pressure from the 1st second . Did this guy have to go to Italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system let this guy slip through ? Besides Lee 's more recognizable films , film-goers should try this on for size and see how if Sergio Leone would 've lowered his epic scale down on Once Upon a Time in America to half the running time ( and 1/4 of the budget ) this is what it would 've turned out to be like . So refreshing , it should be taken in during the day at home and make it for an couch matinée  
1	  In her autobiography , Laureen Bacall reveals that Bogie told her that she should not make such dud movies as this one or something like that . At the time , Douglas Sirk was labeled " weepies for women " , actually , he was restored to favor , at least in Europa , after he stopped directing . And when he filmed " written on the wind " , Sirk had only three movies to make : " tarnished Angels " , " A time to love and a time to die " , his masterpiece , IMHO , and finally " Imitation of life " ( 1960 ) . Then there was silence . Actually Bacall and Hudson characters do not interest Sirk . They are too straight , too virtuous . Dorothy Malone - who was some kind of substitute for his former German star Zarah Leander-and her brother Robert Stack provide the main interest of the plot . A plot constructed continuously , most of the movie being a long flashback . The instability of the brother and the sister , from a family of rich Texan oil owners , is brought to the fore by garish clothes , and rutilant cars that go at top speed in a derricks landscape . Malone 's metamorphosis at the end of the movie is stunning : suit and chignon , toying with a small derrick : she 's ready for life , the rebel is tamed . Now alone , because she 's lost Hudson ( but anyway , he was not in love with her ) . This end is a bit reactionary , but melodrama is par excellence reactionary ; three years later , in " imitation of life " , Sarah-Jane ( Susan Kohner ) will be blamed because she does not know her place .  
0	  I bought this movie exciting a gloriously gratuitous , over the top , entertaining bloodbath . I got none of them . This film fails on practically every level , not in the least frightening , or funny , it is simply terrible film-making , and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing . What is so bad about it is that far from being as raw , violent and brutal as it had promised to be , there is very little violence at all . Virtually no blood shed , and no excitement whatsoever . Acting , direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable . Honestly , it is truly laughable . I could hardly sit through this total garbage once ; I certainly will never want to watch it again . Don't waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this ; it is truly possibly the worst film ever made . If I could give it minus stars , I would .  
0	  How good is Gwyneth Paltrow ! This is the right movie for her .. too bad she 's completely out role . I haven't read the book by Jane Austen , but I can't believe it is so superficial and the characters aren't much more than caricatures . It wasn't probably that easy to reduce in 2 hours of show about 600 pages of the book , but I had expected more than just seeing old pieces of furniture and tea cups . I was taking a sigh of relief every time I saw an actor who didn't overstep the mark of overacting ( a couple of times ) .  
1	  I saw this movie at midnight on On Demand the other night , not knowing what to expect . I had heard of this movie , but never really any opinions on it . I have to say , I was impressed with what I saw . I was genuinely freaked out in some parts and I definitely recall jumping up in my seat a few times . The Blob was scary looking . Now , I look in a jar of jelly and wonder if it 'll latch itself onto my hand . Steve McQueen was really good as Steve Andrews , the protagonist of the film . I also liked the old man in the beginning . For a 50 's horror movie , this was very well done even by today 's standards . 8/10 .  
0	  This is a movie about how men think women think about love . No woman describes a one-night sexual encounter and declares it a love story . Of the ten monologues I felt only three really had any kind of truth ring through them . I kept waiting for the film to get better , and it did a bit , but never better enough . This is an interesting concept , and I kept wanting it to be good , but it never succeeded . Maybe if they actually WERE love stories it would have worked .  
1	  The story is about Ankush ( Abhay Deol ) - who is professional marriage witness , in short he acts as a witness for couples in marriage registration office - and Megha ( Soha Ali Khan ) who ran away from her home at Nainital to get married to her love interest Dhiraj ( Shayan Munshi ) . The story starts with Megha waiting at the marriage registration office for Dhiraj to show up but for some reason he does not show up . So Ankush comes in the picture here , who had approached Megha with the intention of earning Rs . 200 for his Witness job and he ends up helping her by providing shelter to her . Ankush grows on his side by working in a bank as an Agent & # 8230 ; Ankush falls in love with Megha and she too falls in love with him ( or kind of love ) , both agree for the marriage and Dhiraj comes back in the picture . Unexpected circumstances happen , actually I should say , expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then & # 8230 ; . Actually the movie story is bit different than the movies we see and I do not think so it will be accepted by the masses but if you are a movie freak like me and love to watch something different , then you will definitely like the movie . The movie is just an innocent love story drafted very well by the characters of Abhay Deol and Soha Ali Khan . The characters are so natural that you feel as if things are happening to the guy next door . The background music of the film also plays a very good role , it is just too good . The way Delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling . so let 's cut it out and sum it up . Story : A very common story carried very well and transformed to a wonderful experience . Music : Well , as it was Himesh Reshammiya creation , so I did not expect much but still I liked couple of songs of the movie including the Qawwali . Acting : Abhay Deol was the most impressive , very natural and innocent acting but he should stay away from singing in the songs . Soha Ali Khan , she is a doll , a very cute doll I must say . Again very innocent and natural acting and these both actors perfectly fit into their characters . Apart from these two , Shayan Munshi needs some acting lessons and may be few layers of fat to cover the bones . Other actors did their job well . Stars : I would also give it 3.5 stars out of 5 . You will enjoy the movie if watched in the theatre , I would recommend watching it in theatre if you are a movie freak and accept uncommon stories . Otherwise wait for the DVD to arrive . The movie will definitely won't be liked by the masses and the business it can do is from word of mouth publicity .  
0	  Cybil Richards directs another Full Moon / Surrender Cinema masterpiece of erotica . This time Jacqualine Lovell ( dressed in rather fetching silver outfit ) is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity . However she can't resist watching the tapes and she kinda likes them . The sex scenes are well filmed and set to a superb soundtrack ( at least for this sort of film ) . The cast are largely awful and mainly very average looking too . Jacqueline Lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between viewing the sex files she manages to expose her chest and fumble a little down below . She also fits in a little lesbian activity . To be honest Lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare . Here she looks great naked but actually is much more appealing in her silver attire narrating the ' drama ' . Utterly rubbish movie with Lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming features . Mediocre even for Surrender 's output and clearly a new budget low for them also .  
1	  I was a bit scared to watch this movie due to its rates . But living in Italy titles like this never ever come across and I love step so much that I decided to give it try . And how surprised I was ! The story is different from any other dance-movie I 've seen lately , with a deeper meaning than just " winning " . It 's touching and well written and well directed . Raya is such a strong character , I love the fact that she never doubts herself , she 's so mature and focused and AWARE of her TALENT ( and what talent Rutina Wesley has , my jaw dropped in the final dance scene ) . The way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is , honestly , inspiring . Also , the fact that she 's not the typical super-hot chick ( see Jessica Alba , Briana Evigan , Jenna Dewan , Zoe Seldana .. ) makes her really appealing and real . Seriously , why is this movie rated so low ? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it 's a good work . Really good actually . I even cried at the end of the movie . And the dancing routines are just sick .  
1	  I must admit I am a big fan of South Park and was expecting Basketball to be funny but nowhere near as good as it turned out to be ! I think this is what happens when you mix David Zucker , Matt Stone , and Trey Parker together . This movie has so much replay value and at no point bothers to take itself seriously . The slap stick style humor mixed with Stone and Parker just works flawlessly . The kind of humor present in Basketball was not popular upon the time of it 's release and had it come out today it would be a hit . Don't bother trying to be critical , just leave your brain at the door and expect endless laughs to come . Recommended to anyone with a good sense of humor .  
1	  I thought Rachel York was fantastic as " Lucy . " I have seen her in " Kiss Me , Kate " and " Victor / Victoria , " as well , and in each of these performances she has developed very different , and very real , characterizations . She is a chameleon who can play ( and sing ) anything ! I am very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here regarding Rachel 's performance in " Lucy . " Even some bonafide TV and entertainment critics seem to have missed the point of her portrayal . So many people have focused on the fact that Rachel doesn't really look like Lucy . My response to that is , " So what ? " I wasn't looking for a superficial impersonation of Lucy . I wanted to know more about the real woman behind the clown . And Rachel certainly gave us that , in great depth . I also didn't want to see someone simply " doing " classic Lucy routines . Therefore I was very pleased with the decision by the producers and director to have Rachel portray Lucy in rehearsal for the most memorable of these skits - Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory . ( It seems that some of the reviewers didn't realize that these two scenes were meant to be rehearsal sequences and not the actual skits ) . This approach , I thought , gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know by heart . I also thought Rachel was terrifically fresh and funny in these scenes . And she absolutely nailed the routines that were recreated - the Professor and the Grape Stomping , in particular . There was one moment in the Grape scene where the corner of Rachel 's mouth had the exact little upturn that I remember Lucy having . I couldn't believe she was able to capture that - and so naturally . I wonder if many of the folks who criticized the performance were expecting to see the Lucille Ball of " I Love Lucy " throughout the entire movie . After all , those of us who came to know her only through TV would not have any idea what Lucy was really like in her early movie years . I think Rachel showed a natural progression in the character that was brilliant . She planted all the right seeds for us to see the clown just waiting to emerge , given the right set of circumstances . Lucy didn't fit the mold of the old studio system . In her frustrated attempts to become the stereotypical movie star of that era , she kept repressing what would prove to be her ultimate gifts . I believe that Rachel deftly captured the comedy , drama , wit , sadness , anger , passion , love , ambition , loyalty , sexiness , self absorption , childishness , and stoicism all rolled into one complex American icon . And she did it with an authenticity and freshness that was totally endearing . " Lucy " was a star turn for Rachel York . I hope it brings a flood of great roles her way in the future . I also hope it brings her an Emmy .  
0	  I can't say that Wargames : The Dead Code is the worst movie I 've ever seen , as it had one or two decent moments , but I can easily say it 's the most transparent movie I 've ever seen . Not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10 + minutes in advance . There was no subtlety to anything the movie did , no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes . Every spoken or typed line 's intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to " get into " the movie . I found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line , and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience , far more often than I found myself enjoying the movie .  
0	  The really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget " Halestorm Entertainment " has had to work with . All involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash . Not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful , but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best . The soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop PC . The worst part of all is that I actually sat through the whole thing . I think just because I couldn't believe that I had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater I was watching it in had actually agreed to show the " film " .  
1	  If you 're a fan of Gothic horror , then you 're definitely absolutely guaranteed to LOVE this wondrous Italian 60 's film " Castle of Blood " . We 're really talking about creepily creaking doors , eerie portraits that appear to be moving , spontaneously dying candles although there 's no wind and smoke coming from underneath heavy wooden chamber doors . Speaking in terms of atmosphere and style , this masterful piece of Gothic film-making is one of the best out there ; just one tiny league below landmarks such as " Black Sunday " , " The Three Faces of Fear " and " Curse of the Crying Woman " . The prominent directors duo Sergio Corbucci ( " The Great Silence " , " Django " ) and Antonio Margheriti ( " Cannibal Apocalypse " , " Killer Fish " ) are successful in all areas , including a powerful plot ( one that is genuinely nightmare inducing ) , ultra-sinister scenery and filming locations , stylish black and white photography , spine-chilling music and a brilliant gathering of talented performers . Barbara Steele , starlet of the aforementioned " Black Sunday " and Italian goth-muse number one , shines brightly again as a spiritually tormented character and she 's literally surrounded by excellent co-players . One of them , Silvano Tranquilli , even gives away a fairly credential depiction of author Edgar Allan Poe . The story involves him and another wealthy visitor of a countryside tavern challenging a brutal young journalist to accept a morbid wager . If he  Alan Foster  would survive spending one night in the infamous Blackwood Castle , he receives the astonishing reward of $ 10 and a newspaper interview with Poe . Needless to say the ordeal is much more dangerous than it sounds , even for somebody like Alan Foster who 's a firm non-believer in ghosts and vampires . The night starts out great for him , as he even meets up with the stunningly beautiful woman of his dreams , but gradually he learns that Blackwood Castle is a hellish place where the ghosts of the previously deceased visitors are trapped for all eternity . I don't know about you , but this is seriously one of my favorite horror movie premises of all time . Co-director Antonio Margheriti clearly was proud of this film as well , because he remade it himself a couple of years later as " Web of the Spider " . That movie had a handful of trumps , like for example the casting of no less than Klaus Kinski in the role of Edgar Allan Poe , but in general this original is vastly superior . " Castle of Blood " literally oozes with atmosphere and maintains a thoroughly unsettling ambiance throughout . This truly is one of the rare films that can make the hair on your arms and back of the neck rise with fear if you watch it in the right circumstances . Watch it late at night , preferably alone and in a candle lit room , and you 'll get an idea about the true definition of horror .  
1	  This is one of those westerns that , well , stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog . Very few can hold up to it over the long haul . That said , the rest is pretty bad . Nevertheless I am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of The Wild Bunch , Junior Bonner , and perhaps a few more . It is riddled with weaknesses , John Drew Barrimore the most glaring . However it does have one truly memorable scene . Nothing like it . Its right after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff , and goes to Jack Elams place trying to goad him into a fight . Wonderful stuff . Right up with the best in any western .  
1	  It surprises me how much I love this movie despite the fact that I don't really like dogs . Fox , Field , and Ameche do a wonderful job with the voices of Chance , Sassy and Shadow , and the acting by the animals themselves is just amazing . I have seen this movie 72 times already ( I know that sounds scary , but it 's true ! ) , and every time the ending scenes still get me . I highly recommend it to people of all ages and especially to animal lovers . It is indeed my all-time favorite movie !  
0	  .. to not live in Montana and especially not to live there at the end of the 19th century . " A river runs through it " certainly is a well made movie from a cineastic stand-point . Great landscapes , Redford acting well . Unfortunately , the story is bad ( if there is a story at all ) . I felt sorry for the narrator / author , who is as dry , narrow-minded a character as his father , a preacher . Being driven , not driving his own life , he is left to watch his brother , who is also caged in the small town environment , losing his life . The author never even comes close to undestand his brother 's motivations , but at least realizes , that he is lacking the slightest amount of homour / fun . All there is , is fly-fishing , where he follows even as an old man the style of his father . The end is not surprising , it is forseeable from the very beginning . Definitely NOT a must-see ( 3 / 10 )  
0	  This is a pretty bad movie . But not so bad as it 's reputation suggests . The production values aren't too bad and there is the odd effective scene . And it does have an 80 's cheezoid veneer that means that it is always kind of fun . Watch out , too , for Jimmy Nail 's brief appearance - his attempt at an American accent is so astoundingly rubbish it 's fantastic . Fantastic too are Sybil Danning 's breasts - they make a brief appearance in the movie but the scene is repeated umpteen times in the end credits in what can only be described as the 12 " remix of Sybil Danning 's boobs . Has to be seen to be believed . As a horror movie it isn't scary , the effects are silly and Christopher Lee turns up to sleepwalk through his performance . I guess he was buying a new house and needed some cash for the deposit . The two central characters - the man and the woman - were so negligible that I have forgotten almost everything about them and I just watched this movie earlier tonight . The werewolves are noticeably less impressive than in the original movie , in fact , bizarrely , they sometimes look more like badly burned apes . The eastern European setting is quite good and the music provided by the new wave band Babel , while being pretty terrible , does at least give the film some added cheese . Overall ? Good for a laugh . Not good quality but did you seriously expect it to be ? And , at the very least , you 've always got Sybil 's knockers .  
1	  This impossible tale is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man , in a mortal world . Her " community " is open among it 's members , but she conceals her witchcraft from the mortals . Hmm .. this is starting to sound familiar . LOL . It 's not your typical movie . Very " campy " performances by Jack Lemmon and Ernie Kovacs keep things from getting dull . Kim Novak is always a pleasure on screen , but I found her pairing with James Stewart unusual ( but not fatal to the story ) . With re-newed interest in all things witchy and dark , this film deserves to be discovered and re-discovered by old and new audiences .. IT 'S STILL A HOOT !  
1	  Rosalind Russell executes a power-house performance as Rosie Lord , a very wealthy woman with greedy heirs . With an Auntie Mame-type character , this actress can never go wrong . Her very-real terror at being in an insane assylum is a wonderful piece of acting . Everyone should watch this .  
1	  Maslin Beach is a real nudist / naturist beach south of Adelaide , on the Fleurieu Peninsula , in South Australia . It is also the name of an Australian film that used the beach as a location . Maslin Beach is labelled a romantic comedy . This could be slightly misleading , as it is not a ' hilarious ' film , nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense , but it does have light-hearted moments . Much as life itself , there are also moments of sadness too . It is also entirely shot at the nudist beach mentioned above , and nudity runs throughout the length of film . The viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal , and concentrate on the plot , not the copious amount of flesh . Simon and Marcie ( Michael Allen and Eliza Lovell ) arrive by car at a beach-side car park . They take their belongings to the beach , and while they are walking , a voice-over from Simon talks about his confusion about what real love is . The rest of the film is an exploration of this , framed by one complete day at the beach . The basic story is of what happens to Simon 's love life , but there are also many other characters highlighted in several separate vignettes . When they arrive at the beach , both Simon and Marcie appear bored with each other . Marcie sees them as a ' Romeo and Juliet ' romantic couple . Simon is just bored with it all . Next , we are introduced to Gail ( Bonnie-Jaye Lawrence ) , Paula ( Zara Collins ) and Jenny ( Jennifer Ross ) . They are walking down the beach together discussing Gail 's chances of finding the ' perfect ' man , aided by the ' powers ' of a necklace that brought good luck to her Grandmother . However , there are many more interesting people on the beach , not all of them ' attractive ' and young ( part of the realism of this film ) . To service the beach 's patrons there is a flatulent , short-sighted ice-cream salesperson with a van . This is Ben ( Gary Waddell ) , who is a friend of Simon , and is also his unofficial counsellor . I would think that this character is the main comic element . It is hard to say though , as there is nothing about Ben that would make you laugh aloud , unless you were intoxicated , male and very young ! Maslin Beach does have a major redeeming feature though , and that is that it does not dwell too long on any one subject . As the quality of acting is variable , the script is suspect and everything about Maslin Beach is cheap , the lack of continuity is a positive boon . In fact , there is something about this film ( not the nudity ) that I find appealing . It is hard to define what it is , but it could be something to do with its bluntness , and downright ' Aussie ' attitude to carnal matters . The camera work in Maslin Beach deserves a mention . Sometimes it is very good , with some stunning static shots and ' pans ' of the beach , cliffs and a sunset . As nudity is a major factor in this film , framing is an important aspect of the camera work . There is no sense of gratuity in the framing , meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not dwell on ' private ' body parts . This helps to ease any sense of viewer discomfort from being within the subject 's ' personal space ' , and makes the film more tasteful . Not an easy task , given the location for filming . Maslin Beach is neither a ' skin flick ' for post-pubescent , testosterone charged males , nor a ' Mills and Boon ' romance for under-appreciated women . Maslin Beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre . The actors are not ' attractive ' in the Baywatch sense , and are just ' normal ' people that you would see on the beach anywhere . It does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a tourism advertisement , other than perhaps to Naturists . Apart from the Australian accent , the filming could have been in any sunny country . What makes this film distinctly Australian is the fact that it is pointless ( cinema verite ? ) , and only Australian Cinema , and other medium sized National Cinemas , could consider such a rash option . At the same time , these medium sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the quest for identity , and a ' flop ' is not going to damage their reputation too much . It is always possible , given that Maslin Beach is now a collector 's item , that the film might become internationally popular , but it is very unlikely . During this critique , I have been sounding highly negative , at times , about Maslin Beach . This is not the real position , as I found the film very easy to watch . I enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people ( and problems ) . The problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday , and a little low on spectacle . This does it no harm in my view , and I wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this . There is a connection here with the cinemas of Europe , and with French film in particular . They rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes , but with the everyday . Hollywood is in direct opposition to this , and rides the crest of the hyper-real action / drama / angst wave . The pace too , is much faster in Hollywood , but it is not reality . Maslin Beach is not exactly ' Jacques Tati ' either , but it is on the right track , even if it does ignore issues of multi culturalism , equality , gender orientation and so on , that are of such importance in current cinema . I am sure that you will either love or hate this film , with little room for a middle ground .  
1	  " De vierde man " ( The Fourth Man , 1984 ) is considered one of the best European pycho thrillers of the eighties . This last work of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before he moved to Hollywood to become a big star with movies like " Total Recall " , " Basic Instinct " and " Starship Troopers " is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author ( Jeroen Krabbe ) going to the seaside for recovering . There he meets a mysterious femme fatale ( Renee Soultendieck ) and starts a fatal love affair with her . He becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstances .. " De vierde man " is much influenced by the old Hollywood film noire and the psycho thrillers of Alfred Hitchcock and Orson Wells . It takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere , and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward . The suspense is sometimes nearly unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of Italian cult director Dario Argento . The cast is also outstanding , especially Krabbe 's performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career ( " The Living Daylights " , " The Fugitive " ) . If you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on TV , video or DVD , don't miss it !  
0	  This is a story of a Jewish dysfunctional family . The parents have divorced and mom remains back east in the house . The father , Murray Abromowitz , moves with his children to California , and moves around Beverly Hills so that his children can get the best education possible . Things really become funny when Marisa Tomei , Murray 's niece , comes to lives with the group . The film deals with the various adventures of the family complicated by the drug scene of the affluent neighborhood . Jessica Walter costars as a woman who wants Murray to move in with her since she wants a companion . Carl Reiner and Rita Moreno come in towards the end . They play Murray 's brother and sister-in-law respectively ; they 're also the parents of Tomei . In front of the children , Reiner lets loose reminding Murray that he has been paying the bills for them all along . The film ends on a sour note as the embarrassed family moves out of their fancy digs and take to riding around Beverly Hills in their car . I guess the film is promoting independence and some good old self-esteem .  
0	  * SPOILERS * Slow as molasses mummy movie involving this expiation in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt that has to be aborted in order to keep the native population , who are at the time revolting against British rule , from finding out about it . Given the task of getting to this archaeological dig by his superiors British Capt . Storm , Mark Dana , together with a couple of British soldiers and Mrs. Sylvia Quentin , Diane Brewster , the wife of the head man at the dig Robert Quentin , George N. Neise , make their way to the unearthed mummy 's tomb . On the way there Capt . Storm Sylvia and his men run into this desert-like princess Simira , Ziva Rodann . Simira seems to be superhuman in her ability to withstand the rigors of desert life , she doesn't drink water or get tired , but also knows just what Capt . Storm & Co . are looking for and warns him and his group to stay as far away from the dig , Pharaoh 's Ra Ha Tet tomb , as possible . At Ra Ha Tet 's burial chamber Robert Quentin and his crew of archeologist 's together with his Egyptin guide Simira 's brother Numar , Alvaro Guillot , already opened his tomb before Capt . Storm can get there to stop them . Quentin violated Ra Ha Tet 's body by having Dr. Farrady , Guy Prescott , cut his bandages . This action on Robert 's and Dr. Farrady 's part has Numar faint dead in his tracks . It later turns out that Numar somehow was possessed by Ra Ha Tet 's spirit or soul who took over his body and caused him to age , at the rate of 500 years per hour , to become himself a 3,000 year-old mummy . The movie has Numar dressed in what looks like a pair of pajamas slinking around Ra Ha Tet 's tomb and it 's surroundings attacking and sucking out the blood in order to survive , like a vampire , of anyone man or animal that he comes in contact with . This blood-sucking adventure by Numar , with him later losing his right arm , goes on for some time until the by now crazed Quentin trying to find the entrance , you in fact thought that he already found it , to Ra Ha Tet 's tomb get 's himself killed is an indoor rock slide . We learn at the end of the movie that Numar , to absolutely no one 's surprise , is actually Ra Ha Tet reincarnated into another , some 3,000 years later , person or life . Numar 's sister the mysterious and sexy Simira is not only Ra Ha Tet 's sister , since him and Numar are really one and the same person , but also the Egyptian Cat Goddess Babesti ! Also not that hard to figure out . With Numar / Ra Ha Tet back in his tomb and all the deaths , due the the Pharaoh 's Curse , now at an end Capt . Storm Sylvia and whatever is left of his men and the late Robert Quentin 's archaeological expedition trek their way back to Cairo and modern , this in 1902 , civilization . The survivors of Pharaoh Ra Ha Tet Curse keep what they found , and unearthed , only to themselves since no one would believe them anyway .  
0	  This film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized . There are two routes to take in horror films : either you don't really explain what 's going on ( or who the killer is , like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre ) or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained ( Halloween could potentially be an example of this ) . Unfortunately , Creep fails in this area . I see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for Craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation . No character is fully realized , although the circular nature of Kate 's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story . In the end , this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film-making that drag down the film . This film will go down as another example of a film ( as most are ) that could be so much better even though it would never be great . The only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting : the characters , story , direction , and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift . Creep does serve a purpose as a mindless , silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment , but sadly , that 's about it ..  
1	  This comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail . There have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven't come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one . This is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film . At first , the action seems rather off-the-wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves , even if grudgingly , through each other . Rogers ' heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and Sheedy 's angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them . You will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it 's in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread . Hopefully audiences will get to see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt .  
0	  There have been some funny movies about spirits to come out of Hollywood . Cary Grant was an angel in " The Bishop 's Wife " ( 1947 ) . Of course the best were the Topper movies in the late ' 30s-early ' 40s . And , more recently , Warren Beatty 's " Heaven Can Wait " ( 1978 ) , which was a remake of 1941 's " Here Comes Mr. Jordan . " These were well-written , funny , entertaining comedies , all of which centered around supernatural creatures like ghosts and angels . Now comes writer-director Jeff Lowell , making his feature film debut with a story of an unlikable , bitchy young woman , Kate ( Eva Longoria Parker ) , who gets killed on her wedding day and then comes back to harass the fledgling spiritualist , Ashley ( Lake Bell ) who is falling for Kate 's fiancé , Henry ( Paul Rudd ) . One thing that is clear at the outset : Longoria Parker is no Constance Bennett ( Marion Kerby in the first two " Topper " films ) , who is the standard against whom all female ghosts are measured . There is a line right at the beginning when Henry 's sister , Chloe ( Lindsay Sloane ) tells Henry , " You don't smile . " That aptly described my situation throughout this film . The main problem with the film is that the script just isn't very funny . But it 's made worse by Longoria Parker 's presence that just rubbed me the wrong way every time she appeared on the screen . Just to start out with , compounding her lack of comedic talent , she is covered with so much pancake makeup , who knows what she really looks like ? Kate gets killed while setting up for her wedding by a falling frozen statue . She 's so unreasonable that the angel who instructs her about what her afterlife is about walks out on her ( well , she actually just fades out ) , so Kate finds herself back on earth as a ghost without knowing what her mission is . Chloe wants Henry to snap out of the funk into which he has naturally descended after Kate 's death ( from what I saw of Kate , he should have felt a wonderful relief ) , so she introduces him to Ashley , who really doesn't know what she 's doing as a spiritualist ( she is also a cateress to make ends meet ) , to see if she can get Henry back in touch with Kate . There 's a lot of meshugaas that goes on . The vacuity of the film is epitomized by a " B " story revolving around Ashley 's assistant , Dan ( Jason Biggs ) . This is thrown in near the end , but the way Ashley handles it indicates that she 's as much of a boob as Kate . Since Dan is apparently attracted to both of these severely flawed women , he deserves whatever he gets . Eventually Kate appears to Ashley and the fun should begin . It doesn't , and more 's the pity because in other hands this could have been pretty funny . As it is , Norman Z. McLeod , Constance Bennett , Roland Young , Alan Mowbray , and Co . must be turning over in their graves to see this is what their brilliance in the first two " Topper " films has wrought .  
0	  The Golden Era of Disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s . This show Quack Pack shouldn't even be considered a DuckTales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with DuckTales . It 's about a teen-aged Huey , Dewey and Louie as they make trouble for their uncle Donald and talk in hip-hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in DuckTales . I prefer the little adventurous nephews from DuckTales . There are humans in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg . There 's no references of Scrooge McDuck . The stories are repetitive , the plot is boring but the animation is good . If you want lots of slapstick humor , I recommend this to you . If you want a better Disney show watch " Darkwing Duck " or " DuckTales " .  
0	  I would rather have 20 root canals than go through this film again . The Prince of Annoying , Myles Berkowitz , has wasted nearly two hours of my life with this piece of cynical pseudo-cool . The only amusing thing in this whole mess is Mr. Samaha 's obnoxious off camera patter about tits and ass . Berkowitz takes a great concept and grinds it into the dust . It is choppy and badly done , in an apparent effort to make it seem edgy or funny . It is neither . I seldom feel that a movie was a waste of film ( or tape ) , but this one qualifies for that distinction . If a date suggests seeing this film , run .  
1	  " Mechenosets " is one of the most beautiful romantic movies I 've ever seen . The name of the film can be translated in English as " the sword-bearer " . The main hero ( Sasha ) was born with one exceptional ability : he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword which emerges from under the skin in his hand . At first side he can seem one more foolish superhero from the senseless movie about unreal events and feelings . But it is not about Mechenosets . He hardly can be even called the anti-hero . I think he is just a person who lost the purport in his life and faith in good , justice and love . In his life he has never met someone who could understand and love him ( except his mother ) . Every his step is stained with blood ; he takes revenge on everybody for his gift which became a damnation for him . And suddenly he meets her . She doesn't need the idle talks and explanations . She loves him for what he is . She doesn't care what he did . The fact that he 's next to her is more important than anything else . But soon she finds out his secret : he kills two people ( her ex-boyfriend and his bodyguard ) to protect her before her very eyes . Even after that she couldn't escape her feelings . They try to run but it 's hart to hide . Finally they have a serious car accident . He is caged ; she is in a mental hospital . They don't know anything about each other , but she believes that he 'll save her . He surmounts a lot of obstacles but finally finds her . They run again but they aren't invulnerable . She is wounded , she needs a rest , but police almost catch them . He doesn't know what to do , they drive into a corner , and then his sword begins to cut down trees , helicopter around them , but there is no need for it , because she is already dead in his arms , and he is the lonely person in the whole world again .  
0	  Virgin is selected to marry rich guy . Rich guy urinates . Woman on boat likes sailor . Sailor urinates . Virgin attends gross-out commune dinner . Man urinates on dinner table . Boatwoman does strip tease for little boys . Man pretending to be baby urinates . There is an underlying theme here . Makavejev is trying to say that he is pi$ed off at the world . To say that this is a bizarre movie is an understatement . To justify the title , there is a scene where Laure , who hardly speaks ten lines the whole movie , bathes in chocolate syrup . It is a sweet scene indeed but the rest of the movie leaves a bad taste in one 's mouth unless one happens to share the director 's fetishes .  
1	  " La Bête " by Walerian Borowczyk is based on the short story " Lokis " written by Prosper Merimée . Lucy Broadhurst ( Lisabeth Hummel ) , an American heiress betrothed to the son of an impoverished Marquis , arrives at the family 's crumbling château and learns of a mythical ursine beast purported to prowl the nearby forest . It is fabled that a former lady of the house ( Sirpa Lane ) once engaged in perverse sex with the creature and Lucy finds herself consumed by dreams of the incident . " The Beast " is an art-house mix of surreal horror , explicit sleaze and porno . There 's implied bestiality , assault and perversion in the priesthood , copious fake ejaculate smeared on bared breasts , masturbation with a rose and , most graphic of all , the eponymous beast toying with incredibly big phallus . Still this genuinely erotic film is wonderfully photographed and tasteless . The women here are stunningly beautiful and they are naked most of the time . Overall " La Bête " is a visual feast . Whether it be from the fetishistic attention to detail , or the visual motifs pregnant with information , Borowczyk 's masterpiece should be watched with care and attention . A must-see for fans of European cult cinema .  
0	  There is this girl and she 's running in the woods but she ends up at this woman 's clinic and she wants an abortion . Her daddy is outside in a van and he is all angry about it . The whole episode takes place in and outside of this abortion clinic . I 'm not really pro-choice but I wanted the choice to kill this episode . I was laughing when I saw the baby come out and it went into the corner . The part where they were doing the ultra sound was pretty funny too . I was really feeling sorry for the poor dad in this episode . He just wanted to protect his daughter and I couldn't really blame him for what he did . I don't know what happened to him at the end or what happened to the other father and daughter in the waiting room . I was just laughing too hard and I would suggest watching " Pick me up " instead of this episode . It wasn't the worst episode but it wasn't that great .  
1	  I really like this movie because in Australia , Chinese movies like these never get shown during prime time . I must say this is one of the best serious movies ever , which outlines the difference between the Hong Kong people , and mainland Chinese . It really shows that there 's discomfort between the two , but can only get better as HK are learning Mandarin . It also showed me how in mainland China the indie rock scene exists , and that Chinese people do know how to strum the guitar and get the house funking ! Whoever said China isn't ready for rock music ? Daniel Wu is absolutely superb , with his clean and crisp voice , honest acting , and a total chick magnet . I recommend this movie to those who don't know much about Asian people to cleanse themselves from the typical Western stereotypes , and people who just love Chinese / Asian cinema like myself . Check it out !  
0	  I 've been scolded and scorned by fellow Christians for stating my disappointment with this movie . I get hounded by statements like these : " I can't believe you didn't like it ! It was made totally by Christians ! " " Everyone donated their time and no one was paid for the movie ! It was made by a church and not Hollywood . We should spend our money on movies like this ! They only used $ 100,000 to make the film . " " This is by a real church and Christian school in Georgia ! A preacher wrote and directed it . " So , apparently , the reason I should love this movie is simply because of the way it was made and the minimum amount of money used to make it and that is was made by Christians . That is all that is needed for me to love the movie . Look , I got the movie without knowing ANYTHING about the background of the film . I had never heard of it and had no idea - other than football - what it was about . I watched it like I watch any other movie and was disappointed . I was disappointed in the lousy editing and lame script . I was VERY disappointed on the resolution after the climax . Don't worry . There have been other cheap movies and other EXPENSIVELY made movies that have earned less respect from me . It isn't about the making of the movie . It is the end product . The writer acknowledges that God doesn't say " yes " to everything we pray for in the way we want , but he wanted to show by having faith , God changes our lives . That is true . However , God can change our lives and we 're still infertile . God can change our lives and we don't get a raise from our job . God can change our lives and our car is still an old jalopy . God can change our lives and our house is still stinky . Why didn't he portray that in the movie ? Others voiced their concern to the writer / director over the matter , but apparently , he was defensive . I did not think the acting was horrible nor many of the landscape shots . I like the idea of going to God and recognizing His awesome power and our weakness . The writing and directing were very weak . It is easy to distinguish this because many of the characters have no development . All we really get from the coach 's wife is she is not pregnant ( well , until the end of the movie ) . It seems as if there was only ball player that had the potential to have an interesting character and that was chopped to bits into " I have a cripple father and I can't play football well , but I 'll kick the winning field goal even though I 've never kicked a real field goal before . " Another problem was the Christian school itself . Umm , I have worked for two Christian schools , went to one myself , and have had many nieces and nephews in other Christian schools . All in all , I 've had some pretty close connections with about ten different ones . NONE of the problems that I have seen in ALL of these schools were addressed . I saw this as totally surreal in the movie about their school and wished they had shown the human factor . It would have been nice to see a dose of reality and how God can work . I will close by stating that every work - either written or drawn or played on an instrument - shares the artist 's world view . The world view that was shown to me in this movie consists of " People who pray the right way win ball games , get new cars , conceive when they couldn't , get a raise , and get their house fixed - all within a short time span . " I know . I should LOVE the movie simply due to the sincerity of the people who made it . I think I should love the movie because it was well done and for no other reason .  
0	  Omen IV : The Awakening starts at the ' St . Frances Orphanage ' where husband & wife Karen ( Faye Grant ) & Gene York ( Michael Woods ) are given a baby girl by Sister Yvonne ( Megan Leitch ) who they have adopted , they name her Delia . At first things go well but as the years pass & Delia ( Asia Vieria ) grows up Karen becomes suspicious of her as death & disaster follows her , Karen is convinced that she is evil itself . Karen then finds out that she is pregnant but discovers a sinister plot to use her as a surrogate mother for th next Antichrist & gets a shock when she finds out who Delia 's real father was .. Originally to be directed by Dominique Othenin-Girard who either quit or was sacked & was replaced by Jorge Montesi who completed the film although why he bothered is anyone 's guess as Omen IV : The Awakening is absolutely terrible & a disgrace when compared to it illustrious predecessors . The script by Brian Taggert is hilariously bad , I 'm not sure whether this nonsense actually looked good as the written word on a piece of paper but there are so many things wrong with it that I find even that hard to believe . As a serious film Omen IV : The AWakening falls flat on it 's face & it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof , I mean the scene towards the end when the Detective comes face-to-face with a bunch of zombie carol singers who are singing an ominous Gothic song has to be seen to be believed & I thought it was absolutely hilarious & ridiculous in equal measure . Then there 's the pointless difference between this & the other Omen films in that this time it 's a young girl , the question I ask here is why ? Seriously , why ? There 's no reason at all & isn't used to any effect at all anyway . Then of course there 's the stupid twist at the end which claims Delia has been keeping her brother 's embryo inside herself & that in a sinister conspiracy involving a group of Satan worshippers it has been implanted in Karen so she can give birth to the Antichrist is moronic & comes across as just plain daft . At first it has a certain entertainment value in how bad it is but the unintentional hilarity gives way to complete boredom sooner rather than later . It 's obviously impossible to know how much of Omen IV : The Awakening was directed by Girard & Montesi but you can sort of tell all was not well behind the camera as it 's a shabby , cheap looking poorly made film which was actually made-for-TV & it shows with the bland , flat & unimaginative cinematography & production design . Then there 's the total lack of scares , atmosphere , tension & gore which are the main elements that made the previous Omen films so effective . The budget must have been pretty low & the film looks like it was . The best most stylish thing about Omen IV : The Awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as Delia walks away into the distance to reveal a crucifix shaped cross made by two overlapping path 's but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything . I have to mention the music which sounds awful , more suited to a comedy & is very inappropriate sounding . The acting is alright at best but as usual the kid annoys . Omen IV : The Awakening is rubbish , it 's a totally ridiculous film that tries to be serious & just ends up coming across as stupid . The change of director 's probably didn't help either , that 's still not a excuse though . The last Omen film to date following the original The Omen ( 1976 ) , Damien : Omen II ( 1978 ) & The Final Conflict ( 1981 ) all of which are far superior to this .  
1	  " The Thief of Bagdad " is impressive in the shape of the evil magician Jaffar ( Conrad Veidt ) . He plots with lies and magic spells to obtain the kingdom from its rightful ruler the young King Ahmad , and a gorgeous princess from her father .. He falls victim in the end , as all tyrants do ( in books and legends ) to love and of the common man whom he ignored , here embodied by the little thief ( Sabu ) . The armies of good and evil , black and white , are superbly realized in both visual and literary terms .. The script is poetic , simply and very beautiful .. The costumes of the magician and his men rising and falling like the wings of black birds , attacking suddenly in the night to inflict destruction and create terror .. The radiant hero wears white turbans and robes , and his princess is dressed in pinks and pale blues .. For spectacular scenes it matched all that had gone before , while through its use of color , it brought to life a world such as had not seemed possible before .. With flying carpet and flying white horse , with a giant genie ( excellently played by Rex Ingram ) , with evil wizards , and with the good acting of Sabu and Veidt , " The Thief of Bagdad " captures the quality and true atmosphere of the Arabian Nights .. The 1940 version remains the screen 's finest fairy tale !

1	  We all create our own reality , or do we ? That is the core question behind this highly original and masterfully crafted examination of the illusionary nature of reality . Blending Eastern and Buddhist philosophies with the visual chicanery of M.C. Escher , this fascinating treatise manages to take on the rather cerebral question of ` Who are we and what is our place in the universe ? ' , and turn it into a captivating and fun-filled 100 minutes . The film centers on Bart , a writer struggling with his screenplay , ` The Sea That Thinks . ' As he sits at his computer , the work begins to unfold as nothing more than a description of his sitting at the computer , writing the screenplay . Before long he is stuck in a whirling conundrum in which everything he writes becomes reality . Director Gert de Graaff approaches his subject with an impish sense of humor and dazzles the viewer with a series of astounding visual tricks that confront the nature and validity of our perception . Ultimately , de Graaff 's film challenges the audience at several levels to question whether anything we see or touch or taste is really what it appears to be , or whether our entire understanding of the universe and our place in it is merely a trick played on us by our senses . Note : AFTER you 've seen the movie , check out the film 's entertaining web site . ( Dutch with English subtitles ) - Eric Moore

1	  I vaugely recall seeing this when I was 3 years old , then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon . Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and since I was then able to comprehend things better , I thought it was a good movie then . Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago ( June 2006 ) when I re-re discovered it thanks to some internet articles / video clips and it 's just not the same movie . I 'm sure it 's still good with the kids , but to us 20-30 somethings it 's definitely got " Cult Status " written all over it . It 's a shame that the original production went through a painful process ; if Fox gave it enough time it would probably be more recognized in the public eye today . Maybe if they were to remake it with a totally different story and an all star voice cast it could be , but that 's for Fox to decide . I 'm rambling here , I know . I Still think it 's a great film , but it could be better than great .  
1	  This is one of those movies - like Dave , American Dreamer and Local Hero - that holds a viewer 's interest time and again . Lightweight movies seldom win Oscars , but whoever did the casting for Soapdish deserves one . Even after one has seen the movie and knows what is coming , it 's still enjoyable to watch how the various plot facets develop . True , all the drama is melodrama ; but that 's entirely fitting for a movie with a soap opera background . My favorite line comes from Whoopi Goldberg : " Now why can't I write sh * t like that ? " I think it 's unfortunate that the TV and website censors insist on all this unnecessary sanitation .  
1	  I was absolutely blown away by John Cassavetes 's Opening Night . It 's the first movie of his that I 've seen that seems to be on a bigger scale , thus it feels more mainstream , but it still doesn't feel as if he grounded himself any more than he has in his previous films . That is perhaps what makes it so intense . There is also something undoubtedly cathartic about watching this movie . It 's about what in fact Cassavetes has made a staple of his career , an ideal that he has expressed behind the camera throughout his career as a director and is here expressing it in front . Rowlands 's character , middle-aged stage actress Myrtle Gordon , cannot bring herself to play her role in the upcoming production as written so she uncalculatedly follows impulse after impulse , resulting in what appears to be chaos on stage , until she finds the right one . It 's a daringly abstract premise . This is a movie that does not fail to capture the innate steering that one goes through during an emotional cleansing . No one understands why Myrtle does many of the things she does , and it is seen and even portrayed as something destructive , yet it just might be the best thing for her . It may be a cleansing rather than a breakdown . A withdrawal , a cocoon , a rebellion , it all culminates into a meltdown . Cassavetes gives her character a brutally real touch , which is that early on , she is ardently arguing that she has nothing in common with her character , yet she is in quiet but emotionally corroding fear that the opposite is true . The last scene , the climactic performance that Myrtle shares with a character painfully estranged from her who is acting with her , is one of the most interesting , hilarious , hard-hitting , enlightening , and enjoyable moments I 've ever seen in a movie .  
1	  This movie re-wrote film history in every way . No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie , because it transcends criticism . Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it . It is an extremely beautiful movie , and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again . I 've seen it more times than I care to count , and I still become transfixed every time , with a feeling which is hard to describe . One for the ages .  
1	  I love Korean films because they have the ability to really ( quiet eerily really ) capture real life . I tend to watch Korean movies just for that reason alone . I 've seen this directors other movies before . The one that comes closest to the feelings I got from this is Oasis and another awesome film called This Charming Girl . However , my title summary is supposed to be from a Chrstian perspective so I 'll just start doing that instead of just showering it with praise . For a non Christian perspective Director Chang-dong Lee has captured an unbiased and almost eerily real portrayal of a modern Protestant church ( regardless of denomination ) warts and all . I 've always been waiting for a Christian film that truly portrays the darker recesses of church life . Because Christian films tend to speak in a language that is different to those they want to share their faith to . Many films with religious undertones , though having good motives , tend to just have the resonance of a Disney film or after school special . They need to show life as it is . Real people curse , real people lust , real people fall . And though Christians believe that salvation is available to those that seek it , we are still challenged by the everyday horrors of this life . And Do-yeon Jeon 's character is a totally honest and almost brutal portrayal of a woman that found God , but because of life 's bitter realities , loses that love for Him she once had . She doesn't deny God exists . It is just that she refuses to accept to live with the idea that He is an all loving and forgiving God . In her decent to the edges of morality and madness , her character asks questions that are in the mind of every one , religious or not . " If God is Love , why does He allow such terrible things to happen ? " This film doesn't answer that , rightly so . And I believe the last 10 minutes of the film , though open to interpretation , leaves us with a hopeful future for our main character and brings the idea of " secret sunshine " full circle . I don't believe for a second that this film tried to be religious or had in any way tried and set out to be that . There in lies the reason why it worked even more . It 's real , it 's honest . And because of that , it is by far the best summation of a real Christian life I have seen on film .  
1	  " Hatred of a Minute " is a hauntingly beautiful film . A psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer , Eric Seaver . Strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a " must see " for any film student or horror fan . The realness of the story and the human side of Eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies . Some shout outs to the film 's producer , Bruce Campbell as well as to the film " The Evil Dead " add some humor for anyone that knows the genre .  
1	  The great Vincent Price has done many fantastic Horror films , some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all-time . Price 's greatest achievements were doubtlessly his films in the 60s , with films such as Roger Corman 's brilliant Poe-cycle ( still the greatest Horror cycle of all-time ) , Michael Reeves ' " Witchfinder General " ( 1968 ) or Ubaldo Ragona 's " The Last Man on Earth " ( 1964 ) marking the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man 's career . The films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal Horror icon he is , however date back to the 50s , with " House of Wax " ( 1953 ) marking his rise to stardom . " The Mad Magician " of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor . This is not to say , however , that this film isn't an original , delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself . As the lines above may suggest , Vincent Price is my favorite actor , and , while I personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in , none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem . Price stars as Don Galico ( aka . Galico the Great ) , an underrated master magician and inventor of magic devices , whose boss , a sleazy businessman , stole his wife ( Eva Gabor ) from him . When the boss takes away one of Galico 's ingenious inventions and gives it to his rival , The Great Rinaldi ( John Emery ) , Galico snaps , and a murderous spree of revenge begins .. Don't we love Vincent Price when he 's out for revenge ? Some of his most famous and greatest films such as " The Abominable Dr. Phibes " ( 1971 ) or " Theater of Blood " ( 1973 ) were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders , and this earlier film in his Horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as Vincent Price does . This film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for Price , who , as always , delivers a brilliant performance , and guarantees 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every Horror fan . Another must-see for my fellow Price fans .  
1	  There are enough sad stories about women and their oppression by religious , political and societal means . Not to diminish the films and stories about genital mutilation and reproductive rights , as well as wage inequality , and marginalization in society , all in the name of Allah or God or some other ridiculous justification , but sometimes it is helpful to just take another approach and shed some light on the subject . The setting is the 2006 match between Iran and Bahrain to qualify for the World Cup . Passions are high and several women try to disguise themselves as men to get into the match . The women who were caught ( Played by Sima Mobarak-Shahi , Shayesteh Irani , Ayda Sadeqi , Golnaz Farmani , and Mahnaz Zabihi ) and detained for prosecution provided a funny and illuminating glimpse into the customs of this country and , most likely , all Muslim countries . Their interaction with the Iranian soldiers who were guarding and transporting them , both city and villagers , and the father who was looking for his daughter provided some hilarious moments as we thought about why they have such unwritten rules . It is mainly about a paternalistic society that feels it has to save it 's women from the crude behavior of it 's men . Rather than educating the male population , they deny privilege and rights to the women . Seeing the changes in the soldiers responsible and the reflection of Iranian society , it is nos surprise this film will not get any play in Iran . But Jafar Panahi has a winner on his hands for those able to see it .  
0	  The book that this movie is based on seriously changed my life . But saying this movie was a disappointment is an understatement . The acting , directing , cinematography , and storyline were all horrible . I would never recommend this movie to anyone . I 've told countless people about the book but will now be telling them all that they should definitely not see the movie ! I did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly , but they have left out too many key components of the book . The movie tried , but failed , to deliver a powerful and inspiring message and only demeaned the central theme of the prophecy . While putting myself in the position who had not read the book , I saw the Celestine Prophecy as a bunch of hoaxy B.S. I am thoroughly disappointed with Redfield for the way this movie turned out .  
0	  Wow . This is really not that good . I would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good .. it is , but it is nothing special . The movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies . * / *  
1	  It 's a cooking competition show , Americanized . It 's not going to be the Japanese version . The show is great . I could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch .. From the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman . Truly a good way to spend some time watching TV . You could critique the show for having guests like Marc Ecko as a judge .. But .. Meh . It 's entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize . Oh yeah and I 'm bitter John Besh isn't the new Iron Chef .. Ala Cuisine !  
0	  I remember watching this movie when I was young , but could not recall the title to it then going through horror movies I find it and think to myself " that is the title ? " This movie is a kind of combination disaster film / insect attack film with fewer notable stars in it . It is also somewhat boring too , as it has that television vibe to it where you can see the movie fade out for commercials and such . The plot has this sort of resort being invaded by ants . I think they were a bit disturbed by construction or something going on nearby , but do not quote me on that . The most memorable ant attack for me in the whole flick was the first one involving the kid who falls into the swimming pool after being swarmed and of course Summers attack scene too . What else stands out in this one is the very goofy ending where the survivors use cardboard tubes to breath through . In the end though like most television movies this movie is very tame and not very scary in the least unless you panic at the sight of ants .  
1	  This is Not a Love Song . My one word summary of this film would be ` Excellent ' . It probably won't appeal to the mass movie watching public  it 's a film that forces you to participate . You observe , think , and question . Comparisons could be made with Deliverance ( Topic / Theme ) and perhaps with The Blair Witch Project for overall filming style . However this film stands unique against both . The cinematography effects ( solarisation , freeze frame , blur etc ) have been seen before but they are used most effectively in this film to underpin the natural tension of the story . Acting is raw , menacing and utterly believable . The real theme of the film is about friendship ; the title really gives the game away . It 's probably not the kind of friendship that most of us have experienced or indeed would want to . It is a love song .  
1	  What an amazing film . With very little dialogue , the whole story is told with glances and body language . Very involving almost voyeuristic . My only gripe is that it has not been released on video in Australia and is therefore only available on TV . What a waste .  
1	  Any child old enough to sit up in front of a screen will be absolutely captivated by the beautifully drawn images and wonderful music in this heartfelt and humorous re-write of the Grimms ' fairytale . They 'll be singing ' Bibbity-Bobbity-Boo ' before they can even formulate a complete sentence and will continue singing it till their dying days . It is a classic for all children , especially those adults who are young at heart .  
0	  Really bad movie , the story is too simple and predictable and poor acting as a complement . This vampire 's hunter story is the worst that i have seen so far , Derek Bliss ( Jon Bon Jovi ) , travels to Mexico in search for some blood suckers ! , he use some interesting weapons ( but nothing compared to Blade ) , and is part of some Van Helsig vampire 's hunters net ? , OK , but he work alone . He 's assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight ( is almost a sequel of Vampires ( 1998 ) directed by John Carpenter and starred by James Woods ) , Derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends : Sancho ( Diego Luna , really bad acting also ) a teenager without experience , Father Rodrigo ( Cristian De la Fuente ) a catholic priest , Zoey ( Natasha Wagner ) a particular vampire and Ray Collins ( Darius McCrary ) another expert vampire hunter . So obviously in this adventure he isn't alone . You can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor ( Jon Bon Jovi ) ; is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to James Woods , and then , if you watch the film ( i don't recommend this part ) , you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories , totally predictable , with terrible acting performances , really bad special effects and incoherent events ! . I deeply recommend not to see this film ! , rent another movie , see another channel , go out with your friends , etc . 3/10  
0	  The premise of the film is that Thomas Archer 's son was murdered and his wife was brutalized - and he is given a chance at revenge when ( after Post Traumatic Stress Disorder therapy ) , he is put in a room with a man strapped to a chair and told this was the culprit . He is given a large table of implements with which to offer retribution : drills , bats , nails , sledgehammers , torches , whatever you can think of that someone could possibly want to use to physically hurt another human being . We go way too many scenes of torture before we figure out that The Man Archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime . The two then create an uncomfortable alliance ; who put them in this situation and why . Well , when all is said and done , we don't really care ..  
1	  After watching the rather sloppy WW1 spy thriller , Madam Lili ( 1969 ) starring Julie Andrews on tv this afternoon , I suddenly thought I had seen a far superior WW1 spy thriller . All I could remember was that it was produced by Dino De Laurentis . It only took a short search on IMDB to find Fraulein Doktor . Once I recognised the title the memories came flooding back . It is , for its time , a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of Kitchener and the German offensives of 1918 . It also has a female spy who is much more believable than Julie Andrews ! As with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks . If you have an interest in war films and particularly WW1 it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity .  
1	  I have to admit to enjoying bad movies . I love them I watch all of them . Horror especially . My friends and I all gather after a hard week at school and work , rent some crazy tapes , order a pizza and have a blast . One of the ones we got at Hollywood Video , was this one , Zombie Bloodbath . This one had a great box , so I was expecting less than usual . The story is about a housing project that is built over a nuclear facility that has had the above-ground layers bulldozed , and the other underground layers are simply covered up . The inhabitants of this neighborhood find the covered up facility when some kids fall into a hole inside a cave . This wakes up some zombies . From this point on , it 's chunk-city . The gore effects and action never stop until the end credits roll . OK , it 's not great art , but this one , with it 's in-joke dialogue and over-the-top gruesome stuff was our favorite of the evening . Actually , it was one of the best " party tapes " I have ever had the pleasure of watching . And you could tell it was done on no money , with a bunch of crazy people . There are hundreds of zombies , and the Director looks like Brendan Frazer ( he has a cameo ) and it is just a wild trip .  
1	  Way , way back in the 1980s , long before NAFTA was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities , the United States and Japan were at each other 's throat in the world manufacturing race . Remember sayings like ' Union Yes ! , ' ' the Japanese are taking this country over , ' and ' Americans are lazy ? ' As the Reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace , director Ron Howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash ' Gung Ho , ' which drew over $ 36 million in U.S. box office receipts . While in many ways dated , Howard 's tongue-in-cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life today . ' Gung Ho ' focuses on Hunt Stevenson ( Michael Keaton ) , the automakers union rep from Hadleyville , a small , depressed town in the foothills of Pennsylvania . Stevenson has been asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo ( similar to real-life Toyota ) , which is considering a U.S. operation at the town 's empty plant . With hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse , Assan decides to move in and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line . The 112 minutes of ' Gung Ho ' is a humorous look at these two sides , with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered : on one hand , an American workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism ; on the other hand , Japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self-worth . In Stevenson , we find an American working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings . With the survival of his workers ' jobs and most of Hadleyville on the line , Stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance , although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble . Besides answering to the heads of Assan , we witness a delicate balancing act between Stevenson and his fellow union members , many of whom he grew up with . This includes Buster ( George Wendt ) , Willie ( John Turturro ) , and Paul ( Clint Howard , Ron 's brother ) . The Japanese cast is headed by Gedde Watanabe , also known for ' Sixteen Candles ' and ' Volunteers . ' Watanabe plays Kazihiro , the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for American life . He is constantly shadowed by Saito ( Sab Shimono ) , the nephew of Assan 's CEO who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order . While given a light touch , these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the Japanese working culture . With Hunt Stevenson dominating the script , Michael Keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work . ' Gung Ho ' is indeed a slam-dunk success for Keaton , who also teamed with Ron Howard in 1994 's ' The Paper . ' He made this film during a string of lighter roles that included ' Mr. Mom , ' ' Beetle Juice , ' and ' The Dream Team ' before venturing into ' Batman , ' ' One Good Cop , ' and ' My Life . ' It 's also hard not to like Gedde Watanabe 's performance as the odd man out , who first wears Japanese ribbons of shame before teaming up with Stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unit . The supporting cast is top-notch , including Wendt , Turturro , Shimono , and Soh Yamamura as Assan CEO Sakamoto . Mimi Rogers supplies a romantic interest as Audrey , Hunt 's girlfriend . Edwin Blum , Lowell Ganz , and Babaloo Mandel teamed up for Gung Ho 's solid writing . The incidental music , which received a BMI Film Music Award , was composed by Thomas Newman . Gung Ho 's soundtrack songs are wall-to-wall 80s , including ' Don't Get Me Wrong , ' ' Tuff Enuff , ' and ' Working Class Man . ' The success of ' Gung Ho ' actually led to a short-lived TV series on ABC . While more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago , Ron Howard 's film still has its comic value . It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount Widescreen Collection and is a tad short-changed . Audio options are provided in English 5.1 surround , English Dolby surround , and French ' dubbing , ' but subtitles are in English only . There are no extras , not even the theatrical trailer . On the plus side , Paramount 's digital transfer is quite good , with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound . While a few extras would have been helpful - especially that ' Gung Ho ' was a box office success - there 's little to complain about the film presentation itself . * out of 4

0	  ( spoilers ) Wow , this is a bad one . I did a double take when watching an old Star Trek episode the other day-it was the one where everyone gets infected with that space sickness and then go a bit nuts-and there was Stewart Moss , a . k . a the unlikable ' hero ' of It Lives by Night ! He played the first crewmember infected , who dies from terminal depression . All I could think was that he 'd watched his own movie too many times , that 's what caused the depression . This movie is full of truly unlikable people . There is no redeeming character in the film , not one . It 's very hard to feel bad about Dr. Beck 's turning into a bat ( or whatever he actually turned into ) , because you just don't like him . And you don't like his shrill , bony wife , or the nasty sleazy Sgt . Ward , or Dr. Mustache Love .. So why would you invest any time or energy in this movie ? Where there is no empathy with the characters , there is no reason to bother caring about it . Not to mention the horrible cinematography , which made it look like they 'd filmed the movie through urine , and the five cent bat special effects , many of which appeared to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of bats flying . Not the worst film I 've ever seen on MST3K , but down there in the bottom ranks , definitely .  
0	  A very tired looking Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non-heroes plan to sell to " the Iranians . " Low-rent video nonsense by the producers of " Silk Stalkings " offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged " drama " .. a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects , although the final twists and allegiance shifts could 've been a nifty end to a better movie . Burt still has presence , although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half-baked " one-liners " .  
0	  This superior inferiority to the original dumb " Blind Dead " movie is another trash bin waste . So many people have hyped up these films that I can't believe what they say about it . Since I was a kid I have heard about how scary and great these films are and I saw them all and was throughly disappointed , was everyone on drugs , from the 1970 's or do they just not know how boring this crude is ?  
0	  It 's sad when you can see what a movie was attempting to do , and it is quite obvious that it fell far far short of the mark . Film students should take this as a lesson and a warning . Would be graduate has an idea . He wants total control . So he writes , directs , produces , his cinematic masterpiece all by himself . Usually , his concept is far beyond his budget . Usually he writes an overblown script full of every tag line he can come up with . Usually , he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes . Usually , he ends up with a movie that is feeble in it 's attempt to create miracles on a tiny budget . Usually , he ends up with a series of encounters ( we cannot do justice by calling them scenes ) that feel like they were written by a 12 year old . And usually he ends up with badly acted scenes that fail to grab the viewer . When you look at Judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it 's just the usual fare .  
0	  If you 're watching this movie , you 're either a Fred Olen Ray fan , you found it on the $ 4.99 shelf at Suncoast and thought " what do I have to lose ? " , or you spun around the video store with your eyes closed and rented the first movie your finger touched . This movie is hysterically bad . It 's got everything a terrible movie needs : a screenplay featuring jaw-dropping dialogue and baffling detours in the plot , wacky science involving psychics and other dimensions , continuity that seems to travel through wormholes in time and space , actors that are not only wooden , but seems to border on befuddled , gratuitous nudity ( not all of it is what you necessarily would ask for ) , and of course , a 5 ' monster played by what I assume is Fred Olen Ray 's kid . Underneath it all , however , there is something resembling heart - as if Mickey & Judy decided to get together all the kids in the neighborhood and make a monster movie ( hey ! my dad can direct it ! yeah ! We can use red paint from my johnny 's dad 's hardware store , and I know this ex-stripper who can act in it ! ) . Watch for the blooper reel over the credits - you get to find out why the final cut of the movie was so crappy . Incidentally , Biohazard II .. the Alien Force is also worth a look , but doesn't have the same enjoyably crappy veneer this one does .  
0	  Let me begin by saying I am a big fantasy fan . However , this film is not for me . Many far-fetched arguments are trying to support this film 's claim that dragons possibly ever existed . The film mentions connections in different stories from different countries , but fails to investigate them more thoroughly , which could have given the film some credibility . The film uses ( nice ! ) CGI to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon 's life . This is combined with popular TV show CSI style flash-forwards to make it look like something scientific , which it is definitely not . In many cases the arguments / clues are far-fetched . In some cases , clues used to show dragons possibly existed , or flew , or spit fire are simply invalid . To see this just makes me get cramp in my toes . Even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it , but this one just doesn't have it . Bottom line : it 's a pretentious fantasy-CSI documentary , not worth watching .  
1	  After CITIZEN KANE in 1941 , Hollywood executives turned their cob-webbed backs on the great Orson Welles . With the exception of KANE , Welles lost all creative control on MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS , JOURNEY INTO FEAR , and many other films to come . Welles was an innovative and creative genius , the most unconventional of filmmakers when Hollywood was in need of a few more . THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is yet another example of the misunderstood view of Welles ' films at the time , a movie that seems a bit choppy and non-fluent . It has a conventional 1940 's premise told in a most unconventional way , and I am sure some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor . It is now legend that Columbia mogul Harry Cohn stood up during its initial screening and asked what it was about . In hindsight , many old grumps that ran the studios back then had not one clue as to the cinematic techniques and master story-telling of Orson Welles and THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is only nearly great because of their intrusion . Beside being arguably the greatest director of all-time , Welles was also quite a performer as an actor . At 25 , we all know what he did as " Charles Foster Kane " , perhaps the most famous character in film history . Here , he inhabits a rare character of dim wit and not much intelligence , something unfamiliar to those familiar with Welles other great work . Instead of a slick , wise tongue , he speaks with a rough , Irish twang . Rita Hayworth ( his unhappily married wife at the time ) plays an unhappily married wife of a lawyer who puts Welles in a spell and is able to draw him into a job that will take him to the limits of deception and disillusionment . He is a large lug who may have even murdered a man , but the real mystery lies in the relationship between Hayworth ( with stunning blonde hair ) and crippled hubby Everett Sloane ( Mr. Bernstein from CITIZEN KANE ) . A creepy partner of Sloane 's is along for the sail around the country to set off a number of peculiar events that has Welles ' " Michael O'Hara " head spinning . Welles narrates the picture as O'Hara , but things are still unclear throughout . See for yourself and realize that it takes at least 2 viewings to fully know exactly what 's up . An uncharacteristically strange courtroom sequence centers around " O'Hara " , with Sloane defending him . It is an oddly comedic scene with some quirky courtroom methods , including Sloane cross-examining himself . I didn't really laugh here because the film stalls at this point after a first portion that never gets to take off anyway . Up to this point , the cinematography is great , some scenes are shot with craft and skill ( aquarium love scene ) , but there is no distinct line drawing the elements and us , the audience , in . Reportedly , the court scene was re-shot against Welles ' requests ( 10 closeups of Hayworth were ordered ) and a makeshift song sung by the starlet was thrown in at Cohn 's insistence . A gaudy score infuriated Welles , who once again , was left out of the editing process . Thank Welles himself for saving the film entirely with a tour-de-force ending that will always be treasured . The so-called " Hall of Mirrors " scene brings buffs back time and time again , rightfully so . It must be seen to be believed and it does a good job of wrapping up some confusing ideas presented . The crash of the mirrors represents " O'Hara 's " disillusionment and the " crazy house " itself is a masterpiece of art and set decoration . It seems more like a state of mind than an actual place and is indeed " crazy " , twisted and turned like a Dali painting . This is a great ending to a flawed picture that if left alone would probably have made the AFI 's Top 100 . Then again , 3 or 4 more of Orson Welles films may have made all collective " best of " lists if he had been left alone to create his own magic . NOTE : Look for the Mercury Players that are so prominent in Welles pictures . They pop up all over . RATING : 8 of 10  
0	  I get the feeling that the producers of this mess were out to make the most painful , ridiculous Western ever made . " PAINFUL " is the best word I can think of to describe it . On the plus side you have nice color photography and beautiful and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming . My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon ( who played the cripple ) , who acted well enough in an annoying role , written so atrociously that no actor could give an enjoyable performance . The production values were quite good , which only served to highlight the terrible story and screenplay . Things I hated : Stewart Granger looked so little like a western figure , what with his British accent , neat tailored outfit , and silly immaculate always-white kerchief tied around his neck . It got tiresome the way the townspeople and his son were constantly haranguing and insulting Granger , and he never spoke up or replied back . I know we are supposed to suspend disbelief and appreciate Westerns as symbolic morality plays , but this one broke the spell with it laughably unrealistic and predictable scenes , the worst being at the end where Granger miraculously , speedily and single-handedly plants dynamite around a canyon pass that the bad guy 's cattle will pass through , and then Granger plants himself in the perfect spot so he can shoot the dynamite from a very far distance to create rock slides to bury and spook the cattle and bad guys , seemingly destroying them all , save the two main bad guys . Next worst is everything about the plot , which is loaded with soap opera scenes . Nothing in the movie seemed believable : I couldn't believe what all the conflict was about . The bad guy was driving his herd through to market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the way ; I don't see why something couldn't have been worked out . You need a land ownership dispute for that ? Don't bother to see it .  
1	  After seeing the " Batman Dead End " short , I didn't know what to really expect from World 's Finest . Of Course , Superman AND Batman . All my World 's Finest comic books have them as the team-up . After seeing this 3-and-a-half minute trailer , it made me wish someone would make a serialized fan film for World 's Finest , if not an actual full-length film . Sure , some of the Superman stuff was cheesy , but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers , giving you only certain aspects of the entire product . This looks like it needs a complete product . Other than director Sandy Collera 's relative playing an achingly poor Perry White , most of the actors were unknown . If an actual movie was made , actors would be cast to fit the bill for the film , though I believe Nina Kaczorowski would make a good Lois Lane , especially if given closer to the character dialogue . Good to see Clark Bartram wearing the Batman costume from Dead End , but it should be updated a bit more and not be like the 40s Batman with the 80s-90s leather cape and cowl . His demeanor is Batman-like , but I still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just allowing his eyes to show through the mask . I believe the goal was to get it as close to the comic character than the movie persona . Michael O'Hearn cannot play Superman , period . He stands around with a goofy look on his face that simply says , " slap me . " And line delivery seems to be a problem with him . Overall , though , I would love to see a complete story and film based on this ingenious piece of work . There was a rumor about a World 's Finest movie being made , and with the correct additions to the script , this could be it . Hope more like this are made .  
1	  The inspiring story of Carl Brashear ( Cuba Gooding , Jr. ) , a black man who grew up in poverty in Kentucky and then joined the US Navy , aspiring to be the first black Master Diver in Navy history . We are shown the series of struggles from boyhood on that Brashear has to overcome to make his dream come true ( and then to keep it alive . ) Not the least of the challenges was Master Diver Bill Sunday ( Robert DeNiro ) , the head trainer at the diving school the Navy sends Brashear to , who is not especially sympathetic to Brashear 's goals , but who ultimately becomes an unlikely friend and supporter . This is a good movie ; fast paced and with a lot of action , although not an " action " pic in the normal sense of the word . There 's a very human story here as well , and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it ; there 's also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960 's between older and younger naval officers ( the " old navy " vs the " new navy . " ) The performances are quite good - particularly Goodings ' . I thought DeNiro was perhaps a bit over the top in his portrayal of Sunday ( although , who knows , Sunday might well have been this extreme kind of loose cannon ) and the portrayal of Sunday 's wife Gwen ( by Charlize Theron ) also made me question whether these parts were " jazzed up " to provide entertainment value . A good movie , though . I never once wondered if it was worth tuning into . 7/10  
1	  What I loved about the on-screen adaptation of The Stone Angel is that it stayed so true to the novel ! Great film ! As an avid reader , I find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation . You can tell the Stone Angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film . Ellen Burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of Hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar . However , I think the Canadian actress ( Christine Horne ) chosen to play Hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise . I haven't seen any of Horne 's previous work but I will definitely seek it out after seeing her Stone Angel performance . I heard the Canadian theatrical release of The Stone Angel is going to happen in Spring or Summer 2008 . I can't wait to see it on the big screen again !  
0	  Personally I think this show looks pretty cheaply made . Some of the actors are terrible . They over do it & seem fake . I can always tell how it 's going to end within the first 10 minutes or less of watching because they make it so transparently clear . It 's not very well written either . I love to watch it to laugh at it . You know the saying " It 's so bad that it 's good ? " Well , that saying applies to this show . I also like to watch just to see if I 'm right when I guess how it 's all going to end . So far I 've been right every time . It 's like a little game that I play . It 's nice when you are bored & you feel like laughing at something .  
1	  This movie had lots of great actors and actresses in it and it addressed some very noble issues . It 's full of emotion and the direction is done well . The storyline progresses very quickly , but I guess that 's better than having to watch a 3 hour movie . This is an easy movie to watch again and again and enjoy .  
0	  Eddie Murphy 's " Delirious " is completely and totally rude , crude , crass and lude . This is indeed the only way to describe this appalling , trashy piece of stand-up . Eddie Murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over . He does manage to be funny occasionally , but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokes . Forget it ! Unless you happen to enjoy Eddie 's foul style . I don't think I will bother with " Eddie Murphy Raw " . I much prefer Eddie in the confines of a movie script . Saturday , January 17 , 1998 - Video  
1	  Woody Allen 's second movie set in London . Tha Tarot Card murderer is killing prostitutes in London . Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky ( Scarlett Johansson ) gets a tip that he may be Lord Peter Lyman ( Hugh Jackman ) . She starts to romance him but quickly falls in love . She 's helped by stage magician Sid Waterman ( Woody Allen ) who doesn't like what he sees . I like this better than the over rated " Match Point " from last year . It was shorter and moved much more quickly . The plot is old but I was entertained and it kept me guessing till the very end . It 's not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines ( all from Allen of course ) . It 's not one of Allen 's best but it 's far better than his worst . The acting is , for the most part , very good . Allen is bad but he 's played this character a million times before and it 's gotten tiresome . But Johansson and Jackman are just great-they look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances . Also Allen ( surprisingly ) works on their sex appeal-there is a sequence where they 're both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies . The only real debit is that Allen still seems unsure on how to shot London . He 's not as off as he was on " Match Point " though-maybe he 'll just get better as he goes along . Worth seeing . I give it an 8 .  
0	  Although in many ways I agree with the other reviewers comments . I find that the plot and idea are very good . Many of the supporting actors were very good . The fatal problem with this film is Ellen Pompeo . I am sure , I have never seen a less talented " actor " How this person has ever been in a film or on television , I cannot imagine . In my opinion she would be better as a greater at a Wal-Mart . To see a person with this low level of talent involved in paying roles , does beg the question .. " Who does she know " ? I would very much like to see this film re-made with some talent . I do not fault the writer for the failure of this film to be worth the time to view it .  
1	  A kid with ideals who tries to change things around him . A boy who is forced to become a man , because of the system . A system who hides the truth , and who is violating the rights of existence . A boy who , inspired by Martin Luther King , stands up , and tells the truth . A family who is falling apart , and fighting against it . A movie you can't hide from . You see things , and you hear things , and you feel things , that you till the day you die will hope have never happened for real . Violence , frustration , abuse of power , parents who can't do anything , and a boy with , I am sorry , balls , a boy who will not accept things , who will not let anything happen to him , a kid with power , and a kid who acts like a pro , like he has never done anything else , he caries this movie to the end , and anyone who wants to see how abuse found place back in the 60'ies .  
0	  I really hate this retarded show , it SUCKS ! big time , and personally I think it is insulting to fairy kind ( if you believe in fairies that is ) ; I mean the people who had come up with such crap ' ought to have their heads examine huh ? and also there is a LOT of craziness ( the evil school teacher , which I think is getting really old ) and also stupidity ( the boy 's parents and fairy godfather ) in this show - two of the things that I dispised and loathe in the WHOLE world ( especially stupidity ) . Overall , I say that this show is so f * ' annoying and should not be seen by prying eyes at ALL ( it would make'em bleed to death ) !  
1	  I can remember this movie from when i was a small child , i loved it then and I still do now . I managed to get it on DVD for my 18th Birthday and was over joyed because I had found it so difficult to find it previously and it had only be rented when i was younger . My favourite character is Charlie because he learns to be a good dog . The movie is filled with fun songs and music . The animation is brilliant and the character voices are perfect . This movie has always been a tearjerker for me but i think that if i hadn't seen the movie when i was small then i would not find it as brilliant and fascinating as I do although I still believe that I would still like it because I am Really into animated movies .  
0	  Having just recently re-viewed " Lipstick " for the first time in a few decades , I backed it with " Descent " even though I have heard more negative comments than good from other film friends with tastes as varied as mine . It 's interesting to contrast how the unique niche of the Rape Revenge movie has evolved in the past 32 years , from the full-on gore of " I Spit On Your Grave , " to the tawdry sensationalism of " Lipstick , " to the tasteful handling of the issue in " The Accused . " But " Descent , " though making some important points , never really offers us anything truly new in terms of revelatory meaning . No , " Descent " is so poorly made in terms of picture and sound quality that it detracts from any significant message it could hope to make - a message that , when examined closely , isn't that groundbreaking . I pretty much knew the plot going in . What I wanted to see * was * the " descent " or degeneration of Dawson 's character . Being a big fan of Rosario 's , I was anxious to see the layers being stripped away and her psyche being slowly twisted .. you know , the kind of portrayal DeNiro brings to " Taxi Driver . " Unfortunately , the script and the director / writer 's choices don't provide any sort of believable transition . The biggest point of failure is the second act . It became obvious what the filmmaker 's intentions were for this segment of club-hopping , drug use , and obsession with big black stallion Adrian ( every white boy 's nightmare , natch ) from a Q & A on the DVD , but this excursion into Dawson 's character is never believably rendered . We don't know exactly what the hell she 's doing half the time , what she 's after , or why she 's doing it . The poor quality of the audio / video again don't help , but the sequence is just too damn long and pointless . It destroys any momentum and investment in the lead character set up during the otherwise exceptionally well-done first act . By the time we get to the finale , our interest has already waned . One point of success that Dawson does point out in the Q & A is that by the end " revenge " scene we are pumped for retribution , then realize just how drawn-out and ugly the reality is . While that 's certainly valid , it doesn't make the scene any more intriguing . If you have the DVD , check out the deleted " classroom " scene . This is an excellent 8 minute plus outtake that crackles with energy and provocation ( though all verbal ) and really DOES show Dawson 's slow crack-up materializing as she delightfully vivisects poor Francie Swift 's prissy , condescending dorm counselor . If more expository scenes like this had been added and more of the middle third cut down , we might have an interesting psychological study of the impact of senseless acts of violence . As the film stands in the final cut , though , all we get is what we 've seen before , only in a more graphic rendering . So what ?  
0	  What " Noise " fails to do is get us to understand its character . Tim Robbins plays an obsessive New Yorker who can't deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer , particularly car alarms . It 's an odd idea for a film , which has about as much creative credibility as " Death Wish . " It is clever at points ; particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through Hagel , " I 'm too stupid to be understanding this . " He reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion , we read it and don't get it either . Just then a car alarm goes off . Throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises . Though , all in all it does little to help us understand our hero , who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper-into his persona . The film-making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems , shoddy editing , and visible boom mikes . No , " Noise " isn't all-bad . William Hurt is at least colorful . At least the ending doesn't fall flat . Overall it drives home a logistical point , one you haven't probably thought of . At least I hadn't . Though all in all , ninety minutes long , it couldn't have ended sooner . The story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started . This is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival , but probably won't get picked up for distribution . Check it out on DVD if you 're really partial to someone involved in the project . Otherwise skip it .  
1	  In the film " Brokedown Palace , " directed by Jonathan Kaplan , two best friends , Alice ( Claire Danes ) and Darlene ( Kate Beckinsale ) decide to celebrate high school graduation by taking a trip to Hawaii , but hear that Bangkok , Thailand , is much more fun . They switched plans and decided to go to Thailand without telling their parents the change of plans . While they were in Thailand , Alice and Darlene met a really handsome guy named Nick Parks ( Daniel Lapaine ) . He tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to Hong Kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in Hong Kong . They accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs . They were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison . I think Kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever . Also , a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face . Those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever . Things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made . Sometimes life is not fair , that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have made . This movie has a great setting ; it was filmed mostly in Bangkok Thailand . This film also has great music ; a few of my favorite songs are ' Silence ' by Delerium , ' Damaged ' by Plumb , ' Deliver me ' by Sarah Bightman and ' Party 's just begun ' by Nelly Furtado . I went out and bought the soundtrack after watching this film . These girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly , a mistake that anyone could make , therefore this film is good for any audience . It makes no difference young or old - we all are human and subject to mistakes . Even though , I did not like the way this film ended leaving me in question of - who really smuggled the drugs ? - I would definitely give this film two thumbs up .  
1	  Women have never looked so attractive and pathetic as in Salazar 's film Piedras . Although editor 's cut here and there might help the film , it is exciting and enjoyable with an intense mark from Pedro Almodovar 's latest films . 5 different women are coping with their male partners and families . Beginning with several different stories bound to meet as the plot goes on , Salazar portraits his women characters in the same neurotic and border-line behaviour familiar to Almodovar . A kleptomaniac high society lady with a fattish to smaller shoes , a burlesque house madam taking care of her disabled daughter , a drug addict dancer obsessed with her former boyfriend and a taxi-driver taking care of her late husband 's disturbed kids , all roaming the streets of Madrid in well designed scenes . Using some of Almodovar 's familiar actresses , the director succeeds in it 's first film to give depth to all the characters sharing the film , and to create genuine sympathy with each of them . The women controls the plot line , and the men are bound to be left with each other , eventually .. Surprisingly good for a first film , and worth the time in any standard . It is noticeable that Salazar hesitated in some needed guidelines to the actresses , but an impressible act is shown anyway on the screen , especially by Monica Cervera , which played in his former short film . A must to all Almodovar 's fans , and enjoyable to all .  
1	  A wonderful film version of the best-selling book and smash Broadway play about the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany , two African-American sisters who both lived over the age of 100 and told their story of witnessing a century of American history . Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll give very good performances as Bessie and Sadie , respectively . Amy Madigan also is good as Amy Hill Hearth , the white New York Times reporter whose article about the sisters launched the book , etc . Many of the flashback scenes and even many of the present-day ones are very powerful , if not quite as inspirational as in the book . That is the only real drawback , combined with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not presented clearly , such as the inter-racial background of the sisters ' mother and why their father was so stern . But other than that , a very well-done , excellently performed , powerful movie .  
1	  Well when watching this film late one night I was simple amazed by it 's greatness . Fantastic script , great acting , costumes and special effects , and the plot twists , wow ! In fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself . Great , I would recommend this film to anyone , especially if I don ; t like them much . Terrific  
0	  This warning against anti-semitism is well-meant and may have had its purpose at the time , but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a film . The director has no idea about mise-en-scene ; the cast varies from bad till even worse . The great Austrian comic Hans Moser is wasted . In his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy , that is designed as a set from Das Kabinett des Dr. Caligari ; one wonders whether the makers had all their mental capabilities . The restored copy I saw ( Dutch Filmmuseum ) gives the impression that some scenes were not put into the right place , but may be the original editing was bad as well .  
1	  This is definitely one of Jet 's best efforts . Few actors are able to play the stoic as Jet Li can . The action is rapid-fire , and special-effects boosted for intensity purposes . As a result , it may take Americans a little off-guard . A little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a Jet Li film . I feel that it is an excellent introduction to Jet 's work and look forward to further masterpieces ( especially Fist of Legend ) making it into the US market . A nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts .  
1	  Being from a small town in Illinois myself , I can instantly relate to this movie . Considering the era it was made in , the townsfolk look uncomfortably like a lot of people I grew up with . Yes the plot is so-so . And yes , the Acting is not going to get nominated for an Oscar anytime soon . But that isn't the point . The point is to suspend reality and just have FUN . And this movie has Fun aplenty . From the greedy , uncaring banker to the well meaning , but dimwitted deputy , this movie was made to poke fun at the SciFi genre and small town living at it 's best . Who can't smile at the sight of the Enforcer Drone or the Vern Droid ? and I LOVED the FarmZoid . Wish I had one when I was growing up . Overall , considering the technology they had available at the time , this is a pleasant romp into one 's childhood , when you could sit back on a Saturday afternoon , Popcorn in hand , and laugh at the foibles of small town living . This is a movie I would watch again and again , if for no other reason than to poke fun at myself and my small town ways .  
1	  Everything was better in past days . Even children 's television . And Fraggle Rock proves my point quite easily . At the time of writing this comment I am fourteen years old but even in my teen years I can't resist the charm of Fraggle Rock . For those of you that have indeed been living under a rock ( haha ! ) , Fraggle Rock is about a horde of playful and goofy creatures called Fraggles who live-amazingly-in a rock . But they 're not the only creatures . The rock is inhabited with many other species like the hardworking Doozers and countless living plants . Outside the rock on one side live inventor-scientist Doc and his dog Sprocket ( who later befriends Gobo Fraggle ) , on the other side a family of Gorgs-supposed rulers of the Universe . The five main Fraggles Gobo ( fearless leader ) , Mokey ( arty and peaceful ) , Wembley ( indecisive and a friend to Gobo ) , Boober ( a pessimistic domestic god ) and Red ( loves anything to do with sport and general feistyness ) get caught up in some strange situations each episode while at the same time sing and dance their cares away . Fraggle Rock is definitely a family show-the plots may have intricate details that infants may not follow well , but the song-and-dance routines will hold their attention . The characters are strong and likable , their conflicts believable and their adventures thrilling . The Gorgs are frightening , Doc and Sprocket enlightening , Uncle Travelling Matt hilarious ( the postcard segments are very 80s ! ) and the final episode , Change of Address , genuinely touching . Let 's go down to Fraggle Rock again !  
0	  It doesn't even merit a review , other than as a warning to potential viewers . It 's a somewhat generic ghost story about an actress haunting a studio during the filming of a WWII period drama . There 's no fear involved , no suspense whatsoever , nor any surprises . One shocking moment that looks a bit too silly to be shocking . The visual style is very flat and dull , although there is some really nice editing once in a while . The story never comes together , and the films is really just a total bust . 4/10 .  
1	  This incredibly formulaic flick from the " Walker , Texas Ranger " squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie . In addition , one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get-go . However , it 's a fun little movie that gets the job done : it entertains . That 's all it was meant to do and it does so . The stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn't half bad . The acting is also decent , which isn't much of a surprise , because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal . If you 're a fan of the genre ( and of " Walker , Texas Ranger " ) , you will definitely love this . If not , then don't waste your time . 8/10  
0	  This is an attempt , by both author Edgar Rice Burroughs and filmmakers , at an Arabian " Tarzan of the Apes " . But , this desert-set film shows none of the majesty present in Burroughs ' more successful jungle adventure . The focus is on the love between handsome English noble Jon Hall ( as " El ' Lion " Chatham ) and exotic Arab beauty Kathleen Burke ( as " Princess " Eulilah ) , with revenge happening to coincide with their urge to merge . The opening states that , although guilty of conduct unbecoming , the lad 's mother is living - but , she never re-enters the picture . Unfortunately , " The Lion Man " has deteriorated , and is looks like it 's missing footage . * The Lion Man ( 1936 ) John P. McCarthy ~ Jon Hall , Kathleen Burke , Ted Adams  
1	  This film , recently voted as an audience favorite at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival , is inspiring and moving . A famous conductor , forced to retire by illness , returns to the small village of his birth to become the leader of the church choir , and finally find fulfillment in his music . Drawing on Sweedish traits of keeping things within oneself and of the insular character of a small Swedish village , this film develops each of its characters well . superbly directed , acted and sung , it brought tears to many eyes , and smiles to all . Hopefully it will find distribution in the United States . If you can , see it !  
1	  An original uncensored print of this amazing film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress , and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005 . According to current reviews that I 've found online , the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact ; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release , in order to pass the New York state censors . I have also read that a DVD is " expected in 2006 " and one can only hope ! If we 're really luckily , it will include comparisons between the 2 versions . Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc , which I have seen . Stanwyck rules !

0	  Jungle Fever is too highly stylized , stereotyped , and comes across as essentially dishonest . Wesley Snipes was wrong for the lead and there was no chemistry between him and Annabella Sciorra . Even though there 's plenty of talent in this movie , it 's mostly wasted because the parts are reduced to little more than decorative cameos . Also , instead of simply showing racism for the ugly and stupid thing it is , Spike Lee chooses to wave it around like a flag in a most whining and irritating manner . I made it through most of the film but I couldn't quite finish it , and that , for me , rarely happens .  
0	  This ranks way up there on my top list of worst movies I 've seen so far on Starz on Demand . They seem to pick up every straight to DVD crap-fest they can find and put it on here . Why ? Who knows ! Apparently anyone with a digital camera and a shoestring budget can come up with a horror movie and get it put on TV . To be honest , this looked terrible from the moment I saw the trailer-but I did give it a real chance . I always try to have an open mind about low-budget movies . Some of the best movies I 've ever seen were films that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required that low budget to be great . This is not one of those movies . You know the plot by now , I 'm sure , if you 're reading this . Either you heard about it on Starz on Demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom . It 's about a pathetic and whiny girl we get to know for all of 3 minutes in an incredibly bad " heavy metal " music video . Whoever put it together must have thought it looked really interesting , but it really , really doesn't . Anyway , she kills herself . Then she possesses someone . Then some killing starts . It 's really unmemorable and as completely average and boring as possible . When the first gunshot goes off in her apartment it quite seriously sounds like a piece of popcorn popping . Was that the best sound effect they could come up with ? I could find a better sound effect to use for free , ( with no copyright , ) on the internet .. right . now . Don't let the other reviews claiming this is a 10 star movie fool you . They are obviously either distributors of the film or maybe even the director trying to con you into thinking this piece of junk is worth buying . Laughable .  
0	  The majority of Stephen King 's short stories are little gems , with original ideas that don't take a long time to develop ; basically lean and mean-he sets them up quickly in a scarce number of pages , you read ' em , and you 're finished before you know you 've begun . They 're like the equivalent of a carton of McDonald 's fries-they taste Really good and you know there 's not much nutritional value in them ( re : from a literary standpoint , they don't say much about the universal human condition ) , but you 're still gonna scarf ' em down , just don't be a pig and go for the extra-super-sized portion and fill up on too much grease ( " too much grease " is a metaphor for the prose in King 's novels when find yourself reading one of them and saying come on-enough with the pop-cultural observations or clever Yankee asides-get on with the story already ! ) He has compiled four books of short story collections . I 've read them all-from NightShift to the latest , Everything 's Eventual , and they all display an efficiency of getting to the point which is sometimes sorely lacking in his tome-sized novels . But his short stories never overstay their welcome .. which brings us to the TV adaptations of Nightmares And Dreamscapes .. How in the hell did they ( the series ' producers ) get a green-light to turn stories that usually averaged 15 pages into 50 minute episodes ? I 'll tell you how-two words - " Stephen King . " Stories with his name on them probably didn't come cheap , and one hour shows enable more advertising than half hour ones , so .. what should have been an anthology of mostly 23 or 24 minute episodes is turned into double that length , and double the commercial time .. Ka-Ching ! I 'm not going to waste time synopsizing the plots of these stories-this review supposes you have already read the stories and / or seen the show ; what follows is merely my gut reactions to what TNT presented .. Of the four installments so far , here 's my ten cent assessment ( from first to worst ) : Battleground - Not a classic by any means , but hey , how could anyone argue with keeping William Hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without a single line of dialog ? And the tongue-in-cheek reference and destruction of the killer Zuni doll from Trilogy Of Terror proved to me the producers ( and the writer of the teleplay , who is Richard Matheson 's son-the writer of TOT ) knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly , yet at the same time , fun . It took longer to get to Hurt 's apartment than it should have , but I think it fulfilled it 's objective . 8/10 Umney 's Last Case - Liked this one primarily because of William H. Macy 's performance . I think the writer / Umney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eye / Umney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story , and anyone familiar with the King short story ( probably half , if not more of the audience ) knew the Chandleresque set-up was due to get interrupted by the writer 's reality , so let 's get on with it already , and cut-out the cute and clever hard-boiled repartee ' Private Dick banter already . Once the writer / Umney 's family tragedy began to reveal though , I thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer ( me , at least ) , feel sympathy for the real-life Macy 's attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creation 's exciting life . 6/10 The End Of The Whole Mess - Uh , this title is how I felt about this episode when it was over . After twenty minutes , I was ready to scream at the TV-OK , we get it already , the younger brother is a Mega Mensa Genius Prodigy Extraordinaire ! We know from Ron Livingston talking to the camera ( " time is running out for me " - not fast enough , I thought ) that the young whiz kid is going to discover something really bad for humanity-we know this because he 's already built an airplane but almost died because he couldn't steer it out of the path of a tree ; and , he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry ( to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more parental supervision ) . So much time was wasted on establishing the uber-genius of Henry Thomas , when we finally get to the resolution of his discovery-the end of the world through unintended idiocy-how much do we get to see of the world " ending ? " -a cheap video shot of a reporter starting to forget what she 's reporting on , and brief radio broadcasts announcing the day of judgement is at hand . Oh , and the brother 's parents drooling and singing old songs . My point is , if your story is really about the " end of the whole mess ( world ) " , I wanna see the " mess " as it goes up in flames and crashes and burns . Talk about ending with a whimper , indeed . 2/10 Crouch End - This episode just ticked me off totally . I could have lived with the taking-forever exposition of the happy couple arriving at their hotel , playing slap-and-tickle , having lunch , and getting a taxi ( that was half the episode right there ) , if once they finally crossed-over into Crouch End the episode delivered the chills , but it failed miserabley . Not only wasn't it scary , it was practically laughable . Ooh , look-a kitty .. wait , it turns .. oh my god ! Look at it 's scary eye ! Uh-huh . They could have gone a long way towards filming the Crouch End sequence at night instead of in daylight , too . Things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows . But I guess the budget wasn't high enough to shoot at night on the fake London sets they slapped together for this one . On the page , this is a very scary story about tourists wandering into places they shouldn't and the terrible things that might lurk just around a corner there . The only terror in this adaptation was the directing and acting-those were truly horrifying . 1/10 Overall Series Average ( so far ) : 4/10  
1	  Steve Carell once again stars in a light romantic movie about choices , family and pressure . By judging on the plot and cover art of the movie I was expecting a flat-out comedy , lots of laughs and unrealistic elements , but I guess I was wrong . Sure the movie had some comedy , but it felt much more of a light Drama to me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance . The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found . But , the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable . Through-out , the cinematography was great , the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important . Though , it came down to old , flat and predictable ending . I 'd reckon if different choices were made at the end of the movie ( perhaps for the bad , even ) this movie would get better publicity . Still a fun movie .  
0	  Warner Bros . made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced , economical and very entertaining . I really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life . This is one of Warner 's few hard-edged melodramas that simply doesn't work . Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the 20-year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences . Robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don't cut the mustard . H.B. Warner , Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good , but the bad acting of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie . Starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie . In addition , the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre-code Hollywood . LeRoy 's direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations . Sol Polito 's camera work is strong . Somehow , this piece of dreck got an Oscar nomination for Best Picture ( in a year that gave us " M , " " Dracula " and " Frankenstein " ) .  
0	  Autobiography of founder of zoo in NYC starts out by being very cute and would be great family movie if it stayed there . however we get more and more involved with reality as gorilla grows up to be a wild thing not easily amenable to his " mother 's " wishes - this might scare younger children , esp . scenes where Buddy tries to injure Gertrude . rather quick resolution at the end . below average .  
1	  Such a masterpiece as the first of these two Snowy River films was , the sequel to The Man From Snowy River is everything that a follow-up should be . It does not tread on the toes of its predecessor , preferring to leave the legend that was the first film live on in some unique immortality . The Man From Snowy River II is based upon the return of Jim Craig to the Snowy River country after a three year absence . The film subtly tells a tale of change in the nineteenth century , of Australian history , legend and horses . The storyline demonstrates a touch of Hollywood in lighter shades , an aspect that was absolutely absent in the first film , yet this blends uniquely with the a distinct sense of Australian patriotism . The plot is far more vibrant than the first film , and much more showy , with particular aspects of the previous incorporated into the film , yet The Man From Snowy River II possesses every essential characteristic of the first film ; sensationally beautiful cinematography , a stunning focus of the Australian high country , the second most impressive footage of horses ever filmed , and a fantastic and deeply moving soundtrack by Bruce Rowland which equals the first in every way . Geoff Burrowes has done a superb job with this film , and it is highly worthy of recognition , especially with regard to the quality of the Australian Film Industry . The lead cast , from Tom Burlinson to Sigrid Thornton , and a well-replaced Brian Dennehy , carry off their parts with as much passion and distinction as the first film . As far as sequels can go , The Man From Snowy River II is a masterpiece ; a deeply moving and inspirational experience yet again .  
0	  All the ingredients of low-brow b-movie cult cinema . Topless ( and bottomless ) girls , kung-fu kicking chefs , slave traders , evil Germans with mustaches , Cameron Mitchell and sword-wielding zombies . And , of course the breasts of Camille Keaton , who 's best known display occurs in the feminist exploitation classic I Spit on Your Grave . We also must mention the hooters of jewel Shepard , who play a hooker in the recent film The Cooler . Lots of blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among topless dancers in a bar , in a whorehouse , and on a boat load of martial artists heading to some zombie island where bad martial artists go to die or something like that . Tops and bottoms come off easily and frequently as travelers are well lubricated thanks to the boat owner . Then disaster strikes as their boat is destroyed and they land on the zombie island where mas monks sacrifice young girls to the dead martial artists to bring them back to life . Just when you thought it had everything , there are piranhas in the water . Yum Yum A big fat German for dinner . Just the thing for your next zombie fest .  
0	  One of the worst films I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through , Killer Tongue is a horrible melange of the worst elements of The Rocky Horror Picture Show , Brain Damage , and Pulp Fiction . Designed primarily to offend , apparently , but so inane that only the most hidebound conservatives would be taken in by it .  
0	  Thanks to this film , I now can answer the question , " What is the worst movie you have ever seen ? " I can't even think of a close second , and I 've seen some really bad movies . Absolutely nothing works in this film . Name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails . Honestly , I 've seen better on YouTube . Here 's some typical dialogue : " Steve ? " " Steve ? " " Steve , is that you ? " " Steve , I 'm not kidding " " Steve , this isn't funny ! " " Steve , are you there ? " " Steve ? " " Steve ? " " Steve ? " " ARggh ! Ahh ! Noo ! "  
1	  Not to be confused with the Resse Witherspoon high school film of the same name , this is a stylised look at Hong Kong 's triad gangs . Called election because a new leader or ' chairman ' is elected by ancient traditions every two years . Two candidates are up for the position and through ego , bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least . Expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory . The Asian godfather this is not , but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence . Subtitled volume 1 I think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals . Either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right .  
0	  I 'm not going to waste my time writing an essay and waste your time . I would like to say , however , that all those who are uptight about this movie even being made are being totally ridiculous . Johnnymacbest , you can't play that card , and I mean the nationalism patriotic card , to make people not watch this movie . this is a movie that expresses its free will in this country ( oh yea i played that card ) even though the director is German and deserves a slap on the wrist every time he reaches for a camera , but the world is full of controversy , and its the same thing you 've heard before , like the GTA controversy . It 's a comedy , laugh and be disgusted , not disgusted all together , its dark humor and obviously you don't have the heart to take it , the past is past , yes people remember those who were lost but its time to move on , that was ! 7 ! years ago . You can still watch this movie and have good moral values . Besides I 'm insane , and who needs a soul ?  
1	  This was the best movie I 've ever seen about Bulimia . It hit the exact spot of what Bulimia is really about and how it 's not always about being skinny and dieting . It showed how people with Bulimia tend to think about things such as their outlook on life , friends and themselves . The best line and the part that really shows what the problem with Bulimia is , is when Beth says , " It 's not about you ! " That line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem . It showed that people with Bulimia don't have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else . It has to do with them and them only . It shows that it 's time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves . It showed that Beth needed to call out for attention at that moment and she needed her mom 's attention at that time the most .  
0	  This documentary is at its best when it is simply showing the ayurvedic healers ' offices and treatment preparation . There is no denying the grinding poverty in India and desperation of even their wealthier clients . However , as an argument for ayurvedic medicine in general , this film fails miserably . Although Indian clients mention having seen " aleopathic " doctors , those doctors are not interviewed , and we have to take the vague statements of their patients at face value - " the doctor said there was no cure , " " the doctor said it was cancer " etc . Well , " no cure " doesn't mean " no treatment , " and what type of cancer exactly does the patient have ? The film is at its most feeble when showing ayurvedic practice in America . There it is reduced , apparently , to the stunning suggestion that having a high powered Wall Street job can make your stomach hurt .  
1	  Rich , alcoholic Robert Stack falls in love with secretary Lauren Bacall . He marries her and is so happy he stops drinking . However , Bacall is secretly loved by Stacks ' best friend , Rock Hudson . And Stacks ' nymphomaniac sister , Dorothy Malone , lusts after Rock . Throw in a few complications and the movie goes spinning out of control ( in a good way ) . Very glossy movie in beautiful Technicolor with jaw-dropping fashions and furnishings ( check out Bacall 's hotel room at the beginning ) . Everybody looks perfect and dresses in beautiful , form-fitting clothes . Basically this is a soap opera with grade A production values . The story itself is lots of fun and some of the dialogue at the beginning is hilariously over the top . The acting by Hudson , Stack and Bacall isn't that good , but seeing them so young and glamorous is great .. especially Stack .. when he smiled my knees went weak ! Dorothy Malone , on the other hand , is fantastic-she deservedly won Best Supporting Actress for her role . She 's sexy , violent , vicious and sympathetic .. all convincingly . Fun , glossy trash . Don't miss it !  
1	  As an old white housewife I can still appreciate that Laurence Fishburne is one of our finest actors . anyone who appreciates his work like in Deep Cover might enjoy watching the incredible acting range of this actor . Since I think this is his directorial debut it might prove even more interesting . All of the acting is quite good . If you can't take lower Manhattan junky worlds or the reality of crime life ( not glorified action shoot-em ups ) then this is not a film you would enjoy . It is Mr. Fishburne 's usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships . I would love to see Larry and Anthony Hopkins go at each other some day in a movie .  
1	  This movie has been poorly received and badly reviewed . The book by Rebecca West was written in 1918 , soon after WWI , when shell shock and trauma-induced amnesia were not clichés , as the reviewers call it many books and movies later . It is difficult to go back in time and live , as the characters lived , the realities of the time : the war and the horror of the experience of the first war to use lethal gas , the British class system the wife thought all-important , the hopeless spinster , and the lover from the past still seen with the eyes of love being as young and as beautiful as she was 20 years ago . Alan Bates as the amnesiac soldier who " will die " if he isn't allowed to see Margaret , the girl of his youthful dreams , builds on the devotion his character showed in " Far From the Madding Crowd " . Having seen that performance , it is possible to sense his strong romantic attachment to the girl who didn't live up to the family 's and society 's expectations . Margaret says , " We quarreled , and as you rowed away , you turned your face away from me . " So we know that the breakup was something that he instigated , that it brought him shame , but that he forgot the shame in his memory of his time with Margaret . I haven't seen all his films , but in the ones I 've seen , he imparts a strong masculinity , which shines through even in this role as the disabled soldier . I didn't even recognize Ann-Margaret at first and feel that her performance has been underrated . Not having read the book , I wondered whether the child who died was the result of acting on a borderline incestuous feeling between Jenny and Chris , though Jenny does state that she " is a cousin " . The way Kitty keeps Jenny in the nursery in the hair-drying scene , the fact that Kitty says she always dries her hair in that room seems more a way for Kitty to keep the coals of anger hot than the orientation of the room to the sun , or sentiment about a lost child , and the statement she made that she wished Chris hadn't felt it necessary to preserve the room exactly as it was when the child was alive made her seem uncaring toward the memory of the child . Also , Jenny is shown as living in the house in a subservient role , as high society would have done to a fallen member at the time . Having recently been the recipient of the intense fantasy of a lover ( non-sexualin keeping with the mores of the time ) from 50 years ago , I couldrelate to Margaret 's and her husband 's dilemma . I , too , was cast aside because I wasn't good enough for his family , and upon his rediscovery of me via the internet , I was burdened with helping him deal with his still very horrifying Vietnam experiences and a marriage to a woman above his class whom he didn't believe he loved . My husband , like Margaret 's was very understanding , but the strain was very real . The lover was finally able to reconcile his real-life situation with his fantasy of loving only me . I thought that it was a good decision to show very little of the reliving of the war experience that was happening in Chris 's mind . I thought of " Mrs. Dalloway " with the WWI soldier who acts out very violent memories and commits suicide versus Chris 's joy in his fantasy of Margaret . In contrast , the actiona of the soldier in " Mrs. Dalloway " seems overwrought . Showing that the psychiatrist understood very little of what was happening to Chris underlines what a major problem the whole group faced . Everyone seems to get their life back , but was it the right choice ?  
0	  I wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist ( as this film was touted ) but this one failed me miserably . For me , the plot was a bit confusing to follow and I rapidly lost interest . I feel so sorry for John Cusack , Joan Cusack , Ben Kingsley , Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for getting involved with this movie . I 'll remain a fan of all of them but only time can heal my feeling over this one . The one thing I can say positively about the film is that Hillary played Yonica 's character so well that I didn't even recognize Hillary ; it took me a few scenes to realize that it was her . Luckily I rented it for $ 1 through Red Box ; had I paid to see it in on the big screen , I would be really fuming !  
1	  Different film directors from different countries have contributed to the film medium a lot by their thoughts . As a result , we have experienced different genres when the medium is concerned . Jafar Panahi , unlike J.L. Godard or F. Truffault , believes in simple story telling ; Schematic Narratives is one of the main traits of his directorial job . He has trust upon the automatic as well as critical intelligence of the viewer ; he does not feel any necessity to go for Alienation or such things to reach to the viewers . He is equally effective despite being conventional . Offside ( 2006 ) , is another schematic creation from him , where Gender Subordination of Middle-East Asia gets gradually clear to everybody as the simple but catchy tale of the movie progresses . Now-a-days , when all of us are shouting on the issue of Rights of Women , this movie very calmly creeps into our mind and ultimately becomes a hump for our critical intelligence by conveying the message that the Egality of Human Rights is nothing but an illusive good , an utopia . Paternity will never let the women to be empowered . An important soccer match where the nation is participating , a teenage girl who understands the game well , loves her nation does not have the rights to enter into the stadium to cheer for her country . She is merely permitted to listen to the live commentary . Her alias could not work for her . As a result , she had to undergo several humiliating situations . From the very beginning her worried father ran here and there for her daughter . At the end of the day , celebration came as the nation won the match which the girl could not see as she was detained in the outer side of the stadium during the match time . But the celebration cannot suppress the question of Rights of Women which remain in every corner of the world in different format . Jafar Panahi has most successfully pointed to this issue of Gender Abuse from with in the frame of conventional film making and patriarchy as well . A Global Tragedy has been dealt with ease and some times with humour which , in turn , teases our being constantly .  
1	  If you haven't seen this , you do not know what you are missing . The first time you do , you will litteraly be in pain lying on floor throwing up from laughing so hard , and having probably wet yourself as well . It is THAT funny . There hasn't been a single comedic performance to this date that I have seen that tops this or even comes close . So many classic one liners , stories , and segways .. The drunken uncle at the BBQ , Gi Joe , Mr T , goony goo goo , ice cream man , you say any of these things to anyone who has seen this performance and I 'll bet you dollars to doughnuts they will not be able to keep a straight face and will burst out in laughter , or recite the rest of the dialogue from the act . Pure classic ! Shame you can't get it on DVD .. Rating 10 + out of 10  
0	  Five Across the Eyes starts as five young teenage girls are driving home in time for their curfew , they stop off at a store & accidentally hit another car & decide to just drive off & leave it . Soon after the other car forces them to stop & a crazy woman with a shotgun gets out & shouts at them , makes them take their clothes off & makes them pee on them & then randomly drives off . Shaken & shocked the girls think their ordeal is over but the crazy woman comes back for seconds as she seems intent on killing the terrified girls who are lost & are low on gas .. Produced & directed by Greg Swinson & Ryan Theissen with Swinson writing the thing & Theissen responsible for the cinematography & editing I have to say that Five Across the Eyes is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen if not the worst , I mean I 'm struggling to think of a film I have seen that 's worse . Now let me start off by saying that I am sure a lot of the film-making decision taken here were deliberate to try & provoke atmosphere , tension , realism & suspense but there is not one aspect of Five Across the Eyes that I didn't hate it to be honest it looks like a bad home video that has been put up on YouTube & even then it 's still slightly embarrassing & a frankly worthless waste of 90 odd minutes of my time that I could have been doing something more entertaining & fun like pulling my fingernails out with pliers . The reviews on the web seem quite positive but on the IMDb ( the amount of 1 Star comments is revealing & they can't all be wrong , right ? ) & it 's message board which I think is much more of an indicator of what the average person thinks it 's absolutely trashed by just about everyone & the phrase ' the worst film I have ever seen ' is used a few times & to be fair most of these negative comments mention th same things & I have to agree with them . The story is terrible , alright I suspect it 's meant to be minimalistic but this minimal ? There 's never any reason or explanation for the events that happen & it just feels totally random . It goes on for ages , the amount of plot here would struggle to fill a thirty minute made for telly program let along a full length feature . The dialogue is awful with these annoying girls who don't seem to have a brain cell between them taking about random stuff & screaming a lot . Oh god the screaming , there are seemingly endless scenes of these girls screaming or crying or whining which not only irritates & annoys & prevents any sane viewer feeling any sort of sympathy for them it also makes what they are trying to say almost impossible to hear properly . Then there 's the real killer , the entire film is set & shot within the confines of a mini van , seriously the camera never leaves this car & as you can imagine it gets really boring , add that the low body count of just one person killed on screen & Five Across the Eyes is a film that I hated with a passion . On a technical level again I can see that the film-making style here was a deliberate choice but I have to be honest again & say Five Across the Eyes is the worst looking film I have ever seen . As a fan of film I like my films to look like proper films as it 's a visual medium & I definitely don't want them to look worse than the average YouTube video or my home films shot on a camcorder while I was drunk . It really does look that amateurish & that bad , it 's a complete eyesore & I hated every moment of every second of it . Just think The Blair Witch Project ( 1999 ) only ten times worse looking & sounding & you will be almost there . There are times during Five Across the Eyes when you literally can't tell what 's going on or happening because of the camera-work & the almost pitch black & grainy contrast levels . The violence is tame too with a few splashes of blood & a stabbing at the end . Low budget doesn't even begin to describe Five Across the Eyes , with a supposed budget of about $ 4,000 this is easily one of the lowest budgeted films ever given a wide release . The two vans in the film were owned by members of the production & that 's basically pretty much the entire budget right there , the locations . The acting is pretty bad by the main cast , I just hated all the fake put on crying & screaming that didn't convince at all but did irritate immensely . Five Across the Eyes will go down as one of the worst films I have ever seen & I have seen a few films , whenever anyone now ask 's me what 's the worst film I have ever seen Five Across the Eyes will definitely get a mention . I hated it , every single aspect & wretched moment of it .  
1	  The first time I came upon Delirious , I only heard it . I listened to the entire comedic performance and never have I laughed so much in my life . Eddie 's ability to paint hilarious pictures in our minds and do great imitation is captivating . When I finally got to see him perform this act , I had to have it . Eddie Murphy 's performance on Delirious shows his genius ! With it being the new millennium , his acts in 1983 is just as funny today as it was then . My parents loved it as teenagers and I ( age eighteen ) love it as well . From that point on , I had to view Murphy 's other movies such as Coming To America and Harlem Nights . There will be no other comedian like Eddie .  
0	  I really do not have any clue as to why some people find the power rangers television show even remotely interesting at all . The costumes are completely ridiculous and the people playing in them also look completely foolish at the same time . There is absolutely anything remotely interesting about the power rangers . This is just a higher priced television commercial designed to sell extremely cheesy plastic garbage to the unsuspecting children around the world . From the notes , I can see that it 's been banned in the country of New Zealand and from what I have seen , I can agree with their decision . Avoid this show at all costs , it 's terrible and ridiculous .  
0	  Yes , this movie is a real thief . It stole some shiny Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war-hero movie to boost the acceptance ( support ? ) for the wars U.S. is still fighting today . I do not really want to go here into politics , but come on , this is more clear than the summer sky . Hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding , no real plot at all . I really feel myself in the 50 's of Hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like . The same propaganda movies were produced that time , only with the exception that those were black and white . Even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the " U.S. wars are cool " genre , you surely have much better movies to choose from .  
1	  I was so glad I came across this short film . I 'm always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across , so when I saw this and saw that it was nominated for the Live Action Short Film at the Academy Awards , I was so pleased that I actually had a film that I was rooting for . The plot is pretty simple , the director , writer , and star Nacho Vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals . The result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy . It 's a well made short film , well edited and the actors all do a great job . And the last shot of the film is perfect . I highly recommend this film .  
0	  somewhere i 'd read that this film is supposed to be a comedy . after seeing it , i 'd call it anything but . the point of this movie eludes me . the dialogue is all extremely superficial and absurd , many of the sets seemed to be afterthoughts , and despite all the nudity and implied sexual content , there 's nothing erotic about this film .. all leaving me to wonder just what the heck this thing is about ! the title premise could have been the basis for a fun ( if politically incorrect ) comedy . instead , we 're treated to cheap , amateurish , unfinished sketches and depravity and weirdness for its own sake . if i want that , i 'll go buy a grace jones cd .  
1	  This is a very engrossing BBC-TV mini-series which is loosely based upon a mysterious disappearance of a young mother , but the series is really more of a study of the assorted characters in the story , which lasts for five hours . It is thus very much an ensemble piece , where the wide variety of brilliant British actors and actresses can show off their talents . The actual characters portrayed are really ' the kind of people one does not normally meet ' , people so boring and nondescript that it is difficult to admire them . For instance , the lead character is a young husband ( the one whose wife disappears ) who has no job and no apparent interest in finding any . He lives off handouts from his parents-in-law . He was once in the Army but does not appear to have the slightest flicker of any ambition or any interests in life apart from doting on his small family . He is played by David Oyelowo , who is brilliant at the part , coming across as a totally sympathetic person , although his only activities for five hours are loving and grieving , which he does superbly , so that one wants to comfort him , as he is so obviously a nice guy . The standout performance of the whole series is unquestionably Penelope Wilton , who acts circles round everyone else in the story . She is simply incredible . She portrays a very unsympathetic woman , indeed the only character in the story who is all too familiar to everyone , namely an irrational , hysterical , self-centred , dense , querulous , blindly loving and blindly hating , elderly idiot-woman . Alas , alas , we know them too well . Wilton is one of Britain 's finest actresses ( see my review of her in ' Half Broken Things ' ) . She takes a character who could have been two-dimensional and makes her four-dimensional . She is wonderfully supported by old pro Patrick Malahide , who plays her exasperated husband , and the pair of them set a high standard indeed for all the younger players . Janet McTeer , a spectacular actress when younger , has become a much less sympathetic type of person now that she is older , has coarsened in some way , and puts one off , but she redeems herself in the latter stages of the story by showing how brilliant an actress she can be when she has a chance by pulling off one of the most convincing and original drunk scenes I have ever seen on film . The big surprise is the enigmatic character Sarah , played with great depth and originality by actress Sarah Smart . She takes a character who could have been insufferably tedious and by sheer acting magic turns her into a deeply mysterious and intriguing person , about whom we wonder tirelessly for the entire five hours . She is so good at it that we end up wondering about Sarah Smart , frankly . I guess that 's what happens when you really do your job properly , that people wonder where the character ends and the actress begins , if she knows herself , that is , and many do not . She has some deeply unnerving tricks with her eyes , which wobble and let us know she is unhinged , but we are not sure how or why , though we eventually learn that she had an extremely violent and traumatic childhood . Her mastery of ambiguous facial expressions is extraordinary . Rory Kinnear is amazingly convincing as an apparently hopeless fellow who lives with his mum and isn't up to much , but who turns out to have hidden depths . ( I suppose most people have hidden depths , but do we want to plumb them , that is the question . ) His mum is played very well indeed by Margot Leicester . A superb performance is given by Lucinda Dryzek , who plays a snotty , revolting teenage girl of the sort we all dread to meet , but who at crucial moments collapses in helpless tears and turns out to be pathetic , with all her arrogance just a pose . Three other children are also very good , Lucinda 's friend , and her younger half-brother and half-sister . The younger siblings may be very dim indeed as characters in the story ( they seem unable to say anything particularly articulate , being hopeless witnesses to the disappearance ) , with little to recommend them but their sweet natures , but that is conveyed to wonderful effect by Lee Massey as the boy and Tyler Anthony as the girl . Harriet Walter has a small role , but we do not get to see much of her , which is a shame , as she is such a fine actress that she was wasted here . One could go on , but one must draw a line somewhere . The series manages to be strangely fascinating because of the depth of portrayal of all these essentially uninteresting people caught up in a web of intense anxiety and suspense .  
1	  This is an extremely-powerful based on a true story film that can be infuriating to watch . I say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people , in this case an innocent Australian couple charged with killing their baby . Meryl Streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but I thought Sam Neill was just as good . Let 's just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for Streep because she had to learn an Australian accent . ( She learned it so well I had trouble understanding her in parts . ) Without giving anything away , all I can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally .  
1	  CREEP is a straight up serious horror film set in real time that wants nothing more than to just show people get attacked in a empty subway platform by a mutant for 85 minutes . And it does just that . Nothing more , nothing less . Director Christopher Smith draws out the drama a far as he plausibly can by introducing a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be in the subway after it is locked . He also leaves the origins of the titular Creep deliberately vague ( unlawful experiments happening in the 60s underground are hinted at ) and that little bit of mystery works for the most part . Sadly , he undermines himself toward the end by actually holding back from a twist ending where more genetic malformations would appear ( they are hinted at as well ) . Yes , you heard me right - I wanted a clichéd twist ending ! Franka ( RUN LOLA RUN ) Potente is good as the terrorized female lead and the rest of the cast is fine .  
0	  This movie was disgusting . Their should be a warning that some sadistic nasty writer is attempting to make a name for herself before being held hostage for an hour and a half watching garbage . What is garbage ? The misuse of peoples time , the misuse of energy , and the waste of whatever type of educational system that taught her how to read and write . Talia you are a sick demented loser . Your psychiatrist needs to prescribe stronger medications for your problem . The acting and plot gave me no choice but to fast forward through the middle of the garbage . I ended up at a scene that was uncalled for . If you want to learn how to shock people watch a Larry Clark movie . I lost all respect for the entire cast of this movie " no more support from me . " How could actors or actresses sit on a set while such gross depictions of human behavior is manifested from the mind of a psycho ? I feel sorry for all actors that took part in that scene . I think the devil now knows who the writer of this movie is ; congratulations you won his attention .  
0	  The mind boggles at exactly what about Universal Soldier merited a sequel . Since the real star , Dolph Lundgren , would not be able to reprise his role from the original , there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off . Bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler Bill Goldberg and martial arts expert Michael Jai White . To their credit , they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement . Bill Goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film , and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role . For once , his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times , and it does not get irritating . The problem from the audience 's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes Lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films . And therein lies the problem . You do not go to see a Van Damme film because you want serious action . You go because you want comedy , however unintentional . Unbeknownst to many people , Universal Soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels . I have only seen the first , which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke . Matt Battaglia was so terrible in the role of Luc Deveraux that for once in his career , the sight of Jean-Claude Van Damme comes as a welcome relief . The film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels , and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original . After years of investigation and explanation , the Unisol project is still going ahead , with some minor modifications . For one , the new Unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins . For another , all of the Unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called SETH . In the early parts of the film , SETH exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome . Being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes , we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut . The Unisol project is on the chopping block , which essentially means that SETH will be turned off . SETH , somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained , decides to mobilise the Unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down . His only problem is that every so often , a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown . Two individuals possess the code in question . SETH kills the first in short order , and those who are familiar with the plot kit that Van Damme 's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be . The rest of the film revolves around the Unisols ' attempts to get the code out of Van Damme without injuring him too badly . A subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film , but it adds about as much to the story as Van Damme does to the profession of acting . The film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés . When SETH transplants his command module into the body of Michael Jai White , we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over . He goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity 's weakness ( es ) . Gee , SETH , you mean they will not be our strong points ? All kidding aside , the short length of the film is both the film 's weakness and its strength . It leaves the action without adequate setup . In the original , we are given a very thorough explanation of the Unisols , how they work , and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film . Here , the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a Unisol is and how they operate . At least in the original , a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice . Here , one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform ( and presumably his body ) , getting up every time without stopping for breath . I tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner . If you can see it on the cheap , knock yourself out . This is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of Mystery Science Theatre .  
1	  I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco Cinemas when it came out , back in ' 02 . I was only 13 at the time , but even then I liked it . It had some sort of warmth . We 've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it , it never gets boring . This is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3D animations made at the time - The characters have no particular ' home ' which they leave . They are nomads , and that 's really refreshing and uplifting to watch . Also , each individual character on the surface , appear to be just putting up with each other , but they 're really all good friends . As well , all of the characters have their own charms ( even the bad guys ) . Sid the sloth is charming in his annoying , over-affectionate and naive sort of way . Manny is adorable in his depressed , reclusive character , and so on and so forth . Another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation . All the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay , giving the film an artistic edge . Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie , is that gender means very little . There are hardly any female characters , but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film . Due to this , there 's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age . All in all , Ice Age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out .  
1	  I LOVE Jack 's jokes like ' The cliché is .. ' or " Over the top cliché guy , black , oily skin , kinda spooky .. " . He is just hilarious ! Daniel 's starting to catch up on him to ! Good thing Jack 's not on the team anymore ( in a way ) or else it would have been sarcasm mania ! I just love all the plots ( season 8 , a little less , I have to admit ) , the characters are great , the actors are great , I 'm starting to pick up facial expressions ( and more ) from Jack , Daniel and Teal'c .. It just all theoretically possible and exciting .. oops ! Their I go again ! Sorry , I 'm also starting to pick up traits from Carter , and all of this is driving my parents NUTZ ! Well , to conclude , I think it 's good for another three seasons or so , especially if they keep on packing the episodes with all this humor , drama , action and so forth !  
0	  This movie was one of the greatest movies ever made , it had everything to make a movie great . Incredible acting , awesome special effects .. oh wait I must be thinking of a good movie . Well this wasn't one of them , it just plain sucked . What I want to know is , what kind of bone head would think that this movie was a 10 . When I casted my vote there were 206 out there , god knows what goes on in their head . Now as for any other vote , a 8 or 9 was even too high , but a 10 ? Come on , what made this movie soo good to give it a 10 ? I know these are the same 206 that thought that Jean Claude Van Damme is a great dramatic actor .  
1	  Why this movie has all but disappeared into obscurity is an absolute crime . " Conan " is perhaps the only Sword and Sorcery movie better . The brutal violence , cool character designs , and good pacing , make this one of the best fantasies around . It is certainly the greatest animated movie aimed at a more adult audience that I have ever seen . This is not similar to Bakshi 's usual frenetic style . It 's quite a departure for Bakshi , and in my opinion his best work . I hope that this film gets the recognition it deserves .  
0	  I think that if I went to a first school somewhere deep in the countryside and asked the bottom set of English to come up with a script , it would make more sense than this . I could then go to the first year drama group and they would act it out better than the jokers in this film . This sounds really mean , but I 'm certain that they made this as a joke and are entirely aware that they possess ( see what I did there ? ) neither the skills to act or to write anything , ever . Watch this only if you 're incredibly drunk , high or in need of a good excuse as to why your decaying corpse was found with slit wrists . I will now go to my fish bowl and collect all of the poo at the bottom . After that , I will mould it into the shape of a disc and put it into my DVD player , fully expecting it to produce something far better than this trumpery . Acting - 0/10 Plot - LOL / 10 Breasts - 9/10  
1	  First saw this gem from Joe Sarno way back when , and I must say that after seeing it , I could never forget Jennifer Welles . At first I thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a Sarno film , but when Jennifer made her entrance , the first time I ever saw her anywhere , I was sat up and took notice . Her presence in this film is hard to avoid , and spices up every scene she 's involved in . I 've seen most of the rest of Sarno 's films , and the other films starring or featuring Jennifer Welles , and I must say that this was both Sarno and Jennifer at their collective best . Sarno 's direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb , and Jennifer showed ( figuratively and literally ) an acting prowess that make this a must see . Co-stars Rebecca Brooke ( aka Mary Mendum ) and Chris Jordan , both frequent co-stars of Ms . Welles , and also frequent stars of Sarno 's work , turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous , yet normal housewives . This film is Sarno classic .  
1	  When I was a little girl ( and my dad owned a video store ) , this was among my favorite movies . I hadn't heard much about it since then , nor did I really remember anything about it , it having been forgotten in the wake of Don Bluth 's other , probably better films . I managed to track it down a few weeks ago , however , and was pleasantly surprised again . Set in New Orleans in the 1930s , the animation is delightful and the songs are memorable . There are a few goofs in continuity if you look hard enough , but they generally don't detract from the storyline , which leaves you smiling ( and maybe even a little misty-eyed , if you are a lover of animals ) . The characters are believable ( maybe even a little too grown-up for younger watchers ) , as well . Two paws up , and for those of you who haven't seen it in a while , definitely worth a re-watch .  
0	  Very funny to watch " Beretta 's Island " as kind of natural trash-film . It is like answer to Jess Franko 's type of b-movie . Bodybuilders strikes back ( ! face to face ! ) to pushers . The very very very stupid strike ! Action : unbelievably bad directed firing ( shooting ) scenes look even better than hand-to-hand fighting . Chasing scenes ridiculous . Saving beauties scenes incredibly stupid . Erotic scenes are very unerotic . The main luck of film is pretty landscapes and festival scenes . Don't miss : Arnold Schwarzenegger 's joke at start of film and list of Franco Columbu 's kin at the end . Special attraction : naked bosom . Almoust forgot - Franco can sing !  
1	  The movie " Atlantis : The Lost Empire " is a shining gem in the rubble of films produced by the Disney Studios recently . Parents who have had to sit through " The Jungle Book 2 " or even a Pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one . The film is one of few to attempt at an original story ; previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories . Films such as " Toy Story " , " Finding Nemo " , and " Monsters Inc . " all do the same , but it must be noted that all were made by Pixar and only distributed by Disney . Recent films from the Disney Studios are mostly released direct to video , and are sequels to an existing successful film . The quality of those films is given way to the profitability . A new era started with " Atlantis " following it were " Mulan " , " Lilo & Stitch " , and most recently " Open Range " . The writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past . A good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find Atlantis , a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years . Including that of young Milo Thatch , voiced by Michael J. Fox . Milo is employed by a museum in Washington D.C .. His grandfather was a renowned archaeologist , who had devoted his life to discovering Atlantis . This was seen as a waste by his peers , and they wish Milo to not follow in his footsteps . After failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition , Milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment . She takes him to her employer , a Mr. Whitmore . Whitmore was a close friend of Milo 's grandfather , and wishes to send Milo with a team to locate Atlantis . Mr. Whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything . The crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers . The journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch . The viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach Atlantis . The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery Atlantis , not just the discovery of people . It is enough to keep the interest of the older audience . The animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation . The movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with Computer Generated Images . A feat not easily achieved , most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two . The characters are believably human . There are some nice chase type scenes , with lots of action going on . A few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get . The creativity of the writers really shines through . The culture of Atlantis is richly developed , including an entire language . The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources , such as Plato . The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained . Believable , if by a younger audience , that magic really does exist . The powers of the people of Atlantis are not exactly presented as magic , but can best be described in this way . Although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic . The voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of Captain Nemo 's nautilus , complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes . The giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology . The female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been , even holding roles in leadership . This is not a bad thing . It gives a good role model for my daughter to look to , rather than an all male cast . One reason this film is a favorite of mine over other Disney films is that there is not one single song , ever . A tradition that began with the first feature film , " Snow White " , and carried on through to " The Lion King " , almost every Disney film is full of upbeat songs . This is great and all , what would the Seven Dwarfs be without " Hi HO ! " ? After the millionth time through it 'd almost be better without , but this one spares the parent . Not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song . I for one am grateful . The storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike . It is a film I am willing to watch again and again with my children .  
1	  Corean cinema can be quite surprising for an occidental audience , because of the multiplicity of the tones and genres you can find in the same movie . In a Coreen drama such as this " Secret Sunshine " , you 'll also find some comical parts , thriller scenes and romantic times . " There 's not only tragedy in life , there 's also tragic-comedy " says at one point of the movie the character interpreted by Song Kang-ho , summing up the mixture of the picture . But don't get me wrong , this heterogeneity of the genres the movie deals with , adds veracity to the experience this rich movie offers to its spectators . That doesn't mean that it lacks unity : on the contrary , it 's rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in pain . Shin-ae , who 's in quest for a quiet life with her son in the native town of her late husband , really gives , by all the different faces of suffering she 's going through , unity to this movie . It 's realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through . Denial , lost , anger , faith , pert of reality : the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses , and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experience . The only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience ( the woman wears the mask of tragedy , the man represents the comical interludes ) and to let the artifices of the movie touch you . I must say that some parts of the movie really did move me ( especialy in the beginning ) , particularly those concerning the unability of Chang Joan to truly help the one he loves , but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end . Nevertheless , some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising ( the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing ) . This kind of scenes makes " Secret Sunshine " the melo equivalent of " The Host " for horror movies or " Memories of murder " for thrillers . These movies are indeed surprising , most original , aesthetically incredible , and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with . The only thing that " Secret Sunshine " forgets , as " The host " forgot to be scary , is to make its audience cry : bad point for a melodrama , but good point for a good film .  
1	  When I heard Patrick Swayze was finally returning to his acting career with KING SOLOMON 'S MINES I was very excited . I was expecting a great Indiana Jones type action adventure . What I got was a 4 hour long ( with commercials ) epic that was very slow . The second and third hour could have been dropped altogether and the story would not have suffered for it . The ending was good ( no spoilers here ) but I was still left wanting more . Well all a guy can do is prey that Swayze does " RoadHouse 2 " so he can get back into the action genre that made him famous . Until than if your a fan of King Solomon 's Mines than read the book or watch the 1985 version with Richard Chamberlain and Sharon Stone which is also not very good but its only and hour and forty minutes of your life gone instead of 4 hours .  
1	  I think it 's one of the greatest movies which are ever made , and I 've seen many .. The book is better , but it 's still a very good movie !  
0	  Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past . If such a film is shown to people again , it would surely click provided if it has something new , fresh and captivating for today 's challenging audiences . This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her film 's principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend . She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting . Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format . Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser . If someone were to state a positive aspect of Sylke Enders ' film , it may well be Kroko 's involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment . It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows .  
1	  Most people know Paul Verhoeven as the director of many good ( and bad ) sci-fi movies in Hollywood . But long before that he was churning out generic thrillers in his native land . The story is a basic femme fatale premise , nothing new or enthralling . Verhoeven thinks he can make it better by adding in a series of dream sequences , which instead of defining our main character and his situation , are just used as a way to drive forward the predictable plot . The screenplay was solid , the dialogue helping to pad the effects of the bland story . What really made the movie at at least good was some terrific acting . Jereone Krabbe was amazing as the " tortured artist " , and the supporters were very good as well . Also , Jan De Bont 's cinematography adds at least some life to the film , helping to make Verhoeven look at least capable as a director . 6.5/10 * * 1/2 / * * * *  
0	  Live ! Yes , but not kicking . True story : Some time ago , a Dutch TV station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show . A contest rather . The main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure . For real . The country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd , saying it was appalling , immoral , what is this world coming to , and the like . In a way , I had to agree . As the months passed , the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not , instead of running the country . The show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead . And up to the last moment the country was up in arms , the Prime Minister making speeches , every newspaper writing about it , everyone in the country holding their breaths . And the network pushed on . Towards a new frontier in television . And they definitely succeeded in doing just that . They pushed the envelope . The show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live , whilst she would die shortly after . And then , in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax . The woman was not ill , but all the candidates were . There was no kidney auction . The whole show , that , with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions , built up for months to a fantastic climax , was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors . The man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney disease . Now THIS is television . Leaving everybody far behind in amazement . Don't give me a poorly acted , poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a Russian Roulette show on American TV . As if . * Spoiler * As if I 'm going to believe they would get this through the FCC . As if I 'm going to believe this would get through the US Supreme Court on the basis of free expression . As if I 'm gonna believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on air . It 's all been done before . Watch Running Man with Arnold instead . At least it had a semi good ending . * Spoiler * This is an appallingly bad piece of film , together with a ridiculous ending . So she gets shot in the end , is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice ? Don't take my word for it , but I would say this : leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead , you 'll get more quality .  
0	  This movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Hollywood . The fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business . The idea that audiences paid to see this movie ( and like an idiot I rented the film ) is discouraging also . Obsessed teacher ( 3 years prior ) kills teenager 's family because he wants her . For no reason he kills the mother , father and brother . From the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction . Years later , obsessed teacher breaks out of prison . HMM-usual bad writing-no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute . Obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a Navy SEAL and can sneak around , sniff out people and with a knife is super killer . Sure ! Now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason , knifes bellhop for the fun of it , and starts to hunt down the teenager 's friends . Now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you . Obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel-again it is stupid , ever cop would know his face-but he walks right by them . Now he kills two cops outside teenager 's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend . There is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage . If any other profession put out work of this low quality , they would be fired . Yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash .  
1	  Michael Caton-Jones 's Scottish period piece bears little connection to the Sir Walter Scott novel of the same name .. The film opens in the Scottish highlands , with Robert Roy McGregor and his men hunting down a bunch of cow thieves who have stolen several heads of His Lordship James Graham 's cattle .. The scene then switches to a sword-fighting contest attended by noblemen with longhair wigs , adorned shirts , soft colored coats , paleface make-up and conventional gestures .. MacGregor lives under the protection of a local lord named Marquis of Montrose .. When he enters an ill-advised trade agreement with Montrose , he innocently leaves himself exposed to the malicious plots of Montrose 's evil-doers .. The unfolding of their perfidy is the most creative and pleasant part of the movie , though it takes a repugnant turn with a violent rape .. When Rob Roy is finally compelled to rebel against the English soldiers , the action becomes well understood , ending with the predictable duel between him and an expert with the blade .. Liam Neeson injects heroism and passion to his character .. He is intelligent , fair and virile .. He carries his height with grace as the Scottish chieftain of a small community .. He is a loving father , a passionate lover , and a noble husband , driven to desperate acts by dastardly villains .. He 'd rather die than tell a lie or betray a trust .. Oscar winner Jessica Lange gives the film class as the strong robust devoted wife , a proud peasant woman , brutally raped by an icy psychotic aristocrat .. Lange 's lines are filled with dignity and integrity : ' I will think on you dead , until my husband makes you so . And then I will think on you no more . ' John Hurt brings his usual clever touch with character roles to make Montrose something more than a greedy Marquis , ruthless with money and tempered by the English court 's fashion for foppery .. He is a pompous arrogant man with two villainous servants at his service .. Honor , in his view , seems a quaint notion .. He has two objectives : ruin the reputation of his rival , the Duke of Argyle , and to hunt down the fugitive MacGregor .. He sends his soldiers to burn the Highlanders ' homes , to kill their people and their livestock .. Tim Roththe perfect antithesis to the hero , is fearsome and strangely an effeminate enforcer .. He is a penniless British aristocrat , a nasty ' hired sword ' wonderfully evil , ravishing and murdering his way through the Scottish mist .. His name is Archibald Cunningham .. He turns out to be a liar , a thief and a murderer .. He dismisses himself as ' but a bastard abroad , seeking his fortune and the favors of great men , " and therefore can't care about anyone else : " Love is a dung hill and I am but a cock that climbs upon it to crow . " He even jokes that he once raped a young boy whom he mistook for a girl .. Cunningham seems pathetic .. He smiles foolishly , and utters words with affected refinement , but not terribly harmful-until a muscular swordsman insults him , and we discover that he 's a cool head and an expert with a sword .. He really does steal the film with a performance that earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination .. And while Brian Cox is suitably odious as Killearn , Andrew Keir is Montrose 's rival , the powerful local aristocrat , the Duke of Argyll , one of the few trustworthy men McGregor meets outside his own family .. Set in 18th-century Scotland , and with an atmospheric musical score , ' Rob Roy ' is really a love story between a man and his wife , a recognizably human story , unjustly dwarfed by Mel Gibson 's ' Braveheart , ' that does tell essentially the same story of provincial resentment of overbearing English landlords ..  
1	  In the areas where they overlap this fine movie is light years ahead of 2004s Innocence , which gave the impression of a rheumy eye and heavy breathing ogling young girls . Here the effect is much more realistic and really gets inside the heads of the three protagonists as they fumble their way through an adolescence riddled with pitfalls . The three principals , all unknown to me give very sure-footed performances , the kind , in fact , that may be so natural that it will be difficult for them to replicate this quality of acting in other films so I wouldn't be too surprised if they are not heard from again . It would be nice if this could get away from the Art Houses and into the Multiplexes where there 's just an outside chance it might ' speak ' to the bubblegum crowd it isn't aimed at .  
0	  With the exception of about 10 sublime minutes with HB Warner on the celestial train , this was 94 minutes of jaw-dropping horribleness ! The acting was atrocious , but the story is what I really found appalling . The acting was wooden and stilted , even by early talkies standards ( the exceptions being Lee Tracy and HB Warner , neither of whom can do wrong ) . Rose Hobart was absolutely horrid and lifeless as Julie ( as she likewise was in 1932 's Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde , an otherwise excellent flick ) . And the rest of the cast was worse , there being no words to describe their awfulness . Worse than the acting , however , was the story . For some unknown reason , Julie loves Liliom , a cad and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever . He marries Julie but doesn't support her , instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his low-life criminal pal ( Lee Tracy ) . And , oh yeah , he never has a kind word to say to Julie and he regularly beats her . Julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him , which only seems to make him more abusive . What 's even sicker is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story . Somehow we are supposed to see Julie as a noble character whose pure love redeems Liliom . WTF ? The last 1/3 of this movie takes place after Liliom has killed himself ( a robbery plot goes awry and Liliom plunges a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police ) . As he lay dying , he tells Julie " I beat you all the time , but I 'm not sorry for it . " When he at last dies , she finally tells him she loves him . ( Neither character ever said " I love you " to the other while they were alive . ) After his death , God 's Chief Magistrate gives Liliom one more day on earth so that he can " do something good " for his unborn daughter . The price for this is 10 years in hell . After 10 years , Liliom is allowed one day on earth to see his now 10-yr-old daughter . He approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to cajole her into letting him " do something good " for her ; he tries to get her to play cards , he tries to give her Gabriel 's horn , but she 's not interested and rebuffs him . So he slaps her . He . Slaps . Her . And then he disappears back to the afterlife . Looking on , we see his daughter tell Julie about this . The girl says the slap didn't hurt , that it felt like a kiss . This is supposed to be the movie 's magical moment . The girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible , and Julie replies that " someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all . " Then the music swells and Liliom rides up to heaven in the celestial train . BLECH ! There was one saving grace to this film , and that is the interview between the Chief Magistrate ( HB Warner was truly magnificent here ) and Liliom on the celestial train . The Magistrate had some very profound things to say to Liliom about life and second chances and death . This scene alone made me bump this rating from 1 to 2 stars . Regarding Liliom 's suicide as a means for escaping his problems , the Magistrate says " People suppose that when they die , their difficulties are ended for them . You thought that by killing yourself that you would cancel all your responsibilities . It is not as simple as that . On Earth your name is still spoken ; your face is still remembered . As long as one is left who remembers you , so long is the matter unended . Until you have been completely forgotten , you will not be finished with the Earth , even though you are dead . " Some great sublime transcendental stuff amongst some of the most horrible trash I 've ever seen . By the way , this story has apparently been filmed many times both as " Liliom " and as the musical " Carousel . "  
1	  Homelessness ( or Houselessness as George Carlin stated ) has been an issue for years but never a plan to help those on the street that were once considered human who did everything from going to school , work , or vote for the matter . Most people think of the homeless as just a lost cause while worrying about things such as racism , the war on Iraq , pressuring kids to succeed , technology , the elections , inflation , or worrying if they 'll be next to end up on the streets . But what if you were given a bet to live on the streets for a month without the luxuries you once had from a home , the entertainment sets , a bathroom , pictures on the wall , a computer , and everything you once treasure to see what it 's like to be homeless ? That is Goddard Bolt 's lesson . Mel Brooks ( who directs ) who stars as Bolt plays a rich man who has everything in the world until deciding to make a bet with a sissy rival ( Jeffery Tambor ) to see if he can live in the streets for thirty days without the luxuries ; if Bolt succeeds , he can do what he wants with a future project of making more buildings . The bet 's on where Bolt is thrown on the street with a bracelet on his leg to monitor his every move where he can't step off the sidewalk . He 's given the nickname Pepto by a vagrant after it 's written on his forehead where Bolt meets other characters including a woman by the name of Molly ( Lesley Ann Warren ) an ex-dancer who got divorce before losing her home , and her pals Sailor ( Howard Morris ) and Fumes ( Teddy Wilson ) who are already used to the streets . They 're survivors . Bolt isn't . He 's not used to reaching mutual agreements like he once did when being rich where it 's fight or flight , kill or be killed . While the love connection between Molly and Bolt wasn't necessary to plot , I found " Life Stinks " to be one of Mel Brooks ' observant films where prior to being a comedy , it shows a tender side compared to his slapstick work such as Blazing Saddles , Young Frankenstein , or Spaceballs for the matter , to show what it 's like having something valuable before losing it the next day or on the other hand making a stupid bet like all rich people do when they don't know what to do with their money . Maybe they should give it to the homeless instead of using it like Monopoly money . Or maybe this film will inspire you to help others .  
0	  I don't want to go off on a rant here , but .. this is the worst " film " I 've ever seen . Worse than The Avengers . Incompetent directing , disjointed writing , and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout . Shot on very cheap video , it looks like a high school project , but without the emotion . The lighting frequently looks like a single Sun-Gun . The sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera , but everything else about this thing is just awful . The plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution , the techie elements are patently absurd , and the editing looks worse than a rough cut . It 's not even bad enough to be funny . It 's just bad . BTW , the packaging is intentionally misleading . Lion 's Gate owes me $ 4.00 .  
1	  This amazing Oscar winner ( 4 in total ) and John Ford 's first Academy Award winner , is simply spellbinding with a pounding score by Max Steiner . Called an Art film , because Ford had very little money to make this great story about guilt and retribution , and greed and stupidity . But what makes this movie such a classic , is the direction and astounding photography and use of fog and lighting , that was so different from the usual American film , and more in the tradition of German expressionism . And the Oscar winning performance by Victor McLaglen as the drunken Gypo is simply unbelievable . Basically the movie takes place in Ireland , and Gypo turns in a friend in the rebel movement to the English to collect 20 pounds to give to his girlfriend . But having all that money , he starts blowing it on an all night drunk and giving it away , while the leaders of the movement are trying to track down the informer . The whole movie is one night in a dark and foggy Ireland , and a cast of characters that are memorable but all along , the whole world of Gypo is closing in on him , both psychologically . If I had to pick maybe three directors to have ALL their movies on a deserted island forever , and nobody elses , John Ford would certainly be one of them . What a truly remarkable movie ..  
1	  This review comes nearly 30 years late . Nevertheless , it has to be mentioned that I chanced by a copy of this movie sometime in early 2008 and watched it repeatedly for 4 months straight ! I just had to write about it ! I got smitten and forgot anything else existed once I saw this movie . How ironic it is to see Literature 's ugliest male protagonist portrayed by the handsomest man ! yet , what a welcome irony ! It suited me perfectly and more so because Timothy Dalton did full justice to his role . He delivered an astounding and triumphant performance ! I have never seen anything like it ! All the other actors are very good too . The whole movie was put together beautifully . I don't care what anyone says about this movie . I just love it and love it ! It made me happy and satisfied . It crushes me a bit to say this but I prefer Jane Eyre 1983 to A & E 's P & J , which I believe is the ultimate mini-series . The excerpts from Jane Eyre spooked me a little back in school . I never got around to reading the book seriously knowing the story line so well . Seeing this particular production made the story come to life for me and drove me to a near frenzy . The scenes and Mr. Dalton 's voice haunted me endlessly and finally led me to read the book seriously , which , of course is a masterpiece . Bravo to the whole team and especially to Mr. Dalton ! This movie is now a part of me . I give it 10/10 rating .  
1	  Lost , probably the best t . v series ever made . the storyline is clever and when all your questions are answered watching one episode , 100 more are raised . if lost can carry on it 's magnificent ways and not get too carried away then it will be stapled the best show ever . The survivors of a plane crash are forced to live with each other on a remote island , a dangerous new world that poses unique threats of its own . after reading this your thinking how on earth can that be interesting ? and heres your answer , every season SO FAR has always been full of surprises , your always questioning your self why did that just happened and what 's gonna happen next each time , very unexpected thing 's happen and the story goes on wonderfully SO FAR ! The series just sucks you in , it 's chilling and very addictive , everything from the wonderful creators and directing to the magnificent performances by the cast creates a very believable story . Lost is simply unbelievable , amazing , highly entertaining , top notch , t . v at it 's best . How ever you want to put it . Lost beat 's all other show 's by a landslide . And if your hating or criticising Lost you don't know how to watch t . v or watch drama . Lost simply doesn't disappoint , you would think a series carrying on for so long can't keep getting better . But it does ! It just keep 's on flowing it 's unlike anything you would ever think off . " Every thing happens for a reason . " And that is truly shown in the series . Eventually you will reach a point were all the clues and everything that 's happened or being done adds up . You will feel and realise how the characters have changed and how and why everything is going on . The 10 minutes of excitement : You see something you didn't see coming , something major has happened to character or on the island . There 's hope somewhere . You see a major twist that can or will change everything . You hear your thought 's churn , you wonder what 's gonna happen next . Your heart beating .

Everyone has there show that they are addicted too , that they can't get enough of , that they admire every minute and can't wait for the next episode , That they talk about 24/7 . Too me and many others it 's this series . Lost . Once you start watching , you won't get enough . The creators did a flawless job . Lost is completely unique and original , you won't see anything like it . The clever idea of " flashbacks and flashforwards " and something major and different in every season sucks your thoughts . Would they ever make a series like " LOST " ? Something so interesting and something you will always remember . It simply has stunned the world when it hit t . v . A new generation of dramatic / sci-fi . A instant classic before it reached out to the viewers . I 'm sure you all heard of lost and it 's 5 star reviews , and your annoying friend that won't stop telling you about it , so what 's stopping you from watching ? Every episode leads to something new and it just doesn't stop getting better and better , you get more interested as it goes along , you learn things that are on the island that you wouldn't even think off . The characters start to become very likable , and if your the critic type you would love to see Lost in further detail , things like how the relationship between characters develop and how they learn the ways to under look and take on challenges from the Island . All together it 's a great drama and a flawless series . I guess we just all hope that lost will not have a downfall in the episodes to come and go to far .. so if you don't watch lost , read the comment from the top again and you should change your mind . Seeing is believing , so until you start watching you will never know . I strongly recommend this masterpiece of series : LOST ! start watching ! You have not seen nothing until you watch LOST !  
1	  There is no relation at all between Fortier and Profiler but the fact that both are police series about violent crimes . Profiler looks crispy , Fortier looks classic . Profiler plots are quite simple . Fortier 's plot are far more complicated .. Fortier looks more like Prime Suspect , if we have to spot similarities .. The main character is weak and weirdo , but have " clairvoyance " . People like to compare , to judge , to evaluate . How about just enjoying ? Funny thing too , people writing Fortier looks American but , on the other hand , arguing they prefer American series ( ! ) . Maybe it 's the language , or the spirit , but I think this series is more English than American . By the way , the actors are really good and funny . The acting is not superficial at all ..  
0	  PLEASE TAKE A MINUTE TO READ MY ENTIRE REVIEW . I AM NOT KNOCKING THE FILM ITSELF - ONLY THE DVD VERSIONS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE . * I really wanted to give this film even two stars . I mean how could it possibly rank a mere 1 out of 10 ! ? ! Here 's how : An epic film adaptation of Tolstoy 's novel " War and Peace " with historically accurate battle scenes , courtesy of the Red Army , and an extremely faithful , scene-for-scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult but worth sitting through for seven hours - if that 's what you were seeing . The trouble is you can't see that film - anywhere as far as I know . I am attempting to watch the RusCiCo DVD version - widely considered the best version available since it 's letter boxed and restores the scenes that were cut from other DVD releases . But , it is one of the worst film prints I 've ever seen transfered to DVD . The picture is muddy and inconsistent , often strobing . It 's almost tolerable if you crank your brightness , color and picture levels up to maximum .. but the problem doesn't end there . The sound is also way inconsistent , blaringly loud in parts , virtually inaudible in others . And as for languages , it 's a HUGE problem for English speakers - the dubbed option has some good actors , and some really terrible ones whose performance grates , and parts of the film just aren't dubbed at all , slipping back into Russian and even French randomly . The subtitled option isn't much better . The subtitles don't appear below the image , but right over it - obscuring some of the beauty ( or what 's left of it ) in the scenery . Furthermore , the subtitles are often a poor translation ( a shame given that the script took pains to hew so close to Tolstoy 's actual words ) , and the subtitles too seem to just drop out in parts . So , even if you max out the color , brightness and picture settings , and turn the volume way up , and choose subtitled * and * English dubbed , you 're still going to get a film that 's annoying to watch and listen to . Can it 's content overcome that ? It might have been able to , but at seven hours - who can stand it for that long ? Maybe someday , someone will come along and restore this - and maybe then I will see a masterpiece - but for now , I just can't give more than one star to something I 've only been able to stand watching about the first 12 % of .  
1	  A Disney movie that dares to do something different should at least be awarded for effort . " Holes " doesn't make the same mistakes as one would expect from a Disney movie about troubled teenagers put in a camp . For the first time events are not explained in details . The flashback scenes really do serve a purpose and present several mature topics that may surprise the viewer . I must admit that at first I was a bit put off by the seriousness of the movie . But soon I realized that we had to endure those moments to see the beauty of the story . Besides the story this movie also does a good job of questioning some methods that are used in correctional facilities . ( One example where Caveman is forbidden to teach Zero to read because they have to dig holes in order to build character , like learning to read won't contribute to that ) . " Holes " is a movie that is smart and beautiful . A must watch !  
1	  Nothing revolutionary here ; just impeccably elegant , restrained cinema . GARDE A VUE is confined almost exclusively to a drab police station , and mostly to one interrogation room , but director Claude Miller ( who made the wonderful film THIS SWEET SICKNESS , among others ) intercalates spare glimpses of exterior tableaux as minimalist locale scenography . Miller 's restraint , especially early on , is breathtaking , and his exquisite handling of the consequently-pivotal interior mise-en-scene makes for captivating viewing . Lino Ventura is superb as usual , succeeding to legitimize a character that , on paper , is cliche : the laconic , hard-nosed , world-weary homicide detective . Ventura lives the role , making it completely believable , even though the script allows us little access to his inner workings ; the film ends at the very moment it appears he will be forced to confront his failure for the first time . Michel Serrault is equal to the task as the suspected child-killer who shrewdly spars with the single-minded flic . The exchanges between the two are more often than not pregnant with tension and the aura of a constantly metamorphosing playing field for a battle of wits . Serrault 's character is by turns deplorably haughty and cunning , and pitiable ; then later .. The " message " of GARDE A VUE , if one were to search for one , is a condemnation of police methodology and the kind of pressures that make a cop over-zealous to , if necessary , close cases at the expense of justice . For most of its length though the film shines as nothing more than an exemplar of how to turn a potentially soporific set-bound scenario into a suspenseful drama of the utmost cinematic economy .  
0	  I don't give much credence to AIDS conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized . In the early years of the AIDS epidemic , the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies . This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi-monde of San Francisco . The city , renowned for its beauty , has rarely appeared uglier than in this film . A sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene . While the acting and plot can't be said to be well-done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss . Actually , I found the most interesting performance to be Irit Levi as a crusty and cynical Jewish , lesbian ( ? ) police detective . She 's interesting , though not necessarily convincing . Highlights : the film 's use of the garishly tragic Turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist , Ron Athey .  
1	  Very good drama although it appeared to have a few blank areas leaving the viewers to fill in the action for themselves . I can imagine life being this way for someone who can neither read nor write . This film simply smacked of the real world : the wife who is suddenly the sole supporter , the live-in relatives and their quarrels , the troubled child who gets knocked up and then , typically , drops out of school , a jackass husband who takes the nest egg and buys beer with it . 2 thumbs up .  
1	  I first saw Rob Roy twelve years ago . With little money for entertainment , I rented it for my fiancé and I to watch on a bone chilling winter 's night . The movie I had wanted was gone , so I rented this instead , not expecting much , and was very much surprised with how good it was . I just recently watched it again , and loved it every bit as much as the first time . For those unfamiliar with the story , it 's about Scottish outlaw Robert Roy MacGregor , a cattleman and folk hero . From the little I know about the man and his story , liberties have been taken with the facts , but it 's a movie , not a textbook , and so the filmmakers can be excused . Basically , the plot of the movie is that Rob Roy borrows money from the Marquis of Montrose to buy cattle which he then intends to sell and reap a large profit from . But , his plan is foiled when the friend entrusted with the money is robbed of the cash and murdered in the forest . Our hero finds himself on the run after failing to settle the matter with the Marquis , and Mary , his wife , suffers a sadistic rape at the hands of Archibald Cunningham , a smarmy Englishman with no soul . Atrocities ensue , until , in an immensely satisfying conclusion , Rob carves Archibald up like a Christmas turkey . There are many great performances in this movie , but allow me to touch specifically on a few . Liam Neeson , as usual , is fantastic , a sexy beast you can't take your eyes off of . Honestly , this man is like ice cream : even when he 's bad he 's good . His Rob Roy is an honourable man struggling to provide for those who depend on him , in the best way he knows how . Jessica Lange , as Mary , gives this woman a fierceness which is a nice change from the simpering , dull movie wives audiences are usually forced to endure . You just know she doesn't take any b . s from Rob , or anyone else for that matter . Tim Roth is completely over the top with his portrayal of the evil Archibald , yet somehow , it works . All the posturing and preening , combined with some wicked dialogue , result in one of the most memorable movie villains in recent memory . Combine all of this , and the stellar work by other supporting players , with the luscious scenery of Scotland , and you have what amounts to one really , really cool movie . If you haven't seen this , I highly recommend that you do .  
0	  I can't recommend this film as a date movie . Gary Oldman 's semi-autobiographical account of life lived on a South East London estate is a violent , Beckettian account of one of Dante 's circles of hell , frankly . At the centre of it is Ray Winstone , who has done this sort of character before but never as well . The film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar - that 's all - and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration , self-loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie . It 's an acting masterclass . Of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and Winstone is matched by Kathy Burke as his long-suffering wife , who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour . Charlie Creed-Miles does an able turn as the fuse-lighting druggie son Billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for . Gary Oldman directs close up on the actors , maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor . 4/10  
1	  The Unborn is a pretty good low-budget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy . It 's very well acted by the always-good Brooke Adams and b-movie stalwart James Karen , although the supporting cast is pretty average for a b-grader . The music , by Gary Numan of all people , is good too . Henry Dominic 's script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing , although there is a hint of misogyny about it . Rodman Fender 's direction is merely adequate , and there are some unnecessary cheap scares . If you 're a fan of Adams , whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be , check it out ; she 's great , as always .  
0	  I picked up this video after reading the text on the box , the story seemed good , and it had Keanu Reeves ! But after 5 minutes of watching , I noticed how horrible his acting was , he walks and talks so stupid the whole time , it 's fake and not convincing . It doesn't end there , almost ALL the characters act so badly it 's laughable , the only acceptable acting was by Alan Boyce ( David ) , but the guy commits suicide early on and you don't see him again , you never even know why he did it ! Everything about this movie screams low quality , I can't believe how such a thing gets released ! I was tempted many times to stop watching , in fact I did , half way through it I decided to stop watching and turned the thing off , came to the IMDB to check what other 's thought about it , I found zero comments ( not surprised ) , so I decided to force myself to handle the pain and go back to finish it then come here to comment on it . The only good thing going ( for me ) was the high-school Rock band theme , the occasional guitar playing and singing parts , but that 's not worth it . Very bad acting and directing .. Terrible movie .  
1	  Every scene was put together perfectly . This movie had a wonderful cast and crew . I mean , how can you have a bad movie with Robert Downey Jr. in it , none have and ever will exist . He has the ability to brighten up any movie with his amazing talent . This movie was perfect ! I saw this movie sitting all alone on a movie shelf in " Blockbuster " and like it was calling out to me , I couldn't resist picking it up and bringing it home with me . You can call me a sappy romantic , but this movie just touched my heart , not to mention made me laugh with pleasure at the same time . Even though it made me cry , I admit , at the end , the whole movie just brightened up my outlook on life thereafter . I suggested to my horror , action , and pure humor movie buff of a brother , who absolutely adored this movie . This is a movie with a good sense of feeling . It could make you laugh out loud , touch your heart , make you fall in love , and enjoy your life . Every time you purposefully walk past this movie , just be aware that you are consciously making the choice to live and feel this inspiring movie . Who knows ? What if it could really happen to you ? , and keep your mind open to the mystical wonders of life .  
1	  I have seen this film several times , and watched it today ( on TCM ) solely because of Geraldine Fitzgerald . She is a much underrated actress and I have to admit I have had a crush on her since I first saw her ( probably in " Wuthering Heights " 40 or more years ago ) . The real star in this movie , however , is Paul Lukas , and he deserved all the accolades he got . He makes it clear , whether we like it or not , that the end justifies the means . Naziism had to be stopped , and anything that helped do it was good . He gave his children a line about being bad , and that they should not be bad , but as he said earlier when conversing with adults , he would do this sort of thing again without hesitation . Lukas did give an excellent portrayal of a man caught in this situation , and made it clear that what he did was a very hard thing to do . Some people think his victim was a Nazi , but I don't think so - I think he was only after the money . His Nazi associates knew this and that is why they did not have much use for him . One interesting point in the film , and presumably also in the play , is the fact that Muller ( Lucas ) is a German . While the anti German hysteria of WWI was not repeated in WWII , there was considerable anti-German sentiment and some Germans were interred similar to what happened in California with people of Japanese ancestry . It was something of an act of bravery for Hellman to write a play about good Germans at this time ( maybe she thought they were the ones who signed the Nazi-Soviet pact ! ) . After all , the US and British air forces were bombing German cities and having no qualms about killing innocent civilians . I think , however , that the Dresden bombing and firestorm happened later , after " Watch on the Rhine " was released . The title is something of a play on words , as the " watch " is looking west , from Germany . In fact , Watch am Rhein was a German army marching song - used in WWII , but the Nazis had their own marching song that was used as well . But Muller IS a German and he is engaged in his own " Wach am Rhein " . All the other actors did an excellent job here ; although Bodo was too much there are children like him . I am surprised he did not give his father 's secret away . In real life , he may very well have done so .  
1	  Full marks for Pacino 's rendering of the speech over the dead kid 's coffin ; Shakespeare 's Mark Antony would be put to shame ! Was it Paul Schrader or was it Ken Lipper who should be complimented on the remarkable dialogues ? They are rich and intelligent and well worth your time if you like movies with good scripts . I found the story narrative developing quite well right up to the voice-over postscript . There is little else to talk about in this film ; even John Cusack has done better roles than this one . Interestingly , the film is very male oriented-the women are mere appendages .  
1	  * SPOILER ALERT * All throughout Australia the summer turned into a deluge of rain and hail stones the size of baseballs that was causing havoc in coastal cities like Sydney . It 's under these hectic conditions that tax lawyer David Burton , Richard Chamberlain , got involved in a case , as a defense attorney , involving the death of a local aborigine who was found dead outside a Sydney bar . Having five fellow aborigines arrested for Billy Cormans , Athol Compton , death it 's determined by the police coroner that Billy died of drowning not by violence even though he had bruises on his neck and shoulders . Yet the court decided to prosecute the five for his death charging them with manslaughter instead of murder . David defending the five gets no help from them in their defense with the accused assailants opting to remain quite and keep what happened to Billy to themselves and take what 's coming to them from the court . One of the defendants Chris , David Gulpili , begin to somehow invades David 's dreams as if he want 's to tell him what was really behind Billy 's death . David at first not taking his dreams of Chris seriously begins to sense that their real when he meet him at the courthouse . Chris confirms David 's dreams by showing him a strange looking black rock that David saw Chris have in his dreams . Later meeting Chris and , what turns out to be an aborigine shaman , Charlie ( Nandjiwarna Amagula ) who came to his house that evening David is told that he , like Charlie , has spiritual powers that he inherited from his mother 's grandfather . Those powers will reveal to him the future that has to do with the strange weather conditions that are flooding the Australian continent . The earth , Chris tells David , is going through a gigantic cleansing cycle with the old world about to be washed away and the new world ready to take it 's place . David is confused about what both Chris and Charlie are telling him but as the rains continue to increase and the ocean waves start to rise he feels that something terrible is going to happen . David want 's to know if it 's all aborigine folklore or there 's some scientific facts , or logic , behind their end of world-like revelations . By now it 's obvious that both Chris and Charlie are members of an aborigine tribe right in the heart of modern Sydney . That alone can get Chris off , as well as his four friends , for the murder of Billy . Since the Australian government will not prosecute tribal aborigines , leaving any justice to be done by the tribes themselves . Still Chris refuses to admit he 's a member of a native tribe and he and his four friends are convicted of manslaughter in Billy 's death with the sentences to be handed down by the judge within days . David now determined to find out what was the reason for Chris ' silence , and why Billy had to die , is taken by Chris to the scene of the crime . It 's there that David finds out that Billy betrayed Chris ' tribe members by going there with Billy not being a member of Chris 's aborigine tribe . It 's also revealed to David that he himself has some kind of spiritual connection with the Austrailan aborigines as both Charlie and his step-father Rev. Burton , David Parslow , told him . The stage is now set for the great and final cleansing cycle that David 's been seeing in both his night-time dreams and day-time visions . It comes in the form of a massive tidal wave rolling out of the Pacific Ocean into the Australian coast city of Sydney and then submerges the entire continent .  
0	  1st watched 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10 ( Dir-Arne Glimcher ) : Mystery ? / Thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists . Despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under-estimates it 's audience . The movie-going public is not stupid and I hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with . We think that this movie is going to be about something with Connery 's conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard , contrived for the audience 's sake , run of the mill , let 's never get it over with , thriller . We are pulled into every silly switch in character , as they are portrayed to us when it 's needed in the story , and we 're ready for this thing to be over way before it ends . Yes there is some good acting here , especially from Blair Underwood , Fishburne , and Ed Harris in a psycho-supporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very long-awaited end .  
1	  Why the crap is this movie rated so low ? ! I 've seen this movie over 25 times , I know EVERY line to this movie . It 's obvious that I love this movie . Trey Parker and Matt Stone ( creators of South Park and the new puppet masterpiece Team America ) star as the main characters Joe Cooper , or Coop " Airman " Cooper , and Doug Remer , or " Sir Swish . " Mainly they 're just referred to as Coop and Remer throughout the movie . Right as the movie starts it reminds us of the money hungry corrupt world of overpaid sports starts , they even go as far as to make one up called " Townsell . " I must quote this portion of the movie since it is true with some sports starts : " And after playing for New England , San Diego , Huston , Saint Louis , a year for the Toronto Arganauts , plus one season as a greater at the Desert Inn I 'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of Miami . " His agent leans over : " Minnesota . " Let us not forget this important piece of the movie . So it starts that Coop and Remer are at a high school reunion party and realize they are still nothing as they talk to their old classmates . Outside they create the sport BASEketball after being challenged by what probably was high school basketball heroes . After shaming them the sport goes pro in about a year . During this time they manage to recruit their third team mate Squeak , which is actually a day after they invent the game . As the movie follows we find out that Coop , Remer , and Squeak are the only virtuous sports heroes left . The story follows with zany blackmail , the Milwaukee Beers cheerleaders , and humor so absurd it 'll leave you crying for more . Watch it dude , it 's hilarious .  
0	  The banner says it all , this is one really bad movie , which is sad because I normally like Sheffer , and I have been impressed with Andrea Roth in other roles . This , however , is terrible . I wont waste any more time .. its just that bad .  
0	  Elephants Dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community . And while it was a very interesting idea in concept , in reality it has failed miserably . The film is beautifully rendered , which is probably the only redeeming factor . A huge problem with them , however , is the vast overruse of light bloom . It 's horrible , although I guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality . One thing to note is the terrible voice acting . While Proog 's voice actor is at least semi-competent , Emo 's voice actor is HORRIBLE . I guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero , you can't afford to hire real voice actors . To me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice . As a whole , the movie doesn't really go anywhere . To me it seems like it 's more of a " look what we can do " kind of movie instead of a real film . The plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point . The whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas . Overall , it may be worth a quick download from the official site , but don't expect anything except pretty graphics .  
0	  Rosie wasted a lot of TV time talking about the Tainos as if they were super influential in the dynamics of the modern day Puerto Rican . They were not . The truth is that the Africans and the Spanish were and she knows it . What kills me is that she is standing on the screen looking like some average light skin black chick ( with an obvious black daddy , cousins and auntie ) pretending to truly acknowledge the real essence of what makes them the modern day Puerto Ricans , but barely mentioned how Africans influenced the way their Spanish is spoken , the food and music . She is so typical and I lost a lot of respect for her and will not support anything else she does . Also , since she wants to dance around her African-ness then she need not take more roles associated with blackness ( i.e. Lackawanna Blues ) . We can find a prideful Black Latina next time ( thank you Zoe Saldana , Gina Torres , Gina Ravera and Melissa DeSousa ) . To the Puerto Rican on here that said they are African and not " black " .. thank you . We " blacks " certainly do not have anything in common with " you " so there is no love lost . But , since you are probably in the States and have benefited from the Civil Rights movement we would like for you refuse any decent human treatment you received courtesy of the blood , sweat and tears from the backs of the " blacks " you share nothing with . If I am correct Puerto Ricans have a terrible image in the media , but we blacks do not spend our time trying to disrespect you because we know that the media loves to exploits the low points and behaviors of all minorities to maintain mindless generalizations . However , you evidently have fed into the hype that one you are somehow white or superior .. you are not . Also , you somehow feel compelled to believe that black culture is BET .. again you are incorrect and need to take a vacation out of the hood . Try visiting Atlanta , Ga . , Houston , Texas , Charlotte , N.C. Trust me none of those blacks want to claim your " culture " either .  
1	  This is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses evoking a range of emotions . It contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy . You get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs . And , it ends very upbeat  
0	  Ridiculous fluff , that compounds its error by trying to have meaning . Joan , this time as a congresswoman , Agatha Reed , chairwoman of a committee dedicated to " investigating the high cost of food . " Says Congresswoman Reed , " The housewife has been getting it in the neck too long . I 'm going to keep fighting long enough so that the American family can take a vacation once a year , see a movie every week and feed an occasional peanut to an elephant . " She 's all business , but becomes all gushy when she is awarded an honorary degree from Good Hope College , where she was expelled for the crime of having stayed out all night ( the parallel to Joan 's real life is unmistakable here , as it is in all Joan Movies ) . The degree causes much consternation on campus ( " That would make it the most broad-minded institution in the history of education ! " )  but Joan is unaware of this as she arrives . The college president , Jim Merrill , played by Robert Young , at his handsomest , happens to be Joan 's former teacher  and lover . It was with * him * that she spent the night out , all those years ago , but Joan felt it was better to just disappear rather than try and explain to the skeptical college that they were about to be married . Naturally , this high-profile event will be covered by * Life * magazine  and who does the photographer turn out to be ? Yet another of Joan 's old lovers  this one , she hung out with in China " during the war " , and he thinks Joan might be headed for trouble with her old flame . Eve Arden , playing Joan 's assistant , " Woodie , " is at her butchest and most smart-alecky in this movie  with her flippant and unnecessary remarks that would make you dismiss her from her job , if you didn't like her so much . But you not only like Eve in this , as in all her roles , you adore her . She is so droll and no-nonsense , you 'd like to pay her just to hang around and be one of the boys . When Joan cries upon arriving at her alma mater , Eve tells her it " looks fierce . " But Joan says that maybe others only see a collection of buildings , she , Joan , sees youth  herself at 18 " eager , expectant  a little frightened , asking ' What is life ? What am I ? ' " But , of course , if we actually go into depth about Joan at 18 , the truth may be a little different . For me , this is the major problem in watching any Joan movie . You can call her characters whatever you want to , but it 's always all Joan , all the time . So , since what we 're always seeing is Joan being herself , it 's easy to dispense with character 's names . It 's just that it gets confusing when Joan tries to tell us something patently untrue , like her description of herself at 18  when we know that at 18 , Joan had already been around the block several times . Many men would have described her as eager , and as far as being expectant , she had already had several abortions at this point . But that 's a personal problem , and I digress , but I simply wanted to explain why I say things such as " and then Joan does " this or that , or " We see Joan as .. " when we are not literally watching a home movie . There is an unintentionally hilarious moment in which Joan is given the Clara Bow doll that she left behind in college  quick arithmetic tells us that Joan and Clara were contemporaries and this is a transparent ploy to make us believe Joan is much younger than she actually looks . It fails . What also fails is an attempt at early-50s political correctness . In the story , Joan has written a book about free speech and made a film ( no , not the one about the plumber ) , and she attracts the attention of an early 50s campus radical , Dr. Pitt , who is about to be fired for his views , which are shockingly similar to Joan 's . This is where the movie mysteriously becomes a morality tale a weak one , to be sure , but perhaps the only thing that keeps it from sliding into oblivion .  
0	  In one word .. abysmal . I give it one star for the hippie sex scenes and eye candy women , otherwise forget it . Corman 's worst effort , bar none . Ben Vereen should have had his name permanently stricken from the cast . I cannot believe that this is now going to be on DVD ( as of 2/15/05 ) with " Wild In The Streets " - another retro stinker . I woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold , decided to watch a movie to cheer me up some , scanned the digital channels .. the premise looked interesting enough because I like viewing B-movie sci-fi , hippie culture and rebellious teen flicks . It seemed familiar somehow and with Ben Vereen in the cast , I thought .. why not ? What a big mistake .. it was a horrible start to my day . Only after viewing it , I now know why the familiarity crept into the recesses of my newly-awakened brain . I remembered seeing coming attractions for this film as a 14-year old ( I 'm 45 ) , back in the early / mid-seventies at the Sombrero , a local art theater that no longer exists .. the whole theater laughed hysterically and even groaned out loud at how bad this movie looked . Acting : dreadful , story : awful , cinematography : nearly-awful , music : terrible , sound : horrendous , directing : a joke . If you choose to watch this after my warning , remember .. " I told you so . " " Gass s s s " is the perfect title for this film .. you feel " gassed " after viewing this putrid movie - or maybe that you should be taken to a " gas " chamber for wasting your brain away . I have seen homemade Super 8 movies that put this film to shame . Definitely a new addition to my all-time Top Ten WORST films .. it 's up there ( er , down there ) with " Tentacles . " Ted in Gilbert , AZ  
0	  This film was rather a disappointment . After the very slow , very intense ( and quite gory ) beginning the film begins to lose it . Too much plot leaves too little time for explanation , and coming out of the theater I wondered what this was all about . The characters remain shallow , the story is not convincing at all , most of it is déja vù stuff without hints of parody , and there are some very cheesy parts .. Like , the young cop has to do dig up a body . Of course it 's night AND it rains AND he has to do it alone .. yawn ! Or The Manifestation of the Evil being " nazis " plus " genetic manipulation " .. Wow , that 's really original . There are some nice bits , though , like the fistfight scene , mountain views and some ( running ) gags , but ( though Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can ) that 's definitely not worth it . ( 3 out of 10 )  
0	  I found the characters mediocre and the story uninteresting . I never had to read this book ( thankfully ) , or it would have been a painful experience . I got the tickets to the preview for free but it still wasn't worth my time , or my friend 's . I think this story is not worth telling . It 's like saying that old people have a past before they got old ( no kidding ) . The lives of the main characters were painful to watch , one generation no better than the next at avoiding stupid mistakes . However , I think the actors did the best they could with a lame story . I 've always been a big fan of Ellen Burstyn . I 'm writing this review to counteract the positive reviews given , which unfortunately convinced me to give this movie a try .  
0	  Not funny - how can anyone link this to Monty Python ? That is absolutely ridiculous - there are no laughs . This is not funny . Over the top , but ugly , weird just for weird sake and it seems to me these people were on something all the time . Unfortunately something that did not make them funny . It should be given some points for effort etc . whatever . Actually it appears there is a laugh track - or is there one ? Humm .. Since there are barely any laughs that 's a debatable question . Maybe I 'm doing it injustice - maybe it 's some sort of exercise . Some sort of art - in that case anything goes , never mind . But these guys playing women with high-pitched voices , turned-up noses . Come on ! Not funny . There is only one heir apparent to Monty Pythons intellectual wit and that is Stephen Colbert , and maybe Jon Stewart .  
0	  I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine . It wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic . The storyline is different and I am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands . Directing and acting were awful ! I had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs . Although the movie started promisingly , it got worse and worse . I think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters .. I still think that it is worth watching as I haven't seen films subjecting gay porn . Don't keep your expectations high though , then you will be very disappointed . * out of *  
1	  xica da Silva is one of the best Brazilians opera soap ever ! the a black slave 's story that becomes queen of a small villa when conquering the most powerful man 's of the area love , in the colonial period of the brazil dominated by Portugal , that explored its diamonds . The largest xica enemy , violante , bride that it was changed by xica , is a woman of big it influences the Portugal king close to and does to take revenge of the slave of everything . Very religious person , she is a picture of the hypocritical society and religious of the time , she dedicates its life the morality of the villa that was committed by xica , that is a woman full of lusts that it faces the society of the time to preach and it helps the slaves of the area . The story also bill with forbidden loves , sorceries and vampires and religious fervor . Xica da Silva does with that you don't want to lose a I only surrender , from beginning to end !  
0	  The script for " Scary Movie 2 " just wasn't ready to go . This is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident , to the actors and the audience alike . Director Keenan Ivory Wayans , and many of the actors are funny people ; and so the movie isn't completely humorless . To their credit , the film has several funny moments . But as a whole , " Scary Movie 2 " is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original . The first " Scary Movie " was a laugh a minute film . It turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold . The humor in " Scary Movie 2 " is as heavy handed as it is un-original . They even miss obvious opportunities for parody . Two of the movies stars are former cast members of " Beverly Hills 90210 , " and this was a show that was begging to be parodied ! In the final analysis , " Scary Movie 2 " is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon . The script needed a lot more time to age . 2 stars out of 5 .  
1	  A great gangster film . Sam Mendes has directed this beautiful movie showing another father-son camaraderie . Brilliant star-cast leading with Tom Hanks ( Michael Sullivan ) has done a terrific job . Great acting by him again . He is an acting legend . Great acting too from Paul Newman , Jude Law and Daniel Craig . Casting is just too good . The plot is quite good . You will enjoy the movie . A great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930 's . Set in the 1930 's , this will surely stand out as the zenith of all gangster movies of that era . Soundtrack is pretty good an apt to the movie . A great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son . Way underrated for my liking . Deserved a fully deserved 10 .  
1	  Sabrina the Teenage Witch was one of my favorite T.V shows of life :D i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school . So far i think i 've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times . Melissa Joan Hart plays the perfect teenage girl / witch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to . She 's funny , smart , outgoing , witty , and a lot more . Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit the part very well as Sabrina 's aunts . Zelda , the intelligent scientist , and Hilda the crazy , wacky one make a perfect balance in Sabrina 's life . Though i must agree that the college years aren't as good as her high school years , but that doesn't mean they weren't still good . I think the ending was awesome although it was not what i hoped , it made sense and i loved it anyways . :)  
1	  Reese Witherspoon 's first movie . Loved it . The plot and the acting was top notch . You are emotionally involved with the characters . In my opinion , a must see . After watching this movie you will see why Reese Witherspoon 's acting career has been so successful . The other cast members do a great job also . The movie flows extremely well . There is not a boring moment in the whole picture . The Man in the Moon 's length is just right . As I said earlier , I think this movie was excellent . I have seen it numerous times , and have enjoyed every one of the viewings .  
1	  This horror movie , based on the novel of the same name , suffers from flawed production and choppy , amateurish direction , but it 's nonetheless strangely compelling . Unlike shocker horror flicks such as The Exorcist , this movie takes the viewer on a slow yet relentless dip into a pool of evil . It drifts into horror , which dawns on the audience with the same dreamlike slowness as it dawns on the poor girl who 's been unwittingly chosen to be the next sentinel . Her appointed task is to sit at the gates of hell and prevent evil from erupting into the world . This falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her life . The story is true to the book , which was riveting , but the way it 's edited can lose the viewer . There are subtleties in the plot that are shaved away and never explained satisfactorily , which hurts this film . That 's a pity . The Sentinel is not an edge of your seat kind of flick ; it 's more a watch-and-squirm uncomfortably . Like a bad car wreck , there 's a compulsion to look even when it becomes unbearable . This movie isn't all bad , and still has a capacity to shock . The cast was competent . Christina Raines was captivating as Alison , the vulnerable girl under spiritual attack from both sides , a pawn in the never-ending battle between good and evil . Chris Sarandon was good as her caring but ultimately self-centered boyfriend . Eli Wallach and a very young Christopher Walken are the detectives struggling to unravel the bizarre puzzle they 've been handed . Ava Gardner is elegant as the realtor unaware of the horrors lurking in her rental property . The gaunt elderly John Carradine , with his arthritis-twisted hands , is excellent as the dying sentinel who must be replaced . The devil is played to charming perfection by Burgess Meredith ; he 's so sweet and yet so evil . There are future stars hidden in this film : Beverly D'Angelo and Jeff Goldblum as friends of the poor girl , and Jerry Orbach playing successfully against type as a jerky television director . The damned souls at the end are portrayed by actual sideshow freaks and geeks . Whoever thought to do that was a twisted but brilliant genius . The horror that pervades the movie bubbles up unexpectedly , such as when Alison opens a door and finds something that evokes a flashback to when she found her father with his two whores . She relives her first suicide attempt , faces a pair of strangely dysfunctional lesbians , and sees a cat cut up as a cake . Time and again , she 's yanked back and forth through reality and fantasy , through dreams and waking nightmares , all the while lacking the means to cope . In truth , the devil is trying to drive her insane enough to kill herself before becoming the next sentinel . Will he succeed .. ? In summary , slow-moving yet indescribably creepy , well-acted but poorly directed , and a very typical 70 's horror film before the real shockers cut loose . ( No pun intended ) This movie may not work for those with a short attention span , but it can still send chills up the spine , and still can provide some low-key shock value . It remains a strangely compelling and entertaining dip into the realm of evil .  
0	  I shudder to think what people must have thought of environmentalists after viewing this piece of overbearing , preachy cinematic trash . Larded with enough Indian-wannabe nuttery and space brother buffoonery to stock a new-age shop , Starlight makes anyone who gives a damn about the planet look like a feather-wearing crystal-fondling idiot . The plot ? Alien Rae Dawn Chong arrives to guide a flute playing underwear model in a mystical quest to avert Earth 's impending environmental collapse . But first they must defeat an evil alien who looks nothing so much like a refugee from a Castro street bar . Fortunately , they 've got mystical grandpa Willie Nelson along to help ( who looks faintly embarrassed by the proceedings , as well he ought to be ) along with buckets of cheap F / X and reams of pointlessly swelling music . Sure , the clunky script helps to obscure the film 's trite plot and staggering pace , but that 's just the tip of this melting movie iceberg . Everyone concerned with this film should have their union cards revoked until they complete a real course in environmental science .  
1	  A DAMN GOOD MOVIE ! One that is seriously underrated . The songs that the children sing in the movie gave me a sense of their pain , but also their hope for the future . Whoopi Goldberg puts in a good performance here , but the best performance throughout the whole movie is that of the actress who plays the title character . I wish she was in more movies . This movie should have a higher rating . I give it a 10/10 .  
1	  I saw this movie in the theater , and was thoroughly impressed by it . Then again , that was when Claire Danes was a good actress , not the foolish , arrogant , Hollywood-ized bitch she is today . Anyway , this film really struck me as one of the more raw , realistic , beautiful friendship films . How far would you really go for your best friend ? I was moved to tears at the end , and still tear up when I watch it now ( I own it ) . I remember as soon as I left the theater , I called my best friend and sobbed to her how much I loved her . This is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend . However be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you 'd do something like that for her ..  
1	  I 've read one comment which labeled this film " trash " and " a waste of time . " I think this person got their political undies tugged a bit too much . I just rented the new Criterion DVD 's of both Yellow and Blue . These films-although hardly great-have at least become of historical interest as to the so-called " radical student political-social movement " of the late ' 60s . I hadn't seen either picture and from their notorious reputation , I was expecting some real porn ( there isn't any . ) There is frontal nudity ( including the still verboten frontal male nudity ( automatic NC-17-the Orwellian-X ) in the U.S. But I wasn't expecting the films in-your-face democratic socialist message . Though it tends to the simplistic , I thought it occassionally made its points well . Both films occassionally had me laughing out loud and the director 's commentary made it clear there was plenty of parody in the film . Especially the supposedly " pornographic " sex scenes . The first such scene is very realistic . The lead couple is clumsy , inept , funny and endearing in their first copulation scene . The second-which caused the most complaints-has faked cunnilingus and fellatio . And the last is the end of an angry fight , that is believable . The extras include an informative introduction to the film , an interview with the original American distributor and his attorney , excerpts from trial testimony in the U.S. and a " diary " commentary by the director on some scenes . This is the film that " blue noses " wouldn't let alone and led to the pivotal " prurient interest with no social redeeming value " standard that , thankfully , still stands . Those with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a must see .  
1	  When you typically watch a short film your always afraid that the person creating the film tries to throw too much into it . That 's not the case with this one . A great story about a young girl who 's had enough and other worldly forces trying to help make things right . Eric Etebari does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helps to convey the complexities of the blurred line of right and wrong . Both the young girl and the father give great performances in this wonderful short film , but Eric 's performance is definitely the show stealer in this story . I definitely recommend this film for it 's complexity , performance , and great over all story .  
1	  Bogdonovich 's ( mostly ) unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other . A film that has the feel of a fairy tale , but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic Manhattan locations and " true " geography , perhaps the best location filming in NYC I 've ever seen . John Ritter reminds us that with good directors ( Bogdanovich , Blake Edwards , Billy Bob ) he can be brilliant , and the entire ensemble is a group you 'll wish truly existed so you could spend time with ` em . One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesn't seem to be a rip-off of something else , this is the high point of Bogdanovich 's fertile after - " success " career , when his best work was truly done ( " saint jack " , " at long last .. " , " noises off " .  
1	  I rented this film because of my interest in American history , and especially the somewhat weird story of the Mormons . This movie attempts to make some sense out of how Joseph Smith could turn his " vision " into a major world religion . It first focuses on the troubles the Mormons had in their settlement at Navuoo , Illinois . It portrays the trial of Joseph Smith . Within the course of that trial , Brigham Young stands up to tell of his conversion to Mormonism , and of his belief in the spiritual message of Smith . Then Smith is assassinated , and Young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the Mormons to a new land . Despite his grave doubts , he perseveres , and finally has a vision ( that Utah is the place for his colony ) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership . Later , as crops are destroyed by crickets , he again doubts that he has truly been chosen-however , a miracle occurs , which cements his place in history . I found the performances to be moving , and the story to be convincing and interesting . I would love to know whether Mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal . Polygamy is a part of the story , but the reasons why this is central to LDS are not raised . The issue is not emphasized . I 'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter , but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout .  
0	  I watched this movie for a project on love . please tell Nicolas Cage to learn what it would feel like to be his character , and then re-read the lines he 's saying . My life cannot go on .. i accidentally cut off my own hand .. my brother was close by . Obviously his fault . And since when have happy endings included the nice guy who takes care of Mom sad and alone . No closure , bad script , and doesn't have enough extension of minor characters . Save yourself , unless your up for a good laugh . Costumes were done appropriately , and extras did a fabulous job . I 'm sure it would have been a fun movie to make , but keep it more genre specific , I can't recommend this movie to anyone I know , because it is not an intellectual movie . It is not a chick flick . It is not a strict romantic . And I can't show kids because of the sex and questions to follow . All in all , just not a good flick .  
1	  to communicate in film essential things of life - like what is life , does it have a meaning ? - is sheer impossible . Of course possible answers to these questions are demonstrated in every film ( story ) , but communication needs a direct appeal to consciousness . This happens if the input from the senses overrules the " input " from our mind , i.e. our thoughts . Few directors know how to communicate essential things . Tarkovsky , is one . His " Stalker " shows images of existence , communicates life as it shows itself and yet escapes your mind . I think De Zee and De Graaff do the same .  
1	  Filmed just after the war , this story was made in order to highlight Anglo-American relations after the war . It ended up receiving the honour of being the first Royal Premiere after WWII . Remarkably the film tangles together the Royal Air Force , Sigmund Freud Psychology , the Founding fathers of America and various others up the long stairs ( special effects in its infancy ) and beyond the heavenly gates without losing any of its integrity . Although sounding absurd , this clever script leads and dances the viewer between heaven and earth with the skill of a mountain goat and a presents a charming ease rarely matched in cinema since . Be prepared to have your heart warmed by this sweet , innocent and charming love story . Roger Livesey acts like a man possessed to steal the show ! British Cinema should cry when it remembers how good it used to be in those early post war years .  
0	  The movie starts with a pair of campers , a man and a woman presumably together , hiking alone in the vast wilderness . Sure enough the man hears something and it pangs him so much he goes to investigate it . Our killer greets him with a stab to the stomach . He then chases the girl and slashes her throat . The camera during the opening scene is from the point of view as the killer . We next meet our four main characters , two couples , one in which is on the rocks . The men joke about how the woman would never be able to handle camping alone at a double date , sparking the token blonde 's ambition to leave a week early . Unexpectedly , the men leave the same day and their car breaks down .. They end up arriving in the evening . When the men arrive , they are warned about people disappearing in the forest by a crazy Ralph doppleganger . They ignore the warning and venture into the blackening night and an eighties song plays in the background with lyrics about being murdered in the dark forest . The men get lost . In the next scene we realize that this isn't just another The Burning clone , but a ghost story ! The women , scared and lonely are huddling together by the fire . Two children appear in the shadows and decide to play peeping Tom . Well they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo ! Their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they 've seen her children , before disappearing of course . The children run home to papa and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river . This causes quite a stir and he gets up , grabbing his knife from atop the fireplace . " Daddy 's going hunting , " The little girl , exclaims with bad acting . It is apparent here , that the dad isn't a ghost like his children . Freaked out by something in the woods , the token blonde splits , running blindly into the night , carrying a knife . She encounters the father who explains he 's starving and it will be quick . This doesn't make sense because of the panther growls we heard earlier ( Maybe he 's allergic ! Are panthers honestly even in California ? ) She ends up wounding him slightly before getting stabbed in the head . A thunderstorm erupts and the men seek shelter , which turns out to be where papa resides . Clearly someone lives here because there 's a fire and something weird is roasting over it . The children appear and warn them of papa , who shows up moments later . They disappear as soon as he arrives . For whatever reason , our killer only goes after females . He invites the men to have something to eat and tells us the story about his ex wife . We are given a flashback of his wife getting caught cheating . The old man doesn't tell them however that he kills her and her lover afterwards , but daydreams about it . We aren't given the reason for the children 's demise . The men go to sleep and are left unharmed . The next morning the men discover the empty campground of their wives . After a brief discussion they split up . One is to stay at the campsite , while the other goes and gets help . The one that is going back to his car breaks his leg . We are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from being sad about their mother . They agree to help the woman reunite with her friends The following scene defies the logic of the movie when papa kills the guy waiting at the campsite . He was also dating or married to the blonde . Somehow the children realize he is murdered and tell the woman about it . She decides to see it for herself and obviously runs into the killer . Luckily the children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever . You know where this is going . Overall the movie deserves four stars out of ten , and that 's being generous . For all its misgivings , the musical score is well done . It 's still watchable too . There are some camera angles that look professional , and some of the sets are done well . The plot is unbelievable . There is such a thing as willing suspension of disbelief , but with the toad 6 miles away ; I can't imagine the token blonde would take off like that in the middle of the night . I mean , come on ! - Alan " Skip " Bannacheck  
1	  Good times working with the Quiroz Brothers , and the entire cast on this project as the " Guy on the Bench . " I was amazed how well they accomplished capturing all the identifiable traits of a true " B " horror film . Hopefully I will have the opportunity to work with Pumpkin Patch Pictures team again in the future . I moved to Detroit shortly after completion and have been recognized in public on several occasions since the release . One time was actually in the video store and the girl damn near lost her mind . It was pretty funny and that was my 1st real autograph moment as I signed her receipt . One day I asked the girl at Blockbuster if the movie is rented often , and she confirmed by looking it up in the computer . At the time it was renting more than Ring2 which was also a new release at the time .. The title really captures immediate interest in the more urban markets . She also noticed on many occasions the movie had not been returned by the customer leading me to believe the movie is just so good people don't want to give it back .. Watch out for ZoMbIeS when in the hood cause they will get ya ! Jaysun Barr ( Guy on the Bench-2005 )  
1	  " Xizao " , is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions , and its effects on a family in China . Da Ming ( Quanxiu Pu ) , is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother Er Ming ( Wu Jiang ) makes him believe that his father Liu ( Xu Zhu ) , has died . He founds that his father is still alive , as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business , the public bathroom . The movie centers around Da Ming 's family , and how he has to learn the importance of his father 's job , something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon . Also , the movie explores his relationship with Er Ming , who is mentally challenged , and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies , but also their souls . The two main themes of the movie , the family and the problems of progress , are incredibly well handled , and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make , both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of Chinese society and customs . The director , Yang Zhang , tells his tale in a simple way , letting the characters characters do the job . It is a very simple approach , but it fits the movie perfectly , and I highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good . Zhang has enormous potential , as he can tell a story without the aid of visual flare or camera tricks . The acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach , everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed . The three lead characters give remarkable performances , and Wu Jiang as Er Ming surely steals the show . Even when the movie could had sticked to a patronizing " old days were much better " message , instead it takes an attitude of equilibrium , like saying that progress is good , and we must move on , but we must not forget where we came from , and keep an equilibrium between modern life and the traditions of old . An awesome , and touching film . 8/10  
0	  I have to say as being a fan of the man who created Halloween / The Fog / Christine / The Thing - probably his best films . Then you got this POS . I can't logically think he put any effort at all into this like he did with Cigarette Burns . At least his son made a decent soundtrack . You have to look at this from the standpoint that it didn't seem like a movie . It looked as if someone else directed it for one thing . I won't believe Carpenter put any effort into this at all . I was just listening to his old school H2 / H3 / The Fog soundtrack and it was awesome , especially for the times . He was using a style that no one had and it worked so well for his films .  
0	  I ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on ebay with very high expectations . I think I paid about 50 $ for this movie . As an eternal fan of horror , from cheesy 80s American slashers to European zombie films , I told myself this was going to be great ! I can't tell you how wrong I was . First of all , I thought it was gonna be pretty much gorier than it actually is . After all I 've had heard about this film , I was almost scared to watch it . The murders are boring . The acting .. forget it , there 's no acting ! The story , even if we don't care , is incredibly bad . It seems they tried to get your attention with some weird sexual scenes and naked girls , but unfortunately in this case it doesn't help the movie . Why ? There 's no atmosphere , and this is the worst thing about this flick . It 's just bad film-making from point A to B. Though it 's extremely funny and amusing to watch with your friends and a lot of beers , don't make any effort to get your hands on it . There are so many movies in this world , don't waste your time watching Necro Files !  
0	  Some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork - to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death .. I personally think that this movie is a disgust , which should have never been released . This movie is repulsive , illogical and meaningless . Not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come . The appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them . Such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering .. " Kill Bill " would be another example but at least " Kill Bill " has its purpose , meaning , climax and resolution ..  
0	  Who was George C. Scott ? George C. Scott was a renowned actor . Practically any movie that he 's been in is the better off for it . Now ol ' George had absolutely NOTHING to do with this movie .. , but he once said something that describes said movie to a T. I don't recall his exact words , but he basically said that Great Writing can Save Bad Acting , But Great Acting CanNOT save Bad Writing . Never has this little observation been truer than in " The All New Adventures of Laurel & Hardy : For Love or Mummy " . The casting of the two leads was absolutely perfect . Bronson Pinchot ( Laurel ) and Gailard Sartain ( Hardy ) not only look the parts , but they do an exceptionally good job at mimicking the real deal ( mannerisms and all ) . This movie should stand as a lasting testament to their talents . That said , this movie falls flat on its face when it comes to ( you guessed it ) WRITING . Aside from the opening dialogue between Pinchot and Sartain ( which was very " in character " ) and a brief gag involving a taxi , this movie is an absolute chore to sit through . PROBLEM # 1 : Too much time and effort went into the plot . I don't want to know why the mummy wants to kidnap the pretty British lady . What I WANT is to see Stan and Ollie ( or at least , their stand-ins ) . Way too much screen time was devoted to explaining the plot or to the not-very-funny secondary characters that said plot revolved around . However , even if this movie had been all jokes , that would still leave us with .. .. PROBLEM # 2 : Most of the jokes are what I would call " watered-down " slapstick . What do I mean by " watered down " ? In slapstick , a character gets hurt in an exaggerated way for comedic effect ( ala Looney Tunes , 3 Stooges .. , or how about Laurel & Hardy ? ) . In " watered-down " slapstick ( as I define it ) , a character gets mildly hurt or inconvenienced , and the filmmakers play that up for comedic effect . Maybe an illustration would help : In Looney Tunes , Daffy Duck gets shot by Elmer Fudd . His bill falls off and he puts it back on . That is classic slapstick . In this " gem " , Ollie accidentally bumps into some people . They turn around , tell him to be careful , and continue on their merry way . That 's not slapstick . That 's not even funny . That 's just .. boring .. and this movie is full of these kinds of jokes . It 's as though they 're this movie 's bread and butter . The writers and directors just take these dull moments and act like they 're supposed to be funny . Granted , the example I just gave is the most extreme case , but I can only cut it so much slack . Long story short : The film just doesn't work because the script fails to capitalize on Pinchot 's and Sartain 's abilities to impersonate Stan and Ollie . Instead , the script capitalizes on plot exposition and lame jokes . Watching this movie is basically watching two excellent impersonators who were given no real material to work with . Not a good movie , but an incredible sleeping aid . I say give this one a miss and stick with the real deal ( just so long as you steer clear of " Atoll K " and " Be Big " ) .  
1	  This is an entertaining look at the Gospel as presented by Johnny Cash ( adorned in black , of course ) who sings a lot and narrates a bit also . If you like Johnny Cash , this film is quite enjoyable . Also note the blonde depiction of Jesus in this work .. just for fun , try to think of five Jewish men who have blonde hair .. ? Anyway , its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all .  
0	  Can A-Pix ever , ever , ever do anything right ? This movie was meant to be seen on TV in a letterbox format . Since A-Pix doesn't even believe in pan and scan , we see whole scenes where a shoulder on the left side of the screen talks to a shoulder on the right side . Of course , not that you are missing much . This movie is incredibly bad . It 's very hard to enjoy a film where characters are screaming at the top of their lungs during 80 % of the movie for no reason .  
1	  This is a very entertaining film which follows the rehearsal process of a NY production of Macbeth . Although it has a lot to say about power , jealousy and ambition ( the themes of Macbeth ) in our modern world , the film works best when it is not taking itself too seriously . Recognizable actors such as John Glover , Gloria Reubens and David Lansbury do nice jobs in the main roles , but the highlight for me was the hilarious scene where the " murder " of Banquo ( John Elsen ) is rehearsed . Probably a more entertaining film for those involved in theatre , but anyone who enjoys Shakespeare should enjoy this film .  
1	  I love this movie . I mean the story may not be the best , but the dancing most certainly makes up for it . You get to know a little bit about each character the way THEY want you to learn about them . I just think that you won't like this movie unless you 're into Broadway ..  
0	  This is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for Fellini . About the only one more bizarre is his SATYRICON . This is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence , opulence and sexual challenge . Sutherland makes a curiously unappealing Casanova and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover 's autobiography fail to engage the viewer . The art direction and costume design are however OUTSTANDING . The Academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an OSCAR for the latter . Also nominated ( oddly ) was the disjointed , pointless and almost inacessible screenplay . Go figure ! The film on video is only 150 minutes , 16 minutes short of the original running time . This viewer was grateful .  
1	  Horror omnibus films were popular in the seventies . I 'm not very fond of them myself , but this one is an undeniably excellent slice of British horror cinema . The House That Dripped Blood is a horror omnibus , featuring four stories that surround a creepy old house in the country and are being told to a Scotland Yard officer by an estate agent . This film is headlined by three well known stars of horror cinema ; Peter Cushing , Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt , whom horror fans will recognise as one of Lee 's co-stars in the greatest British horror film of all time ; The Wicker Man . The first segment of the film , titled " Method For Murder " tells the story of a horror storywriter , whose creation ; a strangler named " Dominic " is brought to life by his own imagination . This story builds suspense very well ; through his girlfriend , he , and the audience is lead to believe that what he is seeing is a figment of his imagination . This story certainly isn't very original , but it makes up for its lack of originality through the atmosphere it creates and it 's final twist ; which works incredibly well and came as a genuine surprise . The second story , titled " Waxworks " , stars Peter Cushing and is my least favourite of the four . This tale follows the story of Phillip Grayson ( Cushing ) , a man that discovers a wax museum and decides to venture in . Inside , he discovers a woman that is familiar to him and who we later find out is a murderess . Quite what the woman 's relationship with Phillip entailed is never really explained , but the tale relies more on the mystery to build the suspense rather than plot details . Cushing is later joined by his friend , Neville Rogers ( played by Joss Ackland ) and that 's when the tale really starts to pick up . The setting of a waxwork museum full of murderers for a horror film isn't a new idea ; the same setting was used to great effect in the excellent 1966 horror film , " Chamber of Horrors " . Although the one here isn't as grand as the one in the aforementioned film , the power of the setting is used to no lesser a horrifying effect , much of which is achieved by a feeling of claustrophobia , brought about by the limited area of the museum . Peter Cushing is always interesting to watch , and seeing him avoid an axe-wielding madman is a treat for the horror fan . Despite being my least favourite , this story is still entertaining and interesting enough to not let this anthology down . The film continues with " Sweets for the Sweet " , which is without doubt the best of the omnibus . This story stars the legendary Christopher Lee as a seemingly overprotective father . The beauty of this story comes from the way it is played out . It leaves the audience guessing ; we know that there is something wrong with either the father or the daughter , but we don't know who , or what , it is . Christopher Lee , as usual , portrays his character with a great degree of sinisterness ; the audience is left to simmer over his actions regarding giving his daughter a doll , and the fact that she isn't allowed to go to school or have any toys . The card of exactly why is held close to the chest until right near the end , epitomised by the truly chilling line in which Lee tells his babysitter that he is , in fact , afraid of his daughter . The ending to this section is superbly played out , in my opinion it 's one of the finest endings to any horror story ever told , and will stay with you long after the end credits roll . The omnibus finishes with " The Cloak " , which is definitely the most comedic of the four . This tale is about a hammy horror film star that , unimpressed by his latest film 's technical side , goes out and buys himself a cloak . Naturally , this cloak turns out to be a real vampire cloak . Unlike the other three tales , this one seems to be played out mostly for laughs . That is no bad thing however as the majority of the humour is funny and it serves as a nice contrast to the rest of the film . The ending to this tale coincides nicely with the ending to the wraparound story of the film , which is a very sinister yet humorous ending to a very good film . Also , look out for the little jibe regarding Christopher Lee in Dracula . A nice touch , I think . Overall , if you want a horror omnibus , you really cant go wrong with The House that Dripped Blood . The third tale alone makes the film worthy of your time and this is a very solid horror film indeed .  
1	  The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film . I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me . Because Alan Dobie was a friend of mine , I got to hear about it . I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor . I asked Peter Collinson , through my agent , whether he might like me to do another draft . I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it . I was told , too late . So I did the only thing I could do under the circumstances and took my name off . I had no idea what they might have done to my screenplay . Then I was invited to see the finished film . I was so impressed that I very quickly asked to have my name put back on . It 's a beautifully made piece , from a hurriedly written first draft , I expected to be asked to do much more work on it ; perhaps if I had it wouldn't be so good . I would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is ? I would also love to see the film again , I only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in Soho .  
0	  I try to be very objective when I view a low budget movie . I also apply a lower weight to independent and low budget productions versus the big budget productions . I expect near flawlessness from big budget productions and their studios . Therefore I apply tougher criteria to the major studio releases . But this movie was just a dud . Period . The premise was terrible . The main character , Mary Gordano ( Alicia Silverstone ) , was unbelievable as a high school senior with an unquenchable desire to solve crimes . There was not enough depth in her character or her acting that pulled you into her world . Also , to make this movie more mysterious , the lighting in certain scenes did not set the mood , especially in the warehouse . Once again another disappointing movie that I could only give three points to .  
0	  As has been noted , this formula has been filmed several times , most recently as " You 've Got Mail " , with Tom Hanks and Meg " Trout Pout " Ryan . Of the several versions , this is my least favorite . The problem i think is that the studio coasted on the Stars charisma , which doesn't quite cut it here . The chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie . There are no real sparks . Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of day old donuts , pleasant but bland . And when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow . Judy in particular is disappointing . She looks like she has no neck ! I don't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it 's head into it 's shell , all hunched up and everything . I couldn't figure out what Van Johnson was getting so hot about . I would have made a bee line for that cute violin player . And Van wasn't great either . I 've always thought of him as a rather generic Hollywood leading man and he doesn't do anything to dispel that image here . If you 're a fan of the stars or the early 1900 's then you might like this movie . But there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there , and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale confection .  
1	  This is the best of Shelley Duvall 's high-quality " Faerie Tale Theatre " series . The ugly stepsisters are broadway-quality comedy relief , and Eve Arden is the personification of wicked stepmotherhood . Jennifer Beals does an excellent job as a straight Cinderella , especially in the garden scene with Matthew Broderick 's Prince Charming . Jean Stapleton plays the fairy godmother well , although I 'm not sure I liked the " southern lady " characterization with some of the lines . Steve Martin 's comedy relief as the Royal Orchestra Conductor is quintessential Martin , but a tiny bit misplaced in the show 's flow . As is customary with the series , there are several wry comments thrown in for the older children ( ages 15 and up ) . With a couple of small bumps , the show flows well , and they live happily ever after . Children up to age 8 will continue to watch it after the parents finally get tired of it - I found 3 times in one day to be a little too much .  
1	  well , i said it all in the summary , i simpley adore the movie and the cast .. i would give each actor an Oscar .. great , great movie .. i 'm 25 now and i watched it 4 times in different periods and i always think i won't cry and i always do , about 2 or 3 times .. ;) meryl s . was absolutely brilliant , jeremy irons also .. just brilliant .. i wish the movie received more awards .. i really don't know anybody who watched it and didn't loved it .. also , glenn close was fantastic .. the story was beautiful and sad at the same time .. i loved the fact that despite everything clara and esteban loved each other so much , and how blanca was close to her parents ..  
1	  Saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF . You may question some decisions of the maker - like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject - but this movie sure hits you in the gut . Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch . Hope it gets the distribution it deserves .  
1	  Lately I have been watching a lot of Tom Hanks films and old Chaplin films and even some of Rowan Atkinson 's early Bean performances , and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that permeates throughout their work , something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages , in a way that just makes you feel good . A Bug 's Life has that same charm , it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects , because even though they talk , they still ACT just like real bugs . It 's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them , to imagine bugs the way a young mind does . Honey , I Shrunk The Kids was one of my favorite films when I was younger , and to me , A Bug 's Life is like a more realistic version of that movie , if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story-telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities . I try not to compare it to something like Toy Story ( which I still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made ) , because the story of A Bug 's Life is not quite as good as Toy Story 's , but then again , almost nothing is . The important thing is that it is still wonderful fun . The story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an impressively developed society , mostly geared around building a harvest of food , most of which will go to the tyrannical grasshoppers , vastly superior in strength and general meanness , and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter . We are treated to some visits from the grasshoppers , who make it clear that if the bugs provide an unsatisfactory quantity of food , the consequences will be dire . And incidentally , the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to Mao Tse-tung 's vicious forcing of food from his own people during the " Great Leap Forward " The fun and excitement begins when Flik , the main character , sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the grasshoppers . You see , he spilled all of the amassed food and placed everyone in great danger , so he feels it 's his responsibility , but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of insect circus performers . Great for the audience , not so great for the safety of the clan . The movie was released back in the late 90s , when so many films seemed to have been coming out in twos , like Armageddon and Deep Impact , Independence Day and The Arrival , A Bug 's Life and Antz , etc . Comparisons between A Bug 's Life and Antz are inevitable , although it seems clear to me that A Bug 's Life is by far the superior film , and not only because it doesn't star Woody Allen stuttering and whining through the lead role . This is great family fun !  
1	  I was about thirteen when this movie came out on television . It is far superior in action than most movies since . Martin Sheen is excellent , and though Nick Nolte has a small part , he too provides excellent support . Vic Morrow as the villain is superb . When Sheen " tests the water " in his ' 34 Ford ( COOL ) along the mountainous highway it is spectacular ! The ending is grand . I 'm disappointed in the low vote this received . I figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days . Good taste eludes the masses !  
1	  Barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to . Just as simple as that , and he succeeded . Not only in his goal , but also in making a wonderful movie , especially visually . He knows how to use pans , slow-motion sequences , tracking shots , crane shots , etc . in a beautiful , smooth way . This gives the movie a very relaxing feel to it . The story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing : a party that they all attend to , which also is the turnpoint of this movie . The beauty of this picture lies not in the question how the characters have effect on eachother ( in comparance with a similar , of course better movie like Magnolia ) . I simply don't think that that was Barman 's idea . The beauty lies in the different details of experiences that people go through which makes or breaks their lives . Barman is very successful in telling those little stories that describe little experiences . He knows people .. and Antwerp . The soundtrack of the movie is also excellent , but not a surprise as we know that Barman is also a very succesful songwriter and musician with his band dEUS . The music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing which contributes to the sunny , smooth feel of the movie . Other times we hear funky pop / rock-melodies which give some scenes the strength that they need . There 's only one flaw , and that 's the last half an hour . Was it the runtime , which was breaking me up ? Or weren't the last scenes that fresh and accurate than the scenes until then ? I can't figure it out .. All in all a beautiful sunny movie which lifts the Belgian cinema up . 8 out of 10 ! ( It 's the breeze that flows through a girl 's hair on a sunny afternoon making her even more beautiful ; it 's the fresh breeze that makes you relax when it passes you at a crowded party when someone opens the door ; it 's the breeze that carries the perfume from that beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park who you just met a week ago ; it 's the breeze .. )  
0	  Today I found " They All Laughed " on VHS on sale in a rental . It was a really old and very used VHS , I had no information about this movie , but I liked the references listed on its cover : the names of Peter Bogdanovich , Audrey Hepburn , John Ritter and specially Dorothy Stratten attracted me , the price was very low and I decided to risk and buy it . I searched IMDb , and the User Rating of 6.0 was an excellent reference . I looked in " Mick Martin & Marsha Porter Video & DVD Guide 2003 " and  wow  four stars ! So , I decided that I could not waste more time and immediately see it . Indeed , I have just finished watching " They All Laughed " and I found it a very boring overrated movie . The characters are badly developed , and I spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story . The plot is supposed to be funny ( private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing ) , but I have not laughed along the whole story . The coincidences , in a huge city like New York , are ridiculous . Ben Gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man , with the women falling for him as if her were a Brad Pitt , Antonio Banderas or George Clooney , is quite ridiculous . In the end , the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the Playboy centerfold and playmate of the year Dorothy Stratten , murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie , and whose life was showed in " Star 80 " and " Death of a Centerfold : The Dorothy Stratten Story " ; the amazing beauty of the sexy Patti Hansen , the future Mrs. Keith Richards ; the always wonderful , even being fifty-two years old , Audrey Hepburn ; and the song " Amigo " , from Roberto Carlos . Although I do not like him , Roberto Carlos has been the most popular Brazilian singer since the end of the 60 's and is called by his fans as " The King " . I will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions ( manly Dorothy Stratten ) . My vote is four . Title ( Brazil ) : " Muito Riso e Muita Alegria " ( " Many Laughs and Lots of Happiness " )  
1	  Although I agree that it 's a good but not great movie , for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned , I still enjoy it . One reason is the music : I 'd call attention to the very cool appearance by the Candoli brothers - Conte and Pete - in a well-staged scene in the nightclub . These guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their day , and they manage to convincingly boggle the mind of Jimmy Stewart by playing an hysterical trumpet duet , one trumpet in each of Stewart 's ears . The Candolis really did play that well , too , though I suspect the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two of them . I don't know much about George Duning , who gets the credit for the music ( other than that he seems to have worked with the Three Stooges on more than one occasion ) , but the casting of the Candoli brothers as jazz-playing warlocks was a real nice touch .  
1	  Okay , this show is nothing but AWESOME ! It has a great story line and plot and great actors and actresses . Jeremy Sumpter is so hott and he is perfect for the role ! He is gunna be big in Hollywood . He has a bright future ahead ! This show better last a long time because I really love this show , and I hope that it has a lot of success ! It is so interesting . I have been waiting for it to come out for about 6 or 7 months and it 's finally here , and it 's great ! I tape it , too . I can watch it whenever I want now ! Too bad its only on once a week though . I wish it was on at least twice a week because now I wish that it was Tuesday every day ! Hope you all like this show ! ~ Ashley ~  
0	  Normally I 'm not motivated to write reviews . But this movie was so excruciatingly painful I feel I must . I cringed at the appallingly predictable plot , the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense . Indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the " most tense " moment of the movie . Molly Ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production . Even the " twist " at the end wasn't . I 've heard it said that the movie didn't take itself seriously ; but I could find little evidence of that in the movie . Cut should have been left on the cutting room floor . Do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else !  
0	  * Spoilers contained * I 'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific . What I didn't expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go . What starts off as a typical cowboy / indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic ' comedy ' about Honus ( Soldier Blue of the title played by Peter Strauss ) and Cresta ( Candice Bergen ) who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the Cheyenne . The majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit . Donald Pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason . They then escape and both turn up ( separately ) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the Cheyenne base . As Cresta used to be married to one of the Cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them . So far so ordinary . Then comes the ending . After enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they / won't they get together storyline , the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head . Similarities can be drawn with the Wild Bunch at this point of the film but the Wild Bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn't resort to extreme gratuitous violence . In some ways , Soldier Blue reminds me of Frank Perry 's Last Summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending . I didn't hate Soldier Blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending . If you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents , I would recommend Elem Klimov 's Come and See .  
1	  " Going Berserk " is actually one of the funniest Candy films I have ever seen , period . Sure , it 's kinda low budget , but it 's a non-stop comedic tour de force . There are tons of memorable quotes . For instance , when his soon-to-be father-in-law asks him how much he earns , Candy says " Oh , I pull down anywhere between thirty and .. eleven thousand dollars a year , sir . " Oh course , it is Candy 's delivery that sells it . Just classic stuff . Eugene Levy also turns in a hilarious performance as a sleazy filmmaker . A clip of his horrible low budget movie " Kung Fu U " will have you rolling . So if you are a Candy fan and want to rediscover a forgotten gem , I can't recommend this movie enough .  
1	  Thomas Capano was not Anne Marie 's boss Tom Carper , the Governor was . That is the reason the Feds became involved , he called Clinton and asked him to get the Feds involved in the case . I lived outside of Philadelphia at the time so the case was front page news every day . I also read Ann Rule 's book and saw the " City Confidential " segment on A & E. Tom Capano was a megalomanic ( sp . ) , an uber-controller and a monster . He claimed to love Ann Marie but all he wanted was someone that he could control . When she wouldn't let him do that anymore he killed her , the ultimate form of control . I think it 's a waste of money that he is still alive .  
0	  This movie was amusing at times , hell sometimes it was even downright funny . The underlying message I got from the film though , was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man . Every time a woman is depicted in the film , she is being lazy , being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason . I don't think the message involved is good for women or gay men . But , it is a comedy , and a piece of art , so it is simply someones point of view . Even if I don't agree with it , they are still entitled to it . An amusing film , but some of the comments others have made are just plain stupid . Best film ever my foot .  
0	  Tobe Hooper has made great movies so I was certain this couldn't be BAD . I didn't read any reviews and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous film . At times this made me laugh , sometimes I almost fell asleep , sometimes made me almost CRY for Hooper . I rated this 3/10 because its 1990 " horror " - movie and many interesting or funny things happened there . Throughout the movie I was thinking something like " they simply CAN'T add more things in this movie .. " .. but they did . Some tell this is some sort of Firestarter clone but truly isn't . It 's based on that idea but thats all . This is combination of horror , comedy , weird religion / god things , funny gore , simple effects , drama , horrible acting , unbelievable script .. and more . * spoilers * Story is : Government tries to create ultimate weapon using nuclear power or something and fails , during process child is born for 2 test persons . When mom sings to her child after the birth , both husband and wife burns and it is SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION . Government buries whole thing and leaves this child live amongst other people and .. then after x years this kid is grown up and realizes he has been born for a reason and whoa he can burn things with his brains . Then everything goes unbelievable messy nothing really explains anything and .. Well when The Government realizes " okay now he can set this fire thing to work " they take him to normal hospital where is some nuclear toxic what they are going to use on this man BECAUSE they could kill him , no they can't shoot him no ! .. and argh , I guess thats enough to tell , I promise there is 100 more weird things in this movie . Well if you want good laughs watch this one . Gosh .  
1	  In the sea of crap that Hollywood ( and others ) continue to put out , this is one of those diamonds in the rough . A small , simple movie that is very entertaining and leaves you with the feeling that you didn't just waste an hour and a half of your life . Ashley Judd is really quite amazing in this movie . I had never really been a fan or had noticed her before but going back and seeing this early performance of hers convinced me she 's extremely talented . Watching this film was an assignment in a college course for me so I was skeptical I would even care . I thought , " Oh boy , some dumb chic flick or feminist male-bashing indie crap .. " I was pleasantly surprised . Without analyzing the many relevant themes , I 'll just say , if you haven't seen it , do yourself a favor and check it out . Sometimes the down-to-earth , slice-of-life movies are the best , and this is a great one .  
1	  Gundam Wing to me happens to be a good anime . A bit slow moving ( especially around the middle of the series ) , but over all enjoyable . Now before anyone jumps on my case and calls me a " winger " , I will admit that I have watched all of the original Gundam , Gundam 0080 and 0083 , The 08th MS Team , and Gundam SEED . I will admit that there were a few problems with the story telling and a few characters may seem to be " rip-offs " ( i.e. Zechs Marquise to the original Gundam 's Char ) , but this is an alternate universe show based on the original series , as is SEED . If you wish to view this series make sure that you watch the original Gundam first , and then know that you are watching an AU series .  
1	  I 'm Italian and when I 've recently looked again this film I astonished for its beauty : the first time I was 10 years old and I liked it , but today I can appreciate it with adult mind and feelings . Now I can understand it was a masterpiece of a special season of the Italian cinema ( Pasolini etc . ) , by that time gone . The Hollywood epic films are good .. for fun . Perhaps this ' Odyssey ' had no English version because is not enough funny .. not suitable for pop-corn and coke audience . However suitable for Homer pathos and existentialist reflections . In Italy was recently released a very good DVD version : INTEGRAL , with excellent colors . You can find it in some file sharing , but it 's Italian only , and without subtitles . Too bad : also the dialogs and the voices of this film are remarkable .  
1	  A chance encounter between a salesman and a hit-man changes both their lives . This is an odd film that works , an impressive effort for writer-director Shepard . In a daringly unglamorous role that is a far cry from James Bond , Brosnan is surprisingly effective as the lonely hit-man who starts to buckle under the stress of his job , but is unable to connect emotionally with anyone to help him cope . Kinnear is equally good as the salesman , a decent fellow with a void in his life . Davis is fine as Kinnear 's flirtatious wife . Mainly a character study , the film is rewarding because it feels fresh and unpredictable , an extremely dark comedy .  
1	  I love this movie . It is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging . Congratulations ! I believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves . It is so eerie , you feel like you are watching a real life band . I would like to see more movies like this . I am glad that they did not choose famous Hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked . And even if Billy Connolly is quite well known , he really got stuck into the role and I could not imagine anybody else playing it . Congratulations again , I really believe this movie deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy . And when you get to the final scene .. well what can I say !  
0	  A remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play , nicely casting Caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie . But doing nothing else nicely at all . A under-parr performance from the actors , Law and Caine , diluted further by weak self-indulgent direction . The warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a super-modern homesetting . The subtle interplay between Oliver and Caine which made the first movie so watchable , is replaced with a horrid , brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer . But this is not the clever , to-ing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well , this is an obvious OTT character assassination of both character from the word go . This version of Sleuth is not really worth seeing , watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act .  
0	  A resurrected wrapped monster goes on a murdering binge . A lunatic is seeking revenge against living members of a previous expedition . Universal seems to be running out of wrapping as well as new ideas . Most of the budget was probably spent on Lon Chaney Jr. to star as Kharis , the Mummy . Other players are George Zucco , Wallace Ford , Turhan Bey , Dick Foran and Elyse Knox . How much longer can this madness continue ?  
0	  There is only one problem with this website , you can't give a negative rating . Additionally a mate rated this as a D grade movie . I say he was being too nice . A piece of wood could show more emotion that the actors in this movie , and the money used to produce this movie would have been better used to start a fire . This is absolutely terrible , 2 hours of life that anyone who endures this untalented bloodbath will never get back . After watching 5 minutes , myself and the boys wondered if sinking bulk heavies would make this anymore entertaining . Half a carto and a bottle of 151 later I finally found some of this G grade acting remotely funny . It 's an insult upon this entire planet that the director thought anyone could find anything beneficial from this more , he should go and buy a rope . And to the actors in this flick , I hope you got paid well to be in this joke because I doubt you will ever work again . In summary I fine everyone in this movie 100 grand and 12 demerit points off your acting licence .  
1	  This is a ' sleeper ' . It defines Nicholas Cage . The plot is intricate and totally absorbing . The ending will blow you away . See it whenever you have the opportunity .  
0	  I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a Yashraj Film . Jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach her boss , Lakhan Singh , English . The two fall in love and decide to run away but Pooja tells Jimmy that she can't do this as she owes a debt to Lakhan Singh , who is also known as Bhaiyyaji . But they decide and steal money from him and its only then that Jimmy finds out that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don . In the meantime , Bhaiyyaji hires a man , Bachchan Pandey , to track down Jimmy and Pooja . Starring Saif Ali Khan , Kareena Kapoor , Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar , the movie is directed by first time director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra . " Tashan " has to be one of the worse films that I have ever watched . Yes ! The scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor ( and her much publicised weight loss ) looks good . But plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other - hence why I have said at the beginning that I had expected more from this film as it was a Yashraj Production . With reference to songs , unfortunately , there is not one song that I can remember now . There are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could have definitely done better while Kareena Kapoor played her part well . But this cannot be said for Anil Kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain . Lastly , never mind Aditya Chopra , who in the past has produced and directed good films such as " Mohabbatein , " what was Yash Chopra doing by producing such a trash movie ? Conclusion : Bad movie , not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression .  
1	  UC 0079 , the One Year War is almost at an end . A neutral colony of Side 6 has been targeted by Cyclops , a Zeon task force . Their target , a new Gundam being built exclusively for Newtypes ( supposedly built for Amuro Ray from the original Gundam saga ) inside . When little boy Al Izuruha , a fan of Zeon MS , encounters a Zaku after battle breaks out in the colony , he befriends newbie MS pilot Benard " Bernie " Wiseman . The two become good friends , Al is treated as an honorary member of the Cyclops team . Through the show , Bernie acts as a father figure to Al ( whose real father is always working ) and seems to be taken with Federation pilot Christina McKenzie , but eventually they must meet .. in battle . Al soon learns that war is not child 's play and Bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission . For only 6 episodes , Gundam 0080 is a well done show . The mobile suits are extremely well designed , and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters . If you liked 0083 then check this one out , or if you are new to the Gundam world , this is a good show to start with . If you look to a show for drama and character development , this is the one for you , it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle . I would rate it more of a drama than action . Mobile Suit Gundam 0080 , War in the Pocket . Sometimes you have to lose to win .  
1	  Stylish , moody , innovative revenge-driven bloodbath . Also cheesy , of course , and sporadically very cheesy . It reminded me a lot of The Big Heat because it has the revenge plot set off by the exact same event , and the girl comes around to the good guy 's side because of the same bad behavior by the bad guy . It 's sad there 's no Gloria Grahame but so fantastic that it 's Alain Delon and not Glenn Ford . Could there be anyone as beautiful as Alain going around in a cashmere sweater and trenchcoat ? Yet he 's totally tough and icy cool . No one nowadays can touch him-though someone like Jude Law could try I guess . Hard for any girl to look good with him . The music was funky and perfect and there were several excellent car chases ( and those aren't generally my cup of tea ) - especially one willy nilly one in the woods . People also met their dooms in creative and bloody fashion , for instance in a junkyard cruncher . But beyond the cheese , the overall atmosphere was affecting and expertly pulled off . More creativity , excitement and freshness in that " forgotten " movie than most of what I 've seen lately .  
0	  .. and even then , even they can live without seeing it . To be honest , this film ( if one deigns to call it that ) is of real interest only to bondage freaks . Bettie Page fans will learn absolutely nothing new ( and I do mean * nothing *) , nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzies of experiencing anything familiar , loved , or cherished . Nevermind the abysmal screenplay , the wooden , less than community theater acting , the utter absence of direction , the crappy lighting , or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values . This is definitely " Hey , kids , let 's make a movie ! " movie-making of the lowest order . I suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera . No , I 'm sorry to say that none of that is germane to why this thing is so outright * wrong * . It 's wrong because the young lady playing Bettie Page , a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the Queen of Curves is dark hair and the trademark bangs , utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged . This is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess , but not for the wretched excess itself , which consists primarily of a number of lovingly re-enacted B & D set-pieces sandwiched between horrendously awful faux-biographical scenes delineating Ms . Page 's fall from grace ( so to speak ) . There 's actually probably more information , per se , about Page 's life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the movie . Do not be fooled . This is not a worthy companion film to " The Notorious Bettie Page . " This is not a worthy film at all . This is a fetish piece that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pin-ups of all time , and does it without class , without style , and without any real sense of understanding the character of Bettie Page whatsoever . No true Bettie Page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment , I guarantee that . Avoid at all costs . If free , remember that time is money , too . Yours may not be worth much , but I 'm betting it 's worth enough that you 'll be sorry you wasted time with this one . That 's it , I 'm done , you 've been warned .  
0	  Whoever gave this movie rave reviews needs to see more movies . A loser takes his camera and photographs his mental family . The movie is filled with idiots and includes live " teabagging " . That should sum it all up for you . Do not waste your time . You may want to watch the entire movie in the hopes that it gets better as it goes on - it doesn't !  
0	  Marvin ( Rob Schneider ) does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his lifelong dream . But his luck changes when he has a car crush ( a very bad one ) and is found by a doctor . The doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him . After this moment , he starts to have wild behaviours unconsciously and becomes a best cop one could ever be . By the time , he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side . In the mean time , he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave civilised . I am not a big fun of Rob Schneider . In fact , this is the his first film I have seen . However , I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser . ( See his part in Ally Mcbeal , quite funny actually ) . There are some good parts in the movie such as his flirting with the goat . In such movies , the biggest problem is that the script is seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent . I am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously . But very sad to see such films doing very good in the box office . The Animal is not the worst film I have seen to date but fails to get more than * .  
0	  ( aka : The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance ) Lots of naked babes in this one with a couple of lesbo scenes thrown in . The film is supposed to take place in Ireland but it looks more like Rome and the Adriatic to me . Gothic lesbians get invited to a Count 's island castle for the weekend . One by one they seem to be missing their heads due to a madperson running around . It 's not very scary or bloody and the rooms look like they are lit with floodlights even though candles are lit . Go figure .. ( sic ) Dubbing is worse than usual and the plot only serves as an excuse for the eroticism and nudity . Directed by euro horror actor Alfredo Rizzo , this is one snoozer . Pretty boring 2 out of 10  
1	  He 's stocky , sweaty , slightly cross-eyed and restless . He stands in front of us and calls himself a pervert . He claims that we  the film viewers  perceive the screen as a toilet bowl , and are all secretly wishing for all the s * t to explode from the inside . He 's unpredictable and scary . Well ? Come on , you could have guessed by now : he 's one of the leading philosophers of our age . Slavoj iek is both a narrator and a subject of Sophie Fiennes ' extraordinary new film , A Pervert 's Guide to the Cinema . Fiennes illustrates a feature-long lecture by iek , and does so in two ways : by providing exemplary film clips and putting iek on real ( or reconstructed ) locations from the movies he speaks about . It 's always nice to watch neatly captioned scenes from great movies ( although Revenge of the Sith got here as well ) , but the main attraction of A Pervert 's Guide is iek himself . What makes the movie such fun to watch is the unanswerable question one cannot help but ask over and over again : what is more outrageous , iek 's views or iek 's screen presence ? In a documentary by Astra Taylor ( iek ! , 05 ) , Slovenian philosopher at one point confessed his fear of being silent . Because , he claimed , he feels like he doesn't exist in the first place , the only way to make all other people believe he does is to talk constantly and feverishly . And talk he did , and how . Also A Pervert 's Guide is dominated by his voice  delivering perfect English in most crazy way , and making some astonishing points about the cinema . What are those ? Well , for example he sees Chaplin 's reluctance towards talking picture as a sign of an universal fear of voice itself ( kind of alien force taking over the human being  think the ventriloquist segment of Dead of Night [ 45 ] ) . He says that the perverse nature of cinema is to teach us to desire certain objects , not to provide us with them . He identifies Groucho Marx as super ego , Chico as ego and Harpo as id . He says a million other interesting things , and all the time we cannot take our eyes off him , so persuasive ( and captivating ) are his looks . At some point I couldn't help but stare at his thick , scruffy hair and wonder what kind of a brain lays stored underneath . Craving , of course , for more insights . Most notable are iek 's readings of Lynch and Hitchcock ( which comes as no surprise since he has written about both of them ) . The cumulative effect of many brilliantly edited clips from their respective work made those parts of iek 's lecture memorable and  unlike others  difficult to argue with , since he seems to really have gotten things right on these two directors . This doesn't go for his reading of Tarkovsky for example , upon whom he relentlessly imposes his own utterly materialistic view of reality , dismissing precisely what 's so remarkable in all Tarkovsky ( namely strong religious intuitions and images ) . The question isn't whether iek is inspiring and brilliant , because he is ; or whether Fiennes film is worth watching , because it is likewise . The real question is rather : are iek views coherent ? One smart observation after another make for an overwhelming intellectual ride , but after the whole thing is over , some doubts remain . For example : while considering Vertigo ( 58 ) iek states that what 's hidden behind human face is a perfect void , which makes face itself only a facade : something of a deception in its own means . However , when in the final sequence we hear about the ever-shattering finale of City Lights ( 31 ) as being a portrait of one human being fully exposed to another , it 's hard not to ask : what happened to the whole facade-thing ? Why should we grant Chaplin 's face intrinsic value of the real thing and deprive Kim Novak 's of this same privilege in two bold strokes ? Or maybe that incoherence might also be read in Lacan 's terms ? ( The name of the notoriously " unreadable " French psychoanalyst is fundamental to iek 's thought . ) The film has all the virtues of a splendid two and a half hours lecture : lots of ground are covered , many perspectives employed , even some first-rate wisecracks made ( when iek travels on a Melanie Daniels ' boat from The Birds [ 63 ] and tries to think as she did , he comes up with : " I want to f * k Mitch ! " ) . But it has also one shortcoming that isn't inherent to two and a half hours lecture as such : it 's almost obsessively digressive . iek 's yarn about how far are we from the Real is as good as any other psychoanalytic yarn , but after some 80 minutes it becomes quite clear that one of iek 's perverse pleasures is to ramble on and on , changing subjects constantly . Overall effect is this of being swept away by a giant , cool , fizzing wave : you 're simultaneously taken by surprise , refreshed , in mortal danger and confused no end . As you finish watching , your head is brimming with ideas not of your own and you 're already planning on re-watching some films  but you also share a sense of having survived a calamity . The ultimate question is : did iek lost it ? Or haven't we even came close to the real thing ? Once cinephilia becomes punishable by imprisonment , we shall all meet in a one big cell and finally talk to each other ( not having any movies around to turn our faces to ) . I dare you all : who will have enough guts to approach iek and defy him ? My guess is that once you look into those eyes in real life , you become a believer .  
0	  As an avid fan of the Flashman books by George McDonald Fraser , I looked forward immensely to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this film was first released . Sadly it was a huge disappointment then - so I left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again , but it was no better the second time . Mr Fraser is a tremendously skillful writer , but I am not a fan of his film screenplay work with Richard Lester . The penchant for slapstick spoilt ' The Three Musketeers ' for me and the same applies here . To me , the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong . The Flashman books are uproariously funny in parts , but they are adventure novels . There is much seriousness in the way the adventures that Flashman has - after all , he is involved in dangerous situations . This is conveyed in the novels , but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style . It is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book . When I first read that the book was to be filmed , the article said that the film was to star Oliver Reed . I rejoiced , as Reed to me was the epitome of Flashman . How I would have loved to see him in the role . Malcolm McDowell is a good actor , but does not fit the visual image of Flashman created by the books ( too scrawny looking ! Flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow ) . Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck . What kills the film is that it is made as a comedy . The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet ( Tom Bell ) . A great shame , as the production values , costumes , sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from Malcolm McDowell . Possibly the directorship of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the film is , as a recent radio adaptation of ' Flash For Freedom ' , adapted by Mr Fraser , worked quite well . Perhaps one day we may see Flashman done justice on screen .  
1	  I just saw " Of Human Bondage " for the first time a few days ago and WOW ! What a mysterious and almost spooky film . I loved how the music went with the pace of each step of Philip 's feet . It gave me the chills for some reason .. One of the greatest aspects of this film is that you get to see Bette Davis coming into herself right before your eyes . She 's great , not necessarily because this is her best work , but because it was so out of the ordinary to be so vicious , gritty , and unflinching as an actress in 1934 .. Bette was a risk taker , always wanting to be different and this is right about when she started to realize that she could be as nasty and daring as she wanted and people would love her for it . If you 're a true lover of film , it 's amazing to see .. She just had a way of delivering a line that made the part , and the film for that matter , belong to her . Like " A mass of music and fire . That 's me .. an old kazoo and some sparklers " or " But you are Blanche , you are in that chair ! " or " WITH ALL MY HEART , I STILL LOVE THE MAN I KILLED ! " .. Those are from a few of her films , but you get my drift . She was just so brave , sassy , and exotic looking with those beautiful big eyes . After seeing this , I can't believe it was remade twice .. Leslie Howard was gorgeous .. so calm and persistent , needing to be loved . I thought he was adorable and couldn't understand how everyone wasn't falling for him , but then again , everyone was .. except Mildred . He did a great job .. The only thing that I didn't like was something that was common with the writing in the early films . They 'd make a character so hateful that it 's almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place . The performances were great , but in real life , Philip would have never been interested in Mildred . That 's just the simple truth .. See it !  
0	  Dynasty Revisited in Hawaii .. Full of clichés , highly predictable , unrealistic and sometimes even stupid . If you have nothing better to do however , it does provide 40 minutes of simple , unpretensive entertainment , endless looks at great male and female muscles and very good photography of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery . On the other hand , If you are looking for anything more than that , stay away .. Oh , and by the way , if you have ever worked in a Hotel or know anything about running one , you have two options : 1 . You will feel sick every two minutes at the sheer stupidity and silliness of how the show presents Hotel Business or , 2 . Look at it as science fiction comedy as I did , lie back , relax , and laugh about it !  
1	  As shallow as it may sound , I actually delayed my viewing of " The Barbarians " several times just because the VHS cover ( as well as the picture image displayed here on the website ) looks so incredibly gay ! By now I wish I had watched it earlier because the movie isn't so much gay . just trashy , cheesy , campy and enormously fun ! It 's almost unbelievable that Ruggero Deodato , director of " Cannibal Holocaust " of all people , was the man responsible for this comical cash-in on the contemporary popular Sword & Sandal fantasy flicks , particularly Schwarzenegger 's Conan movies . The film opens with a terrific ' once upon a time ' type of off-screen narrator , introducing us to the Ragneks . Their founder once traded an entire mountain of pure gold for just one magically powerful ruby that would allow them to travel in freedom and access every country as entertainers . In other words , the Ragneks are a bunch of traveling circus freaks ! Their happiness abruptly comes to end when the greedy Kadar kidnaps the Ragneks ' beautiful queen Canary and continuously attempts to discover the whereabouts of the ruby . Meanwhile , and as some sort of amusing waste of time , the two orphan twin-brothers Gore and Kutchek are trained to become muscled warriors and they 're unwarily prepared to fight each other to the death . Instead of that , however , they escape and develop a plan to free their queen . Actually , the plot isn't half as bad as I initially feared , but still the most fun is provided by the beefcake brothers ' on screen chemistry , the crazily inept dialogs and of course the utterly cheesy fantasy-monsters , like a dragon with adorably cute eyes , some kind of werewolf creature and zombies that randomly appear to pop out of the swamp . The soundtrack and make-up effects are great and our almighty director Deodato maintains a terrifically fast pace . The Barbarian Brother 's acting capacities are much better than I anticipated , apart from the fact that one of them constantly produces gross belching sounds . The supportive cast is splendid as well . Eva La Rue never looked more beautiful as the witty savage girl Cara , Virginia Bryant is indeed bewitching like Richard Lynch states on several occasions and the lovely Sheeba Alahani makes her first and only appearance on film as a vicious sorceress with a donut-shaped hair style ( I kid you not ! ) . Last but not least , " The Barbarians " stars everybody 's favorite Eyes in the Hills creep Michael Berryman as the appropriately named Dirtmaster . I know the displayed picture looks gayer than a promotional campaign for the musical version about the rise and fall of the Village People , but " The Barbarians " really is a must-see Italian exploitation highlight .  
1	  This was the Modesty that we didn't know ! It was hinted at and summarized in the comic strip for the syndicates to sell to newspapers ! Lee and Janet Batchler were true Modesty Blaise fans who were given The Dream Job - tell a prequel story of Modesty that the fans never saw before . In their audio-commentary , they admitted that that they made changes in her origin to make the story run smoother . The " purists " should also note that we really don't know if everything she told Miklos was true because she was " stalling for time . " I didn't rent or borrow the DVD like other " reviewers " did , I bought it ! And I don't want a refund ! I watched it three times and I didn't sleep through it ! Great dialog and well-drawn characters that I cared about ( even bad guy Miklos ) just like in the novels and comic strips ! I too can't wait for the next Modesty ( and Willie ) film , especially if this " prequel " is a sign of what 's to come !  
1	  Though I did not begin to read the " Classics " in literature until I was 47 , it 's never too late . Jane Eyre is a favorite for many reasons , mainly because there isn't a part of the book I liked less , only parts I enjoyed more . The 1983 TV mini-series with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton was everything I hoped it would be . I saw it as a full length movie in 2006 . Dalton 's ' Mr. Rochester ' was very good but I absolutely loved Zelah 's ' Jane Eyre ' . Relecting on another ' Classics ' movie I saw recently , I was disappointed in the production , direction and dialogue . It was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of Hollywood . Artistic license to the great works in literature is nothing short of plagiarism . Using the title after such license is fraud . Leave it to the Brits to get this one right ( among others ) . You won't be able to reread the book without reliving the movie with it 's proper context and spirit . Well done BBC .  
1	  Talk about a blast opening , " Trampa Infernal " has the coolest opening credits ever ! Guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary " Friday the 13th " theme ( Tsh Tsh Tsh Ha Ha Ha ) , the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables . Promising intro of a totally obscure Mexican slasher / backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes . Two extremely competitive and testosterone-overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar . According to a newspaper article , there 's a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it . The challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls . Upon arrival , however , it quickly becomes obvious they 're not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve . After a whole decade of tame and derivative American slashers , this early 90 's Mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid . The formula is simplistic but efficient , the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful . The maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers , as he also uses a self-made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face . The murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric , which I was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences , and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood . The forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular . " Trampa Internal " is a Mexican slasher / survival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre .  
1	  Yes , as unbelievable as it may be , in 1968 a musical won the Academy Award for best picture - and it was the third musical to win that award in a five-year period , the first being My Fair Lady in 1964 and then The Sound of Music in 1965 . The difference between My Fair Lady , The Sound of Music and Oliver ! however is that Oliver ! is immeasurably better ! No comparison . The first two movies are insipid wet noodles compared to the remarkably robust Oliver ! . The acting is great ; the songs are great ; the story is great and the dancing is great . This movie is dynamic , topical , relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown Gangs of New York , Oliver ! offers a portrayal of poverty in 19th century London , England that evokes sympathy without being condescending . Oliver Reed was a great actor and he proves it in Oliver ! The other actors and actresses , especially Ron Moody and Shani Wallis , are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures .  
1	  The original with Barbara Stanwyk is saved only by Stanwyk 's performance . The story and the other performances are too sickeningly sweet and the film itself is too dated to be really enjoyed today . Bette Midler 's version is much more interesting . She is Stella Claire , an independent , free-spirited single woman who gets pregnant and refuses help from her boyfriend ( Stephen Collins ) or her friend ( John Goodman in an underrated performance ) . She raises her daughter Jenny played so sweetly by Trini Alvarado and then comes to the conclusion that Jenny 's father can do better for her and ultimately makes a life-altering decision . Through out the film , there are plenty of laughs , tears and memorable moments mostly between Midler and Alvarado . Marsha Mason co-stars as Jenny 's would-be stepmother , who though wealthy turns out to be a very good influence on her . If you like Midler , Goodman or just good films with plenty of emotion you 'll enjoy Bette Midler 's version of STELLA .  
1	  SERIES 1 As the UK eagerly awaits the launch of series two of ' Lost ' , series one ( which just finished showing here ) did not disappoint . A group of over forty passengers struggle to cope after their plane crash-landed into a deserted island . They pray for rescue . However , as the days turn into weeks and the survivors explore the rainforest that surrounds them , they begin to wonder whether they are alone . Admittedly , the series has a hard time keeping up the pace after the explosive pilot episodes , which hurls at the group a polar bear , a giant beastie and the possibility of others on the island . Nevertheless , the series manages to pick itself up after a few episodes and is outstanding by the final episode . Possibly the greatest thing about ' Lost ' is the fact that we visit each character 's life before the crash in a series of flashbacks . This gives us more insight and , hence more suspense and excitement as the events unfold in the present . Ultimately , this show is a superb combination of drama , suspense and the supernatural ; it is , quite simply , unmissable . SPOILERS FOR SEASON 1 FOLLOW SERIES 2 After the cliffhanger that was the end of Series 1 of ' Lost ' , Series 2 begins with our protagonists delving deep into the heart of the phenomenon that is the Hatch . They discover a mysterious man who has a job to do . Meanwhile , Michael and Sawyer struggle to cope with the aftermath of what happened on the raft . As the series progresses , the viewers will be unable to bring themselves to turn off their television set , as every episode of the series contains more twists than a Curly-Wurly chocolate bar , one of which introduces a whole host of new characters . With every mystery solved with ' Lost ' , five brand new ones seem to come out of the woodworks . After the 974th plot twist of the series , it finally dawns on the viewer that it doesn't actually matter whether the plane-crash survivors make it off the island . However , the stunning series finale answers just over half of those questions , despite its anti-climatic ending .  
0	  Doohh ! My Bwainn Hurrts ! Well it certainly does after this endurance test of a film . How on earth I managed to keep going without hitting the fast forward button lord only knows . Maybe it 's me ! Maybe I don't get the premise of the film .. or maybe I don't appreciate it 's alleged mystical atmosphere . In my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds . In addition the characters were all dreadful and there is more character development in a Tom & Jerry cartoon . Yaarrghh ! Why do I do it ? why do I watch such tripe ? It 's enough to make one run away and join a monastery or the Foreign Legion ! YAARGH ! An absolutley dreadful film in just about every respect . Apart from that it 's not to bad .  
1	  IQ is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors that seem to click well on screen . Plot is a typical guy wrong for girl , guy gets girl format , but makes the solid point that one must love with the heart and not the the mind . Addition of Albert Einstein and his band of geniuses provides excellent comic relief . Overall , a good movie . Not great , but good  
0	  I did not expect much from this film , but boy-o-boy , I did not expect the movie to be this bad . Chris Rock is not showing a good act here , you can't get the feeling that his caracter is real , I think the movie would have been a bit better if it 's drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more / better humor was involved . The movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it . In the " making of " they don't show a single smile . This is a very bad film ! I gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me , but I did never laugh !  
1	  I agree with many of the negative reviews posted here , for reasons I will go into later on . But this miniseries is powerful and convincing because the talented cast really captures the dark truth of Hitler 's world . Peter Stormare is perfect as Ernst Rohm , the brutal Brownshirt leader . Each scene he has with Hitler is explosive ! Hitler is so evil he dominates everyone but the thuggish , primitive Rohm - and he clearly digs Rohm for just that reason . The interplay between Stormare and Carlisle illuminates the way Hitler relished Rohm 's brutality , but later sacrificed him for political reasons . Jena Malone turns in a heartrending performance as Geli Raubal , Hitler 's doomed niece and the victim of his unspeakable perversions . Without revealing any of the sexual filth directly , Jena Malone plays out all the horror of the slow extinction of a young girl 's spirit . She uses her eyes and voice to suggest all the horror that will be visited on millions in the years to come . And she 's brilliant ! Zoe Telford very nearly matches Jena Malone with her portrayal of Eva Braun . Eva is clearly sick , cruel and heartless - but at the same time almost pitiably dependent on her Adolph 's twisted tenderness . The aborted lovemaking scene between them ( hinting at the spine tingling truth of Hitler 's enormous self-loathing ) is both chilling and erotic . Liev Schrieber gives a deliciously weasel-like performance as Putzi Hanfstaengel , the spineless man-about-town who is seduced by Hitler 's promises of wealth and power . While a brute like Rohm simply loves the idea of crushing skulls under his boots , Schrieber 's character is one of many Germans who abhors Nazi violence but can't resist the quick and easy route to money and power . His weak-willed fawning over Hitler soon loses him the respect of his wife , played with style and sensuality by the stunning and regal Julianna Margulies . They provide a true portrait of marriage and betrayal . These performances carry the mini series along , easily overcoming occasional weaknesses in the script . There is one exception . Regrettably , Matthew Modine 's acting chops just aren't up to snuff . His noble lunk-haid journalist ruins every scene he has - the viewer can hardly wait for Rohm 's brown-shirts to stomp that smug , righteous look off his ignorant , corn-pone low-rent Hollywood golden boy face . But the story still works . Now in regard to the factual inaccuracies of the script - Hitler 's perversions and cruelty are rendered in a vibrant , compelling drama . But the battlefield record of Corporal Hitler is badly distorted . As if afraid the audience can't handle the idea of evil and courage in the same person , the writers make Hitler look like a whining coward who " begged " for an Iron Cross . As if anyone in the Kaiser 's Army could get a medal just by whining about it ! The movie makes it look as if Hitler were a coward in the trenches , when he was a fearless soldier . They also suggest his comrades despised him , when in reality he was widely admired by officers and enlisted men alike . The depressing thing is that the mini-series succeeds so well in representing Hitler as a monster in honest ways - but they just couldn't resist the cheap shot . All in all , however , Hitler : RISE OF EVIL is a soaring success highlighted by powerful performances .  
0	  it is of course very nice to see improvements on Turkish movie industry , however , i would have expected something more creative from Togan Gokbakar . starting from the script , which i believe it was not a wise written one as some may think . especially the cheesiness of the dialogs , which were putting the audience in a position that , as if they were not smart enough to understand the situations , which , most of the times makes the movie unbearable . it also has an obvious ending ; you can easily guess the murderer from the beginning . the weakest part of the scenario is that the impossibility of seriously mentally ill patients to act like normal people , like professionals right away ! did they ever search for the possibility of patients who are on heavy medicals , to act like professionals and use all the medical terms that even normal people cannot use ? ! also in the scene where staff was searching for the most dangerous patient , with out any weapon to protect themselves was another weird point of the film . and that scene was so suitable for " Dikkat Sahan Cikabilir " title ! those are not the only weak parts of the movie . there were also a lot of preciosities in the film . the depiction of the most dangerous patient was an exact copy from Hannibal , also appearance of Togan in the very end is obviously the worst mistake that he could have done in his first movie ! the fuss about the greatness of the movie and the interviews that actor 's gave just made people to be curious and force them to see it . Gen is a total disappointment . i would have wonder , if Sahan was not this famous , would Togan be able to shoot this movie , with this much of budget amount ? i hope Togan would realize that it is not fashionable to play in a role as a director as he said in an interview . it was Hitchcock who did it wisely and Night Shyamalan continued it successfully ! he should be aware of the fact that he is not Hitchcock nor Shyamalan yet ! hoping him to be more careful and creative next time in this big industry !  
0	  The funny sound that you may hear when you eyeball this execrable version of Jules Verne 's classic " Journey to the Center of the Earth " is Verne spinning in his grave . The only thing about this 80 minute opus that has anything to do with " Journey to the Center of the Earth " is the title . Otherwise , everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching . In fact , the director has written here at IMDb . COM that he directed only eight minutes of " Journey to the Center of the Earth " and the studio tacked on part of " Dollman " helmer Albert Pyun 's sequel to his own " Alien from L.A. " with Kathy Ireland . Evidently , the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas contractual obligations , they grafted Pyun 's sequel onto director Rusty Lemorande 's movie . Please , don't rent or buy this wretched piece of garbage . Unlike director Henry Levin 's period piece " Journey to the Center of the Earth " ( 1959 ) with James Mason and Pat Boone , Lemorande 's " Journey to the Center of the Earth " takes place in contemporary times in Hawaii . Two fellows , a British nanny , and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence . Richard ( Paul Carafotes of " Blind Date " ) and his comic book obsessed brother Bryan ( Ilan Mitchell-Smith of " Weird Science " ) are going out to explore a cave . The heroine , Crystina ( Nicola Cowper of " Underworld " ) , works for a domestic service called ' Nannies R Us . ' Being a nanny has been Crystina 's life-long dream , but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs . Nevertheless , her sympathetic supervisor , Ms . Ferry ( Lynda Marshall of " Africa Express " ) , sends her to Hawaii . Crystina 's new client , rock star Billy Foul ( Jeremy Crutchley of " Doomsday " ) who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career , has a dog named Bernard . Foul wants Crystina to take Bernard to a doggie day spa . Crystina is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a careless motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that conceals Bernard in Richard 's jeep . You see , Foul has hidden his canine in a basket because motel management strictly prohibits pets on their premises . Foul has disguised the dog as a human baby . Anyway , Crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow Richard . After she catches up with them to get her dog , the cabbie cruises away and abandons her . Crystina demands that Richard drive her back to town , but he has other plans . Unhappily , Crystina joins the guys and they get lost , and then find themselves in the lost city of Atlantis , a police state ruled by a dictator , at the center of the Earth . The rulers of Atlantis repeatedly notify their citizens that life on the surface does not exist . Our heroes and heroine stumble onto Atlantis quite by accident . Atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera . The ruler of Atlantis , General Rykov ( Janet Du Plessis of " Operation Hit Squad " ) , is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human , Wanda Saknussemm ( Kathy Ireland of " Necessary Roughness " ) , to visit Atlantis . Predictably , General Rykov machinations to rule Atlantis and overthrow the Earth fails , and our heroes and heroine save the day . " Journey to the Center of the Earth " is an abomination . The movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about dictatorships . Albert Pyun is one of my favorite low budget action directors , but he blew it on this lightweight shambles of a science fiction saga .  
1	  Hurrah ! A space film that doesn't take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp . The film starts slowly , the usual mix of idiots and high-fliers mixed together into a dodgy soup . But when the going gets tough - the tough get themselves sorted out and it 's not an un-believable change in the characters as you can believe that there 's some responsibility in their young minds . The only flaw in the film is that Kate Capshaw is EXTREMELY annoying as the " I 'm right and you 're all wrong " instructor . I would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 Vote .  
0	  Same old same old about Che . It completely ignored the really interesting facts of Che 's true character . Sodeberg redid the same boring narrative of Che . The silly seductive tale of an Argentinean rich-boy who was so shocked by poverty he became a Robin Hood fighting alongside the poor , until eventually he was murdered by the CIA . Yeah , yeah , heard it all before , BORING AND UNTRUE ! . The reality of Che Guevara is very different and far more explosive ! The facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah streak , who openly wanted to impose Maoist tyranny on the world . He was so fanatical that at the hottest moment in the Cold War , he even begged the Soviet Union to nuke New York , Washington or Los Angeles and bring about the end of the world . CHe urged Khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against US cities . For the rest of his life , he declared that if his finger had been on the button , he would have pushed it . When Khrushchev backed down and literally saved the world , Che was furious at the " betrayal " . If Che 's recommendations had been followed , you would not be reading this review now . How a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film . Incredible that no filmmaker has been daring enough to show the real side of Che and his posthumous media transformation . THAT WOULD MAKE AN Oscar WINNING FILM ! I thought making independent film meant taking REAL RISKS and being GROUNDBRAKING ! They only stick to " safe counterculture themes " , to wit , " Che cool " , " Wall Street bad " , " Republican = Nazi " , " Bush ex Hitler " , " NRA is worse than KGB " , " Christians are fanatics and stupid " , etc .. ad nauseum . Oooh , how daring , how mind blowing . Tres anti-mainstream and edgy . I wish they would have some real cojones and tackle the Independent Film Oligarchy ! That would be truly daring !  
0	  OK .. This is the third in the series of carnosaur . Lets star with the dinosaur puppets ! In the start of the film you cant See the Dino 's cause when the body count starts you can only See the Dino 's eye vision , pretty smart to hide the bad puppets ! and maybe in 16 minutes forward on the film some special force team with Scott Valentine as the leader Rance , the team walks into the warehouse and then they begins to find body parts and dead body 's after the Dino rampage , after a while some big box comes failing on the team and you can hear a velociraptor scream , pretty creepy ! and then a black girl walks forward and now one blooper is found ! It pops up a raptor hand and slashed her face but if you pause when the raptor hand comes you can See that its just a guy with a hand puppet ! ? WTF ! The story is simple . 1 . Some terrorist 's attacks some truck cause they though It wash some weapons in there . 2 . They where dead wrong it seams to be ten tons raptor and one giant t-Rex in there ! How did the t-Rex fit in there ? 3 . Rance and some nerds will kill the dinosaurs ! Sadly some stupid blond girl told him to capture one of them alive = ( 4 . Holy Jesues the raptors have wheels on their feats ! 5 . The Dino 's is now on a boat in the pacific . 6 : Strange i didn't know that the t-Rex had a strange thing on hes neck ? 7 . THE END . The film is good if you want a good laugh . 5/10  
0	  I purchased this film for $ 5 in a bargain bin at my local video store for one reason only , Chase Masterson , but I should have crumbled up the five , thrown it in a toilet and flushed . The film is about a bunch of twenty somethings that peaked in high school and reunite on the anniversary of their idiot friends death , who got drunk and wandered into the woods and died . There problem is a reptilian monster is hunting them down one by one . The acting is abysmal , these worthless people were apparently cast offs on shows like 90210 and Dawsons Creek . The directing was on par with a twelve year old and the script was probably done by a thirteen year old . The entire set looks like someone 's backyard in Malibu . The people on here that have praised this film are obviously friends of the director and / or actors . Avoid this pile of garbage at ALL costs .  
0	  I truly wish I was not writing this review . I 'm a Christian , so I waited anxiously to see this movie . It seemed great - a Christian movie with some fairly famous stars and a plot that seemed intriguing ( not that I buy the Bible Code itself - you can make it say anything you want . I do , however believe everything inside the Bible ) . So I 'm sitting on the edge of my seat enjoying the previews , when the movie comes on and manages to destroy my mood in a matter of minutes . I had to bite my lip to stop from commenting on the terrible writing and acting while I was in the theater ( I would have been torn to pieces by the people cheering at the rather clumsy but basically uplifting scenes and gasping at the insanely obvious and predictable Tension Scenes , I 'm sure ) . Once the final credits began to roll , however , I could reflect . There were many parts of the movie I liked - some mostly unexpected plot twists , some effects that were indeed special ( I 'm not counting the Visions . Those were poorly done ) , and some interesting technical work - fades , sets , that type of thing . Unfortunately , I got the distinct impression that if I read the book of Revelation to a monkey and set the monkey in front of a typewriter for an hour , I could 've gotten a better script . And the music was beyond cheesy ( even for a Bond fan who likes kinda cheesy music in scenes of action and intrigue ) . So I wish I could be like everyone else in the theater - like the people who came out crying and breathless because of how incredible it was - but I 'm not someone who can be appeased by a writer who throws some words over a Biblical shell and slaps a Christian stamp on it . I need a good plot and believable dialogue before I can enjoy most movies , and this just didn't have either . I 'm sorry , but I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone . And that 's the tragedy . When will we see some intelligent Christian fiction ? It has to be out there somewhere ..

With Bo 's attributes , John 's unique direction , Quinn 's film presence , and , thanks to John , a very pretty exotic look to the entire film , this movie is pleasant viewing .  
1	  You can survive Surviving Christmas . I thought the television version was a bit edited way down . I like Ben Afleck . He plays Drew Johnson , a family-less adult , who is willing to pay complete strangers . The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco , the daughter . Drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars . Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maude 's husband Arthur is hired to play Duda , the grandfather . When the whole situation comes crashing down , the truth can be painful . The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation . Drew 's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit . You can't buy what you wish for ! The acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene .  
1	  I searched for this movie for years , apparently it ain't available here in the States so bought me a copy off Ebay . Four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods searching for a bear that apparently has killed several campers . What they find is an ex-Vietnam vet gone crazy ( he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal finger nails a la Freddy Krueger ) . As soon as the night falls , one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend , she gets killed . After one of the group finds her body , they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight . Once the sun comes up , all of them try and make it out , but fall victim one by one . Seven bodies , not a lot of gore , but a couple of good murders , especially the girls'deaths . The guys get killed in somewhat bloodless ways ( blown up in car , shot to death , knife through head ) . Overall , INFERNAL TRAP is a nice slasher film from the late 80 's . Nothing new , just well acted , fast paced and some pretty ladies . 10 out of 10 .  
0	  This whole film should have lasted 45 minutes - maximum . Although an interesting concept / theme , it really did not develop as a story . Once the initial idea of a brave ( stupid ? ) bomb disposal expert ( cowboy ? ) are introduced , and this happens very early in the film , the rest is repetitious . Characters were not explored , and aspects of the location and politics were ignored . There was some nice insight into the appalling difficulties faced by troops in such a foreign environment , and the difficulties in differentiating between friend and foe . But the way in which the unit operated stretched belief ! Individual performances were good , and special effects were adequate , but not enough to overcome the basic lack of content .  
1	  SPOILERS Tom and Jerry is a classic cartoon , with a flawless idea , and almost every single short is a gem . While I must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic Tom and Jerry shorts , there is not way you can hate this cartoon . Sure , it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first Tom and Jerry episodes , and I can say that I agree , but the fact of the matter is that all Tom and Jerry episodes are great , but some are just better than others . Well , this would fit into " others . " Here is the plot of Fraidy Cat . Tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast , and becomes easily frightened . Jerry observes how scared he is , and tries to scare him even more than he already is . He creates scary dilemmas for Tom , and Tom becomes scared out of his wits , and his lives . Jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it , thus making it look like the vacuum is a ghost . Tom finds out that Jerry did all of this , and chases him . Tom then accidentally bites the house maid . However , at the end Jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cup . Overall , this is far from the best Tom and Jerry short out there , but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time . It makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this . The slapstick and gags in this that make Tom and Jerry famous are as good as ever in this short , but it felt like something was missing in this . It felt slower than most Tom and Jerry shorts . Anyway , this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other Tom and Jerry cartoons , but it is still nice . 7/10  
0	  Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and leaves out two key things : action and thrills . THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task . Richard Widmark , Edward Albert , and Eli Wallach are his operatives - they presumably work for the government , but that , like most of the movie 's plot line , is never made clear . Hackman asks a lot of questions that NEVER get answered so the film goes absolutely nowhere . While it strives to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW , THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes up ambiguity and mystery with confusion and boredom . The film is extremely well photographed but even that works against it . Kramer 's direction is devoid of any style . It 's a very sunny movie ! The acting is fine with Hackman proving he 's pretty much incapable of being bad . Widmark and Wallach are suitably nasty and Albert is well cast as Widmark 's cruel lackey . Even the usually obnoxious Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman 's sidekick . One oddity however is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman 's wife . We 're told she 's done time in prison and she seems to be trying to put on some sort of southern twang . Kramer 's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear an ugly brown wig . It 's a role better suited for the likes of Valerie Perrine or Susan Tyrell .  
1	  * SPOILERS * * SPOILERS * This is without a doubt the best film Rainer Werner Fassbinder ever made and even with the marvelous script the film is enhanced by a great performance by Hanna Schygulla . Film starts out with Maria ( Schygulla ) and Hermann Braun ( Klaus Lowitsch ) just getting married as the bombs continue to fall and Hermann is shipped out towards the waning days of the war and now Maria and her mother and sister must scrape by to survive . Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club that caters to American GI 's and she meets a black Army soldier named Bill ( Greg Eagles ) and they start to see one another on a steady basis . Maria hears that her husband Hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with Bill . But one day while getting intimate with Bill they see Hermann at the door . He hasn't died and when he enters the room a scuffle occurs and Maria breaks a bottle over Bill 's head and he dies . Hermann takes the blame and he is sentenced to a long term in jail so Maria tells him that she will succeed at something and get him out . The war has ended and Germany must rebuild and one day on a train Maria meets Karl Oswald ( Ivan Desny ) who is a successful businessman in textiles and she uses her charms to get a job . Maria is determined to do well and climbs the corporate ladder and becomes Karl 's mistress . She tells him that she will never marry him but he is in love with her . Hermann gets out of jail but goes to Canada to try and get over everything that Maria has done since he has been locked up . * SPOILER ALERT * One day Karl dies and leaves Maria just about everything in his will and Maria buys her own house . Then Hermann finally comes home to his wife and they are both ready to start they 're marriage even though they have been married for some time now . But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both of them still in it . There are so many interesting things in this film that its one of those movies that can be studied and talked about to great lengths . Like in all Fassbinder films the use of color is used in a very interesting way . As the film begins the tones are brown and gray to represent war torn Germany but as Maria starts to become successful they change to bright rich colors like red and white . The rebuilding of Germany with all the sounds of construction are used as only backdrop and the film stays focused on the exploits of Maria . Fassbinder did want the sounds of rebuilding to remind us of what was going on in Germany at that time . Hanna Schygulla was never better and her performance is the key to the success of this film . With a lesser actress this would have been just another interesting film but Schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this film to an elite status . Schygulla shows Maria as very determined and smart but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants . She 's not embarrassed nor does she feel guilty about this and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive . Schygulla wasn't nominated for an Academy Award but she gave a great performance that will stand the test of time . Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother Lilo Pempeit plays Frau Ehmke . I have heard many things about the ending of the film and it has to do with whether Maria purposely left the gas on . Later in the bathroom she is running water over her wrist and she appears to be sad . This is only speculation and if you think I 'm wrong please e-mail me . I think she was overly excited by Hermann being home and left it on by accident ( Remember her putting on a dress for no reason ? ) . Then when the will is being read to her its at that point that she learns that Hermann and Karl had become friendly without her knowledge and I think she felt that everything she had done was for nothing . Thats the reason for the bathroom scene . So when the house explodes its by accident . But I think the reason for Fassbinder having an ending like that is to show that anyone who would sell their soul has no business living . Fassbinder was fascinated by survivors but he was also incredibly passionate . In his view Maria can't have it both ways . A fascinating film .  
1	  Splendid film that in just eight minutes displays an unusual genre mix : mystery , thriller , musical . Briefly , we are allowed to tell about the story : a girl comes into a European Cafeteria and then .. Soft transit from nonsense mystery to narrative logic . In a no time , no place way Vigalondo managed a delight in B / W by means of imagination and despite ( thanks to ) the tightest of budgets . Because of the unity of time-space the film reaches the intensity of a short poem ( almost a haiku ) . Spain , land of quick poetry in B / W ( ¿remember the early Buñuel ? ) . A must see for reassuring our belief in young cinema outside the States .  
1	  Last year we were treated to two movies about Truman Capote writing the book from which this film was made - Capote and Infamous . I cannot imagine a movie like this being made in 1967 . A stark , powerful and chillingly brutal drama ; elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of Richard Brooks ( Elmer Gantry , Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , The professional , Blackboard Jungle ) . It is interesting that Robert Blake , who starred in this film , has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this film . This is a film that stays with you after viewing .  
0	  It 's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film . An entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as ' humor ' or even ' entertainment ' in " Rabbit Test . " So , as a small contribution to this future effort , I 'd like to suggest this word : " Hubiriffic " ( adj . ) A combination of ' hubristic ' and ' terrific ' ; used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film " Rabbit Test . " Joan Rivers and " Hollywood Squares " producer Jay Redack have severely over-reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness . Trying to put together an Airplane ! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags , ( Note to Joan : German doctors haven't been funny since Vaudeville ) disinterred from their graves in the Catskills - that 's is bad enough . But compounding this cinematic crime is River 's directorial style , which can best be described as ' ugly ' , and a cast of once-and-future has-beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags . Adrift in this Sargasso Sea of sap is a hapless Billy Crystal in his film debut role as the film 's hapless protagonist Lionel . Watching Crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield ; eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face . I can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like Rabbit Test . Cabbages , mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates . But for self-aware , thinking humans - I 'd enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before I 'd recommend " Rabbit Test . "  
1	  This deserves a 12 out of 10 . An absolutely refreshing show with real characters and real stories . This show needs to come back , I 've seen every episode and this is real quality . The show centers around a couple of New Yorkers , plays around with the concept of the six degrees of separation and cleverly intertwines their lives . Bridget Moynahan and Jay Hernandez are stunning and so is the adorable Caseman . The scenery is amazing and wardrobes are exquisite . We need more shows like this that makes viewers feel like they are intelligent individuals not mindless drones . If it never comes back , six degrees will be sorely missed .  
0	  .. but the trouble of this production is that it 's very far from a good musical . Granted , one can't always expect the witty masters like Sondheim or Bernstein or Porter ; yet the music of this piece makes even Andrew Lloyd Webber look witty . It 's deadly dull and uninventive ( with one or two exceptions ) and just after I watched it I couldn't recall a single significant melody - which is rather tragic coming from someone who learned the whole Another Hundred People from three listenings . It is also strangely un-theatrical . It takes place on an incredibly large stage ( one really has to feel sorry for those people in front rows who broke their necks in order to see something happening 50 meters on the right or 100 meters on the left ) and does absolutely nothing with it . When there 's supposed to be one person singing on-stage , that 's just what you get - and the rest of the enormeous stage is empty . For me as an aspiring theatre director it was almost painful to watch . The fact remains , Cole Porter seems to have captured the French culture in his works better than these no-talents can ever come close to . And I 'm puzzled by the popularity of this would-be-legendary musical .  
1	  I really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one . First of all , I find this short-film very entertaining and interesting . I just take it for what it is . I think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher . One other thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved even though there is no clear story , just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters that kind of give you the impression that there is a story to all that is going on . No-one else could have done that better than Lynch . This is the essence of lynchianism at its best . Sure , I will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewer 's side , will find themselves disappointed . And in good right . Lynch is not about that . At least this side of Lynch is not . The one that helped make Lost Highway / Mulholland Dr. is at full tilt here and people that just expect to be entertained like they would watching anything else , will just not get what this is all about . My opinion is that Darkened Room is all about messing with your animal-core , your instinctual self , by giving you the means ( image , sound , situation ) by which you instinctively react . It 's not about pleasure of any kind , it 's about getting the desired reaction out of you . And , that , my friend , is pure art .  
0	  I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982 . I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just amazingly bad . I remember Richard Burton 's character looking so hopelessly lost , and then remembering how his motivations didn't translate to me . In short , I remember " Circle of Two " because it was so phenomenally awful . This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality . Recall " The Blue Lagoon " ( and other Brooke Shields annoyances ) , " Lipstick " , " Little Darlings " , " Beau Pere " and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex , particularly with adults . As a teenager during this time , I found the obsession , combined with the sexual excesses of the 70 's and 80 's , made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out , so to speak . " Circle of Two " is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient , like " Blue Lagoon " . In fact , it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave , if totally failed , way . But honestly , it is one of those films you will * never * see if you didn't see it on its first run because it was so truly awful . No one would want to have this garbage ever surface to be publicly distributed again .  
0	  I 'm actually watching this film as I write this . . . If the following comments " prove my lack of development as a true , artistic film maker " , then so be it . . . But . . . I thought ( am still thinking as I 'm presently viewing ) that this film . . . to put it mildly , is very , very overrated . Again , very . It looks like a really , really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources . . . and who didn't pay that much attention to detail . I don't want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that I find this film lacking , but . . . well . . . I just don't get it ( rememeber , I fully admit that maybe it 's ME that 's the idiot here - not the film maker - for not getting this " piece of imaginative genius " ) . . . I rented this on a whim because the reviews were very , very outstanding . . . Sheesh . . .  
0	  Lordi was a major hype and revelation in 2007 because they won the Eurovision Song Contest with a ( not-so-heavy ) metal song called " Hard Rock Hallelujah " and appeared on stage dressed like hideous monsters . But , let 's face it , their victory most likely had very little to do with their great musical talents . The Eurovision contest gradually turned into one big political circus over the years and Lordi probably just won because their song finally brought a little change and  even more importantly - because their whole act sort of ingeniously spoofed the whole annual event . The absolute last thing Lordi 's first ( and hopefully last ) horror film brings is change and ingenuity . " Dark Floors " , based on an idea of the lead singer and starring the rest of the band in supportive roles , is a truly unimaginative and hopeless accumulation of clichés . The immense budget ( " Dark Floors " supposedly is the most expensive Finnish film ever ) definitely assures greatly macabre set pieces and impressive make-up art , but what 's the point where there 's no story that is worth telling ? The film takes is set in a busy hospital where a bunch of people , among them a father and his young daughter with an unidentifiable illness , become trapped in the elevator during a power breakdown . When the doors open again , the floors are empty and it looks as if the hospital lies abandoned since many years already . Trying to reach the exit , the group stumbles upon several morbid and inexplicable obstacles , like eyeless corpses , screaming ghosts and Heavy Metal monsters emerging from the floors . The only three points I 'm handing out to " Dark Floors " are exclusively intended for the scenery and the adequate tension building during the first half of the film . For as long as the sinister events don't require an explanation , the atmosphere is quite creepy , but as soon as you realize the explanation will a ) be very stupid or b ) never come , the wholesome just collapses like an unstable house of cards . Lordi 's costumes never really were scary to begin with ( except maybe to traditional Eurovision fans ) and , in combination with a story more reminiscent to Asian ghost-horror , they just look downright pathetic and misfit . With all the national myths and truly unique exterior filming locations , I personally always presumed Finland  The Land of a Thousand Lakes  would be the ideal breeding ground for potentially horrific horror tales , but I guess that 's another disillusion on my account .  
0	  I 've said this in other reviews , without a story , you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want , still no one will give a damn . The director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco ( which I love ) , and I think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making . However , it 's obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie , he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned-plotted film . ( SPOILER ) For crying out loud , they forgot to have a villain in this thing ! OK they have one , but he 's been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place . Conran misses the point of HAVING a villain . As far as action goes , well let 's see , Sky Captain ( Law ) shoots down ONE robot , two or three of the flapping wing airplanes ( before Dex ( Ribisi ) tells him to stop shooting them down ! ) , and a couple robots , but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him . Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie ( the reviewer who comments on hers and Law 's lack of chemistry is so right ) and I for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera , showing she ONLY HAS TWO SHOTS LEFT , both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie , one uncomically , one quite funny , although I saw it coming from 70 years away . No one except Law and Paltrow have any significant time on screen , and that 's the movie 's real flaw . An audience doesn't identify with robots , they need a hero to root for , and a visible , despicable villain to hate . Without that , plus a good engaging story , all the CG in the world won't help .  
1	  Very smart , sometimes shocking , I just love it . It shoved one more side of David 's brilliant talent . He impressed me greatly ! David is the best . The movie captivates your attention for every second .  
0	  this movie was so gay like its a mom and son cat that have sex , they also get scared of little kitty cats . they get set on fire by them . the mom cat alien thing kills a guy by stabbing him in the back with an ear of corn ? they are bullet proof . invisible . and what not . the star of the movie , Clovis , is the cops cat , Clovis leads the cops to find the mom alien , and after the mom kills the cops , Clovis kills the mom by eating her head then she catches on fire . this movie sucks . it was way way more funny than it was scary , it wasn't even scaryt at all . the girl hits the alien on the head with a camera , it knoks him out . she then goes and hugs her . the then grabs her and begins to rape her . once again , Clovis comes to the rescue  
1	  Very slow-paced , but intricately structured and ultimately very touching . A nice , very true-to-life look at a small Florida beach town in the dead of winter - I 've been there , and this is absolutely accurate . It 's also the debut feature of actress Ashley Judd , and she makes a big impression here . It 's hard to believe this film is 12 years old - I remember seeing it in theaters , and I recently rented " Ruby " again . Except for the 80 's looking clothes , it has held up very nicely . Ashely is so radiant and touching here , that it 's hard to think of her subsequent career without wincing . Boy , talk about failing to fulfill your early promise ! Anyone seeing Ashley here in " Ruby In Paradise " would assume this elegant , natural beauty went on to all kinds of interesting art films and serious acting - instead she has become the " go to " girl for dumb action films and slasher movies ! Very disappointing , but at least we have this lovely performance preserved to showcase her early promise . As some other commenter 's say , this is not for everyone as it 's very slow paced . This is not an action film , nor is it really a romance . The director ( Victor Nunez , " Ulees Gold " , another excellent character study ) treats this ordinary young woman 's life with deep respect , allowing her story to build slowly and with a lot of detail . In that way , I think this is one of the most moving and respectful coming-of-age stories about young women that I can recall - it 's not about Ruby 's sexual awakening or " how she lost her virginity " , but about her life choices and her growing maturity . A lovely film , if you take the time to watch it .. I think it would be a really excellent film to show teens and young girls ( or boys for that matter ) and give them a chance to think about and discuss it . Particular kudos to director Nunez , who also wrote the script , which is so realistic and nicely detailed that I assumed all through the movie that it was based on a female-written novel or memoir , but in fact it 's Mr. Nunez 's original work . Rated 8 out of 10 .  
1	  Moonwalker is absolutely incredible ! What else can I say ! ? Michael Jackson is the true King of pop , rock and soul ! Moonwalker has everything ! Great story line , fantastic music , great visual effects , and of course it has Michael Jackson !  
0	  On the 1998 summer blockbuster hit BASEketball ( 1998 ) : " This is one of those movies that is usually seen on the big jumbo-tron screen in a sports bar during the day - when everyone is quite drunk . Unfortunately , I was sober when I saw this movie . " So quoted the late Gene Siskel for this lame-brained , supposed yukfest that came out two weeks after the far superior " There 's Something About Mary " in a one-upmanship game during July of 1998 . " Mary " was a gross-out fest , but in addition to the many gags , it had a lot of heart , which is why it was the highest grossing comedy of that memorable summer . " BASEketball " tried to outdo Mary , but it fizzled in more ways that one . You take the creators of " South Park , " Trey Parker and Matt Stone , who are fortunately not behind the movie but in front of the camera , the only member of ZAZ David Zucker helming the picture in desperate need of a paycheck , and the other two Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker clearly stayed out or probably warned him against the picture , a small bit by now 90 years young Ernest Borgnine , wasting his precious time in his distinguished career , dying on a hotdog and singing " I 'm Too Sexy " as he videotapes his will , Jenny McCarthy , who has little screen time as Borgnine 's not-too-weeping trophy widow young enough to be his granddaughter , a bigger female part by Yasmine Bleeth as a dedicated social worker whose charges are underprivileged youngsters , and the only interesting and meaningful player in this turkey , Robert Vaughn as a corrupt archrival , and pointless cameos by " Airplane ! " alumni Kareem Abdul Jabaar and the late Robert Stack who seemed nostalgic for the 1980 masterpiece and it 's much fresher humor created by the ZAZ family . What do all these people make up ? A desperate cast and crew trying to replicate " Airplane ! " humor and mixing it up with the crudity of " South Park , " but failing in every way . To make this long 100-minute movie short , " BASEketball , " a real game invented by David Zucker and his friends in his hometown of Milwaukee , is about two lazy losers ( Parker and Stone ) and their pint-sized mutual friend who invent baseball and basketball ( hence the title ) together on the driveway of one 's house . After Borgnine dies , he bequeaths the ownership of his BASEketball team , the Milwaukee Beers to Parker and Stone . Sure enough , the game goes national , and archrivals Vaughn and McCarthy want to take away ownership of the Beers team from them . But Bleeth is in love with both men , particularly Parker , and one poor , sick charge in need of a liver transplant goes ga-ga over them . Those are the characters , not strongly developed . Now witless gags ensue . Blood , electroshock hair , egg-throwing and screaming are among them . Parker and Stone nearly kill the youngster in the hospital , but he pulls through the liver transplant . Borgnine sings and rubs ointment on his chest in the videotaped will . McCarthy , who seemed to get over Borgnine 's death by choking on a frank right away , quickly massages Vaughn in the next scene . Cheerleaders dance in skimpy outfits . There is plenty of music on the soundtrack that is played for the hard of hearing . And David Zucker forces the parodies of " Riverdance " and " Titanic . " Parody forcing is nothing new to ZAZ , post " Airplane ! " and " The Naked Gun " series . And like Siskel , I was sober as well , but I was also getting sleepy . This movie should be played over and over to coarse-mannered barroom patrons who enjoy it as they chug down beers , but will they remain alert and awake , or pass out during the unfunny parts ? If they pass out , then they won't realize that they are luckily missing stupidity and absurdity . Hats off to them !  
0	  OK . So it 's a low-budget " film " ( I used the quotes because it was shot in Hi-8 video ) . The acting is universally horrid , the makeup is laughable ( the blood looks like it came from Sherwin-Williams and I 've seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits ) , and the lighting generally looks like they used someone 's borrowed Toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actors . I might be able to forgive these low-budget traits if there were some actual content , if a movie made an attempt to tell a story . But this collection of video footage can boast of no plot , no real characters , and no momentum . It 's a self-indulgent mess . And don't worry - no spoilers here , ' cause there 's absolutely nothing to spoil .  
1	  A woman borough a boy to this world and was alone . They both were alone because a boy had a gift and a curse in one package - he was capable of withdrawing sword from his arm . There was always a wound on his wrist in the cause of this " gift " - the wound of the deadliest weapon inside of his body . First he kills his constantly drunk stepfather who hurts his mom every time . Then he grows up and decides to find his real father . Just as simple as all the time for a superhero - he reaches the justice .. but the society decides this justice is not necessary and dangerous which is indeed right ' cause it is not like in Hollywood movies that the character does not try to kill anyone - Sasha ( he is the main hero acted by Artem Tkachenko ) kills if the person who in his opinion deserves to die but gets blames from authorities and runs . In such a runaway from authorities and Mafia he meets a girl ( acted by Chulpan Hamatova ) and falls in love with her . Everything else is to be watched .. not told . Be aware that this film is more about feelings and emotions but not about actions . This film is full of pain of the main character full of him and his vision of life .  
1	  Ahh , Talespin ! What can I say that hasn't already been said about this great show ? Nothing ! This is without a doubt one of the most well-written shows I 've ever encountered , live-action or animation . The newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes , and some of the " mature " stuff I have to shoo kids out of the room for . But not Talespin . The stories are engaging and very plausible . Some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie . Episodes like Stormy Weather and Her Chance to Dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike . Then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the Bluest of the Baloo Bloods and Stuck on you , where the emphasis is on hilarity . I can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones . The drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays ( at least , those which aren't specifically geared toward it ) , especially in cartoons . In the episode Stormy Weather for instance , Kit Cloudkicker decides that he 's going to join an air circus , but Baloo believes that it would be too dangerous . In the biggest fight of the episode , Baloo yells at Kit to stay away from Daring Dan , to which Kit screams " NO ! You can't tell me what to do ! YOUR 'RE * NOT * * MY * * DAD * ! " and buries his face in his pillow . The next day he leaves for the air circus . This kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon , and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays . The Characters have a lot of depth to them . Baloo is pretty much the way he is in The Jungle Book , plus or minus a few degrees of laziness . Rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money , while good in theory , are seldom good in practice . Molly is a cute little girl , but you can't let that deceive you . She can be a real hellion sometimes . Kit Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest . He doesn't trust adults much unless they appeal to him , and he has a tendency to break off relationships . Watch his expression in Plunder and Lightning when he grabs the grappling hook : he looks as though he 's prepared to put it right through a pirate . In the end , it 's the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show # 1 in my book . The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real , almost father and son . This is demonstrated well in All 's Whale That Ends Whale when Baloo takes Kit 's word for it that Seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults . Baloo and Becky 's relationship is also realistic , due to Baloo 's motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol ' Sea Duck , not necessarily a desire to help Rebecca . But something tells me that if he did get the Duck back he 'd still do jobs for Rebecca . The Sea Duck , not to mention all the other planes in the series , is pretty realistically designed . The plane 's functions don't change once throughout the series ( continuity like that is hard to come by also ) , and unlike most other " super-planes " of other cartoons , it doesn't have one single weapon on board ( unless you count mangoes ! ) , and relies instead on it 's cunning pilot 's great skill to get out of trouble . It 's hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn't have some sort of gun turret , laser cannon , or even a handgun somewhere on board . And the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays . Plus it 's just such a darn cool design ! This is definitely the best cartoon . Ever . Period . Definitely worth all ten stars !  
1	  Sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hands ( Wayne 's World , the first one , not the second ) . But most often they have duds ( It 's Pat comes to mind rather quickly ) . This time out it 's Tim Meadows as The Ladies Man . This movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud . It was very funny for the first 20 minutes , but then , as usually happens with SNL skits , it starts to slow down , before finally ending , long after it should have . Tim Meadows is Leon Phelps , a radio DJ with a nightly show called The Ladies Man . He answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships , usually in the crudest way possible . Everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt . After pushing the buttons of the station manager , Leon , along with his producer Julie ( Karyn Parsons ) gets fired , and needs to find another job . Out of the random blue , comes a letter from one of his ex-ladies . The letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life , the only problem being that the letter isn't signed . So Leon needs to track down all the women he 's been with to find the woman of his dreams . But sometimes , as Billy Dee Williams says in the film , the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you . There is also a sub-plot about a bunch of guys who 's wives / girlfriends have all slept with Leon , and they want to first figure out who he is ( by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy ) , then kill him . Leading this bunch of guys is , surprise ! Will Ferrell from SNL . First off , I thought the sub-plot was rather lame . The singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless . I usually like Will Ferrell but here he just never clicked for me . And the rest of the guys were just schlubs who tagged along , and in the end all decided that having their wives / girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault . So back to the main story . The story basically centers around Leon and sex . So what it comes down to is , if you don't like the character of Leon , you won't like the movie . His voice , his mannerisms , his dialogue is what carries the movie . I am not a big fan of Tim Meadows . I never thought he was a particularly good actor on SNL . The only thing I ever really liked of his , was his Ladies Man skits . But the best thing about those , is that they usually involved the guest host ( remember the one with Cameron Diaz ? ) , and they were short . For about 5 minutes , they were pretty funny . And here , for about 20 minutes , it 's really funny . What I thought was good about the character in the movie , is that he stayed in character throughout . He never wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona . Until right at the end where there was this transformation , and the ever present speech to tie things up . Other than that , it was pretty good at keeping Leon as Leon , and not changing him into something less crude than he was . There isn't a lot of substance to this movie , if you couldn't guess . But like I said earlier , the beginning of the movie I found to be very funny . Some real laugh out loud moments , all revolving around sex and his crudeness . The problem of course with this movie , and most other SNL spin offs , is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time . Stretching the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult . That difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub-plot , because without it , this movie would have been a little under an hour . When it was good , it was good , but when it wasn't good , it got to be boring . So overall , The Ladies Man wasn't as bad as other SNL films , but it wasn't as good as others . It had some funny moments , the first 20 minutes was pretty good , but the rest of it dragged on . There was an unnecessary sub-plot whose only purpose was to lengthen the film . The bottom line is , if you like Tim Meadows and his Leon Phelps character , you 'll be able to watch the film . If he annoys you , don't even bother going . Unless you just want to see Tiffani Theissen in some nice revealing clothing .  
0	  Yet another Die Hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains How many more of these god awful cheaply ( and badly ) made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980 's and early 1990 's are there still lurking out there ? For the record ( not that you will care really ) this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of Die Hard , Under Siege and Speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichés and predictability . The non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses , the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son . The supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in New Zealand ! The acting is as wooden as the deck , the script woeful , the one liners predictable , the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through . There seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the DVD bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere ( although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a DVD release yet but give it time ! ) Is there any chance of something at least half decently made , semi believable and most important ORIGINAL ? ! ? No , I thought not ..  
0	  We all know what 's like when we have a bad day at the office , right ? Well , this Neil Simon comedy looks at what it 's like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office . Sometimes , it 's just not worth going , know what I mean ? And , sometimes , it 's just not worth doing something when it 's already been done before , in 1970 , with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis .. and much better also . It 's not that Steve Martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec ; quite to the contrary , on both counts . And , it 's not that Goldie Hawn is equally inept either ; her work has been consistently good , if not great , ever since I first saw her in TV 's Rowan and Martin 's Laugh-In of the 1960s . The problem with this movie is that it 's not about the hapless couple at all : it 's really about New York and why everybody should come to New York to live and love their lives away in married bliss  sort of  in the greatest city in the world . That 's if you 're a New Yorker .. Look , the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere , and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment . This 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess . For example , not content with the star appeal of the main players , there is a cameo ( relatively long also ) from Rudy Giuliani , then mayor of New York , as we all know . What  Giuliani bucking for President even then ? Worse  a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of New York . And then we have John Cleese , reprising his role as Basil Fawlty  but this time , as a prancing cross-dresser also  once again browbeating hotel staff , sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is , in this role . And , in the process , doing great damage to the memory of Fawlty Towers , arguably the best British comedy series , bar none .. Why was this 1999 movie made ? In the 1970s , New York was a dying city , in many ways . It was almost literally bankrupt . So , when made in 1970 , that was the city you saw : grim , dark , moody , unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke ( as it was then , polluted and all ) . By 1999 , things had gotten better : glitz was back , New York was thriving , it was the Big Apple , ready for you to bite into , if you had the moxie .. So , naturally , the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the American dream of life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . Hence , this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged . As much as I like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn in comedy , this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great Jack Lemmon . If you 've seen the latter , then definitely don't bother with this one .  
1	  What 's not to like about this movie ? Every year you know that you 're going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible . This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well . A very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him . What is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it . It was a win-win situation . A regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he imagined . Only if . Drew Latham ( Ben Affleck ) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands . It was a fun and funny movie .  
0	  The comparison is perhaps unfair , but inevitable . Those attracted to the intimacy and depth of Umbrellas will be slightly horrified to discover a cut-and-paste musical in the American style - awkward , stilted dialogue with inexplicable song-and-dance numbers . Gene Kelly 's French accent was apparently so poor , that a dreadful job of dubbing was substituted ( as you 'll remember , the dubbing was almost perfectly pulled off in Umbrellas ) . The translation of the French ( for subtitled versions ) , as well , leaves something to be desired , although this can't be attributed to Demy . The film also has several self-aware moments that come off a wee disconcerting , such as references in songs to LeGrand himself . And the costumes - well , the tight pants / white boots combination , and the freakishly unnatural colors , reminds one of an Austin Powers film . . . But Demy does reward the viewer with allusions to Umbrellas ; note , for instance , the suitcase carried by Maxence in his departure from Rochefort - this is the same suitcase carried by Guy in his departure from Cherbourg . Also , note the " Convenient Brunette of Resolution " - Madeleine in Umbrellas , and Josette in Young Girls . Generally speaking , those expecting the natural feel of Umbrellas ( save the floating bicycle scene ) , or looking for similar deeper questions and ambiguous endings as in Umbrella 's script , should probably pass this one b y . Those looking for a French version of a thin ' 60s American musical will be quite happy .  
1	  I recently got the chance to view " The Waterdance " , and quite liked it . I don't really understand why its called that as there isn't really any dancing going on there , except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end . We are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie , invalids in a hospital . The story shows a love affair between a physically sisabled guy and a healthy woman , which is a very sweet story . Unfortunately , you don't get to see movies like that today . Im not " stuck in a time warp " , im not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today , but I really think the movie industry is deteriorating and there 's much we can learn from old movies-by old movies i mean anything from 1920-1998 .  
0	  When viewing a movie as silly as ' Hot Rod , ' one must sit back , relax , and alter one 's intellectual capacity to a like state  which is , in this case , a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy . With a brief runtime of 88 minutes , this film was long past drawn-out and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes  jokes that came at a minority and weren't even funny in the first place . ' Hot Rod 's base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004 's cult hit ' Napoleon Dynamite , ' though it 's much more contrived and comes without ANY of the laughter . In fact , the movie 's blatant desperation to be compared to ' Napoleon Dynamite ' is scornful and offensive , and left me ticked off , instead of just being annoyed . The movie , if one were compelled enough to call it such , poses a paltry story that puts self-proclaimed stuntman Rod Kimble before us , with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses ( one more than his idol Evel Knievel jumped , so we 're told by Rod ) and raising $ 50,000 dollars for his stepfather 's impending life-saving heart operation ; all so that he can fight his stepfather , once recovered , and gain his respect because in order to gain one 's respect , one must first fight them . Huh ? Whatever . Each character is no more interesting than Rod 's stick-on mustache , and from the film 's opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion , each scene played like a nonsensical , and terribly unfunny , SNL skit  which , with the addition of an extra 85 minutes , is , essentially , what ' Hot Rod ' strives to be . The film 's star , Andy Samberg , contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last drip-drop of his comedic capabilities . Unfortunately  rather , realistically  his humorous talents are no more admirable than a five-year-old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and pee-pee gags . And if that 's disappointing , pull a chair , hide your face in your hands , and brace yourself for the real blow : he IS the film 's humor ! To rescue them of their mortification , I 'll willingly omit the ghastliness of Samberg 's co-stars ' roles and leave the second third of The Lonely Island team , director Akiva Schaffer , to his non-existent talent as a director or a comedian . Basically , every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crash-course comedy is perfectly portrayed here ; and done so arrogantly , as though the film would be funnier that way . Trick yourself into believing that there 's even a single laugh in this heap , or treat yourself to another movie  ANY other movie .  
0	  I rarely comment on films but I 've read the other comments and I cannot believe that there are people applauding this celluloid rubbish . I know there are certain people who have their own agenda but lets take it on merit ; poorly acted , badly shot and the story felt as the director was making it up as he was going along . I am not going to focus on the sexual aspect of the film involving little kids as the makers of the film obviously knew what they wanted and what their audience would want . All I can say is it is a terrible film , the content is poor and offensive , the production is amateurish and I am glad they could not make a film like this legally today  
1	  I read the negative comments before viewing this film and undeterred , went ahead and started watching . I admit that I had to rewind quite a few times as the film is incredibly complex , involved and full of detail . That is a good thing but also , quite unexpected in this culture of car chases , explosions , gratuitous sex and general violence that substitute for plot and character development . In fact , what a welcome departure , however , I am so used to not paying a lot of attention to what I watch . This film is chock full of character development and plot line ; the kind that we used to analyze when I was in high school . It requires actual mental participation on the part of the viewer . What a nice change . I would compare it to ' All The President 's Men ' in terms of generic subject matter . That is , it is a mystery about intense misconduct on the part of elected officials and those with enough influence upon officials to essentially ' own ' them . Unlike ' All The President 's Men ' , this film makes an effort to give a couple of the characters actual personality . In this sense the movie is a character study like ' The Negotiatior ' with Samuel Jackson and Kevin Spacey . In that movie , their characters are both city employees and the plot is extremely intense . Yet , the plot is dependent on the ability of their characters to cooperate with each other , trust each , and ultimately unite together against the corrupt Police Department . There is more gun fire in this film and the specific plot is different but generically , there are many similarities . I WILL say that City Hall requires a whole lot more concentration . In fact , I was struck how parallel it was to past and present political scandals I 've seen in my life going back to Watergate . The thing is , the public knows that something is wrong , for sure ! but following the details is hard to do . This movie is not even close to being as complex as real life but it actually is realistic to life in its complexity . I think that is one of the reasons that previous posters have criticized the film : unrealistic expectations . If one watches this knowing what they are about to see and are up to the experience , it really is excellent ! I watched it 3 times in a row ! The acting is superb and the directing is flawless . The weakest link is John Cusak 's accent .  
0	  So don't even think about renting this from the shops , because this is one hell of a bad movie . You 'd think that JJ Abrahams had written this movie . Basically , a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out . Fans of the completely terrible " Shrek " might enjoy , but " Wallace & Gromit " fans will probably turn away in disgust . Also , why didn't they do it in plasticine or clay ? I mean , CGI animation ? For an AARDMAN movie ? ! Obviously , Aardman lazed around while they let Dreamworks do the whole thing . Wrong , wrong , WRONG ! Nearly every single character is awful , apart from that freaky frog guy , who is just right for a movie villain . But everything else about the movie is DULL , DULL , DULL ! I almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie . No , wait , actually , I DID fall asleep with boredom watching this movie . It 's just terrible . But thankfully , it 's not as bad as " Shrek . "  
1	  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is a very lost player in the short cartoon market . This market is essentially dominated by the Looney Tunes and the Merry Melodies shorts , coming from Warner Bros . But MGM is also able of releasing hidden gems , like " To Spring " , an astonishing story about the most beautiful season of the year . In the environment depicted here , spring isn't caused by natural cycles , but is fabricated . And by who ? By little male elves who live below ground . Each spring , when the snow begins to melt , they start working . They begin by felling rainbow rock columns , then reducing them to rubble and using this rubble to turn it into color fluids , which will be moved up to the ground and bearing grass , flowers .. In other words , spring ! The first half of the cartoon depicts spring 's fabrication , but the second part is a little bit different . Old Man Winter comes back and he tries to extend winter by destroying the elves ' work . So from this point , we assist to a battle between the elves and Old Man Winter . The music heard here is deliciously wonderful . The melodic parts stick in the head like an ink spot on a paper sheet . The second part melodies are thrilling and they perfectly fit with the action . This is just fantastico , Giorgio ! The animation sequences are also a delight . The colors are well mixed and every little detail is shown into a massive , epic environment . The concept itself is brilliant . The elves are attracting characters , so is Old Man Winter , who effectively portrays the cold and ruthless feelings of the white season . There 's also a strong message included here . The battle seems lost for the elves at the end , until a single late arriving elf jump into the action and it leads to the elves ' victory over winter . So the point is : only one single person can make the difference . In conclusion , " To Spring " is a remarkable lost classic from short cartoon era . What is even more remarkable is that this cartoon 's director made his debut here . And who is " To Spring " ' s director ? It 's a certain William Hanna ..  
0	  I hate this movie . It is a horrid movie . Sean Young 's character is completely unsympathetic . Her performance is wooden at best . The storyline is completely predictable , and completely uninteresting . I would never recommend this film to anyone . It is one of the worst movies I have ever had the misfortune to see .  
0	  This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen in the cinema ! Could not wait for it to end . To make matters worse it is given a 12A certificate so you do not see anyone getting shot , just bodies slumping to the ground , even Babban getting killed was cut out ! Too many scenes were cut to bring in the younger viewers as I think the makers knew it would flop disastrously ! Amitabhs acting was great but that ' Basanti ' wannabe and the other idiot who plays Devgans mate can't even act . Devgan was wasted ! I would not watch this for free again and I advise all others who read this to do just the same YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED !  
1	  This movie was very good . If you are one who likes to watch horror movies , I recommend it . The acting was very good although I thought that the actress playing Julie could have had more emotion behind her lines . Allan was very good and I thought the cinematography was amazing . I was on the edge of my seat the entire time while my friends were freaking out and screaming . It was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen . I give it two thumbs up ! I definitely would say that if you haven't already seen it then go rent it . If you have seen it and didn't like it go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal . I also liked how a lot of the movie was filmed around and on my school 's campus .  
0	  It 's pretty bad when the generic movie synopsis has more information than the film itself . The paragraph-long " plot summary " written on the movie page has details I could not glean from watching the actual movie . I found myself constantly backing it up to see what details I had just missed which could tell me what the ( bleep ) was going on . Alas , to no avail-this movie leaves out monstrous pieces of the story , if you could call it a story . It 's like they were trying to fool us into thinking that there was some kind of movie here , filming just enough so that there was the resemblance of a story and leaving the rest to our imaginations . Newsflash to the the creators : I paid to watch you MAKE a movie . I can sit home and imagine plots and story lines for free . And Rosario Dawson ? This is somebody I 've never paid enough attention to to be able to put the name to the face , and I can see why . She had one of the most artificial performances I have ever seen for a leading character in any movie , A or B. I figured okay , maybe she didn't really want the role , just got a hefty offer for a movie she wasn't into ? Wrong . She was listed as one of the producers . Next time you produce something , don't book yourself as the lead if you can't act . If you really can , then create a decent character for you to become . Also , somebody here mentioned the white / latino issue-yes , I hate to say it , but this movie does come across as an act of vengeance against white college-age males who wear baseball hats . That 's what happens when there is nothing in the movie to endear the watcher to latino characters . The Adrian character seems like a cocky jerk who is no better than the story 's antagonist . As for the Maya character , she didn't seem like a real person . Anyway I 'm ashamed for Hollywood that this movie was even made .  
0	  First off , I have to say that I loved the book Animal Farm . I read it with my 9th grade class , and it was great . We also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial . The movie was so disappointing to me . The movie cuts out some characters , and misses a lot of the main points of the book . It skips around a lot , and doesn't explain anything in detail . If someone was watching this movie without having first read the book , they would be confused . The most disappointing thing in this movie to me , was the ending . The ending in the book was the most powerful , and in the movie , they changed it ! It was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of " melting " together , but instead , the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs . To sum up , I don't think that this movie captured the real meaning that Orwell portrayed in his book .  
1	  This is superb - the acting wonderful , sets , clothes , music - but most of all the story itself . I am amazed there aren't more reviews of this movie - certainly one of the best of the 1980s . It 's also a wonderful movie to see in tandem with the great " Random Harvest " which has much the same opening crisis - a middle aged , unknown English W.W.I officer is in a hospital toward the close of the war , suffering from shell shock and complete amnesia without any idea of his name , origin , or anywhere he belongs - he proves to be a very wealthy established man - when he " recovers " , he will not remember the years before the war - But there the movies ' resemblances end . My warmest thanks to all who participated in the movie - particularly the actors Ian Holm , Alan Bates , Ann Margret ( what a great and surprising casting choice ) , Glenda Jackson , Julie Christie . This one stays with you forever .  
1	  We always watch American movies with their particular accents from each region ( south , west , etc ) . We have the same here . All foreign people must to watch this movie and need to have a open mind to accept another culture , besides American and European almost dominate the cinematographic industry . This movie tell us about a parallel world which it isn't figured even for those who live in a big city like São Paulo . All actors are improvising and they are very realistic . The camera give us an idea of their confuse world , the loneliness of each character and invite us to share their world . It 's a real great movie and worst a rent even have it at home .  
0	  I saw this film numerous times in the late 60 's / early 70 's whenever it reared it 's head like a reindeer with rabies every November-December as a Saturday matinée kiddie show . It was always stiff competition for THE CHRSTMAS THAT ALMOST WASN'T ( oops-can I SAY " Christmas " ? ) , perhaps the greatest , most iconic Christmas-season film of all time . But that 's another review . At the time , I marveled that the on-screen tint of SANTA CLAUS was almost " pink and white " , so much had the color of the sprocket-torn prints changed color . The film is kinda creepy ! I thought so then-and still do , actually . I was highly entertained then , as I still am ! It 's amusing in a " retarted-elf " sort of way . By the way , the image quality looks much better on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater , circa 1969-74 . If you are expecting maybe " the lost RANKIN-BASS Christmas special-forget it ! If you want FELLINI DOES Christmas-read on .. By nature , the dubbing on these foreign films ( the original version here was in Spanish ) always makes them seem " surreal " . This adds to the films inherent oddness . It is also pretty scary in that a " mishevious demon " ( as described in the original US trailer ) spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids " evil " . One particularly nightmarish scene has a young " latch-key " boy wishing he had parents for Christmas-suddenly the " port-a-family " emerges out of giant " Christmas presents of the mind " until he realizes he 's just daydreaming ! See this , Christmas lovers-and if you 're a stoner , save your stash-this film will make you think you 're hallucinating .. without drugs !  
1	  I found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is geared more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand . A few things are inappropriate for the kiddies , but just a few . Othewise , " The Grinch " ( Jim Carrey ) cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with them all , ranging from sexual to cultural to insider-Hollywood to racial . The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD . The little girl in here , " Cindy Lou Who " ( Taylor Momsen ) is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view . Anthony Hopkins ' voice is pleasing , too , so having his narrate this elevates the movie further . His rhymes are fun to hear . I saw this in the theater , though it was " fair , " but on DVD , it was far better . I 've seen in three times and it got better each time .  
0	  I know it 's a Power-Rangers gimmick and catered to 7 year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie ? If they are going to write a plot with crayons , at least have the decency to make it silly . It 's kind of hilarious if you watch this . We have a typical family filled with cliched characters ( father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself LOLOL ) , air-head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting , and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space . Funny stuff ! However , the real great moment comes near the end when war-dad and bad-acting-villain try to work a sword fight , but then they realize none of them know how to ( probably because no room in budget for choreographers ) , so they come up with this American Gladiator type setting to run around in . LOL . 1/10 rating because they try to treat this seriously .  
0	  This film concerns the story of Eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming to old friends in a seaside community . The plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that Eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible . But this is inconsequential , as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized . Screenplays not always need be ' chatty ' , but they should at least assist the development of the story . Here one line attempts such as " he just took off " or " I know you don't have love in heart " just do fully evoke something worth the audience 's time . Also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music . Talk about trying to hard . If you are interested in a good film , the type that gives quality and substance over just style then this is not the film for you .  
1	  An excellent movie . Superb acting by Mary Alice , Phillip M. Thomas , and a young Irene Cara . Tony King was very realistic in his role of Satin . This movie was one of the last predominately " all black " movies of the 70 's and unlike the " blaxploitation " movies of that era , this movie actually had a plot , and was very well done . The movie soundtrack , sung by Aretha Franklin , was popular on the R & B charts at the time .  
0	  Those of you who , like me , were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn , " The Fear " will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel . It sort of follows a similar plot , but it is impossible to connect to the original , with the exception of the presence of Morty , the mannequin monster made of wood . Here is a brief overview . Twenty years after Mike Hawthorne ( Gordon Currie , in a decent performance ) witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life , Mike is still suffering from the fear of that day . In hopes of ridding his fear , Mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents ' home . His plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears , and then present the fears to the mannequin Morty . According to an Indian friend , this process is supposed to magically take away one 's fear . What Mike doesn't know is that Morty is possessed with his father 's spirit , and begins killing off the friends .. or is it really Mike himself doing the killings ? Who cares ? A have a few troubles with this film . The first lies with Morty . I thought the original made Morty look rather convincing . This time , it is painfully obvious Morty is a man ( actor Jon Fedele ) in a fake looking suit . This can especially be seen in early scenes , where Morty is still supposed to be inanimate , but if you watch closely you can see him blinking . Another trouble is that most of the characters don't try hard enough . Some of them do , namely Betsy Palmer , of Friday the 13th fame , who was excellent in this film . But most of them don't make the effort or weren't given the chance . Finally , there are the killings . The opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing . Actually , when I saw them I thought I was in for a good movie . When the second half of the movie arrives , and the killings really start , everything falls to pieces . Deaths are either uncreative , unseen , or foreseen ( glimpses of the next scene as Currie has a blackout ) . One character dies in the end and no one , including the viewer , even notices . While more characterization was needed in the beginning half , it wasn't too bad . The second half was . I think new director Chris Angel got to this point and really didn't know how to shoot the violent scenes , so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian . A silly ending doesn't help either . Thus , unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin , you should probably skip " The Fear 2 : Halloween Night . " Zanatos ' score : 4 out of 10 .  
0	  Yes , it can be done . John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic , horror , Sc-Fi musical . If there is any acting , it is terrible or way over the top . Special effects ; take your pick .. very low budget or kindergarten . Every cheap cliché thought of is used . No doubt a fun movie to watch . Worth a cold six-pack or two . Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse . Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind . San Diego is a good place as any to start . Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace . This cult favorite features : David Miller , Eric Christmas , Al Sklar , Tom Coleman , Sharon Taylor and John Qualls .  
0	  WORST MOVIE EVER ! Can't believe I wasted 90min of my life watching this crap . The only reason I didn't turn it off was I wanted to see the Gangster dude on the cover and he wasn't even in it talk about False advertising . The people that gave this movie a ten are either Dumb , Stupid or CAST MEMBERS or friends of CAST MEMBERS . I gave it a solid 2 because no one else did I have to write more and I don't even want to . wasting my time talking about this rubbish . Please don't watch it and if you did then vote so this movie can go where it belongs . bottom 100 movies . i can't even tell you how bad it really is . think the worst movie ever that you 've seen then times that be ten and thats this movie . It sucked ! If you just think I 'm being bitter then watch it I dare You ! This movie should be used to torture war criminals or Terriosts . If they Watch this even two times and they 'll be spilling the beans and begging for MERCY !  
0	  This program didn't do it for me , although I 'm a fan of the genre . The major factor that disappointed me was that there was not a single scene which was not dominated by the main character . This made it a bit two-dimensional and I gave up before the program was over . I was hoping to leave my critique there as I 'm no movie critic , however , the guidelines on IMDb state that you must put in 10 lines of commentary . It did remind me of Hudson Hawk in the way the main character is in every single scene , and I would hope that the writers of this program could employ some more diversity to engage with the viewers . I don't doubt the talent of any of the cast and crew , it 's just that after watching things like " the wire " , I 've come to expect great things from cop drama .  
0	  I was unlucky enough to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival . Sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin . Being a devout fan of Lewis Carroll 's ' Alice ' books I was very excited about this movie 's premier , which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch . Normally I 'm enthusiastic about modern re-tellings if they are treated well . Usually it 's interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story . Unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion . The adaptation of the original 's characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying . It probably didn't help that the actors weren't very good either . Most performances were ridiculously over the top , which I assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script . I did not laugh once through out the duration of the film . All of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by . Really , the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet Alice , but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman 's work . Also , I 'd have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance-off was awful . It was with out a doubt the low point of the film . What a joke . Don't see this movie . After its conclusion I was genuinely angry .  
1	  Of all the breakdancing / hip-hop films released between 1983 and 1986 , the 1984 film Beat Street is unquestionably the best one . The story follows a DJ , his younger breakdancing brother , a graffiti artist and a wanna-be showbiz promoter through one winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto using their " street " talent . The acting isn't always up to par and the characters aren't fully drawn out , but they are more than compensated for by down-to-earth dialogue , a plausible story , fantastic dancing sequences and a timeless hip-hop sound track . It should be noted this film was shot in the birthplace of breakdancing ( " This ain't New York , this is the Bronx ! " ) , and features appearances by the fathers of breakdancing , dance troupe Rock Steady Crew and rapper Afrika Bambaata . Rock Steady Crew provide the best scene in the film when they dominate a dance battle at the premiere breakdancing club of the early 80 's , the Roxy . A must see for hip-hop lovers .  
0	  .. and an extremely bad one at that ! How long did this train-wreck last ? 14 episodes or something ? I can see why now . I bought the " Serenity " episode from Amazon Unboxed . It was my first purchase , so was free . That is the ONLY good thing about the experience ( incident ? ) I won't comment really on the acting , since these were , I guess , fairly new people who hadn't really gotten the job down just right yet . At least I 've never seen them before in any type of major show , theater or TV . If I did , then I have easily forgotten them . But the special effects were absolutely horrendous . True , this isn't exactly a multi-million $ project , but the original Star Trek did better than this & that was THIRTY-FIVE YEARS ago . I especially got a laugh out of the bad guys ( reapers or something like that ) ship as it chased the hilarious looking Firefly , with smoke coming out of the engines looking something like a gigantic model rocket . I fully expected to eventually see the Wiley Coyote riding on top , while chasing after the Roadrunner . MODERN jet / rocket engines don't even do it that bad . And that wasn't even the worst of it . The wild-west type shoot-outs had me wondering if I was actually watching a sci-fi film or a Gene Autry one . Regardless of the hype , don't waste your time .. I did .. all 80-something minutes of the disaster called " Firefly " .  
0	  Being a Film studies graduate I would like to think that I have seen a diverse range of films , some good and some bad , but I would have to say that ' Summer rain ' is by far the worse film I have ever seen ! I chose the film in the hope that it was going to be a great British classic such as ' Secrets and Lies ' or ' Lockstock ' but oh no this was so bad that my flat mates and I ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous acting and cheesy script ( reminded me of a bad ' theatre in education ' school production ) . The main characters Michelle and Gary began to annoy us from the start . ' Michelle ' the main character who lives with her two friends has the type of face that you would never get tired of slapping and Gary was so wet ( he kept breaking down in tears every 5 minutes ) that by the end of the film I really didn't give a damn about either of them . All I could think was ' I paid £3 for this pile ' . I have never written a review before but after watching this film it has spurred me on to warn people of this disastrous production . So please avoid at all costs . Thanks for reading .  
1	  Not wishing to give * anything * away here , I would just say this technically excellent , flawlessly acted and uplifting little flic will reward the viewer with an excellent hour and a half 's entertainment : It will amuse , surprise , possibly embarrass occasionally and almost certainly tug at the heartstrings from time to time , as it approaches the inevitable , but not obvious , ending without becoming clichéd or predictable in any way . Most definitely recommended . A previous User 's Comment gives 8 out of 10 for the film and 10 out of 10 for both Branagh and Bonham-Carter 's outstanding performances - I agree entirely ..  
0	  This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies Stallone ever made . This is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself . " First Blood Pt . 2 " is very similar to Schwarzenegger 's " Commando " , but there you have Arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys . This movie is a typical American anti-Soviet propaganda . True , this was the peak of the Cold War , but I 'm sick of having Communists or the Nazis always being shown as the enemy . There are so many American movies that have this one thing in common . Why can't there a movie that show Americans as the enemy ? Who 's going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army ? Do you really think that something like this would have really happened ? By the looks of it , an average , brain washed American viewer certainly would .  
1	  Pickup on South Street ( 1953 ) , directed by movie maverick Samuel Fuller , contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication . Subway rider Candy ( Susan Peters ) collides with pickpocket Skip McCoy ( Richard Widmark dipped in shades of Sinatra cool ) . She 's unaware that she carries valuable microfilm ; McCoy is unaware of grifting it . Both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents . Thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges . Candy is doubly watched ( Skip and the police ) and therefore doubly naive ; Skip , the overconfident petty thief , is singularly unaware , trailed by federal agents ; the feds , all knowing , are ultimately helpless . They can't stop the " passing " of government secrets or the spread of communism .  
0	  Complete waste of time .. This movie is not comedy , it 's not drama , it 's not romance .. not even teenage comedy at least ! Story .. it should be some turn-over one end .. but it 's so disappointing ! When movie has a turn-over on end I expect that turn-over to make movie even better ( exp . " Fight Club " ) but this turn-over makes movie even worse .. When I watch teenage comedy , and I don't do that very often , I expect lousy jokes and bunch of nudeness .. Jokes are too lousy and there is no nudity .. You got only one .. very good looking I must admit .. girl , and that 's that ! And she 's fully dressed whole movie ! Acting is bad .. like soap series .. Don't waste your time ! There are porns with better story and acting ! ( sorry on my bad English )  
0	  To say Funky Forest : The First Contact is a bad movie is an understatement of incredible proportions . I can really get into a good art house film , even a surreal and twisted romp like El Topo , Naked Lunch , and Survive Style 5 + , because those movies actually have something worth discussing when the credits roll . FFC attempts at every avenue to be this deep and intellectual , essentially there is no substance in this movie . This movie is badly done , the visuals in this movie are not inspiring , the dialog is worse , the musical numbers destroy this movie .. I chuckled for GUITAR BROTHERS , but that was immediately wiped out by something completely unnecessary , and irrelevant . It attempted to be deep and meaningful I think , but its just pretentious disoriented nonsense . Freshman film students without a camera could craft something more interesting . Guitar Brothers and the stand up routines in between skits get 1 point each , everything else is just badly paced , pseudo-creative , heavy handed attempts at being AS good as films by other REAL directors like , Sogo Ishii , David Lynch , and Jodoworsky . Give me a break . I am convinced that people that rave about FFC are doing so because they have no idea of what they saw , because it was nothing but mild pertinent statements here and there mixed with stupidity and blended until you puke on your own shoes . This movie was an extreme disappointment , coming off the high that was Survive Style 5 + , a film that actually has meaning , combined with excellent use of scenery , cinematography , catchy dialog , funny moments , good soundtrack , excellent performances , fantastic pacing and flow . FFC features the exact opposite in every way , boring scenery ( 20 minutes staring at a bland beach at night ? a completely white stage ? Alien balls floating in white space ? a dinky school hallway and then a .. school hallway ? ) , terrible cinematography , forgettable dialog , nothing funny or humorous , save the fact you just wasted your life for two hours , soundtrack ? , amateurish performances , uneven , disjointed , and often flat out dragging pacing , zero flow whatsoever . There are those that claim this is what makes FFC a great movie , that it is so unconventional at every turn that its pure genius . This is simply a way to stroke your own ego it seems , because " unpredictable " could be a good quality for a film if it wasn't coupled with " boring " , " innane " , and " terrible " . Personally I have spoken with two people who admitted to me that FFC was terrible when they left the theater , but overwhelming rave by art-house elitist made them watch the movie again and then come back to me with a .. " Hey it was pretty good I liked it " . I 'm going to put my foot down , this movie is slop , I don't care if Roger Ebert says this film is the best thing he 's ever watched since he lost his own virginity . " The Emperor 's new cloak " I say .. this movie is no way indicative of the other psychedelic / trippy films to come from Japan in the last 10 years . Taste of Tea , Party 7 , and Kamikaze Girls are much better movies ( even with a low budget ) , and none can honestly compare with Survive Style 5 + . Watch FFC only if your interested in making a pretentious pile of nothing on a shoestring budget .
